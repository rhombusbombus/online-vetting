Bottom of the Hill,Gerald H.,"Fairfield, CA","Feb 25, 2024","Such an iconic venue in the city. We attended a private event there that had an open bar and small bites. Drinks and the bartender was great and the small bites menu were great.  There is a cozy section with a fireplace in the back and a small outdoor patio. Street parking only so you know how that is in the city. The venue was clean,  bathrooms clean and it felt safe for the area.  It's a good old fashion music venue everyone should visit at least once. Google it's history for famous artist that performed here.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Patrick G.,"San Francisco, CA","Dec 13, 2023","draft beers were pretty expensive and the tech for the music wasn't working. Artist had to request tech changes. Besides that, cool decor and cool crowd. Dive bar for sure",3
Bottom of the Hill,Jess L.,"San Francisco, CA","Nov 21, 2023","Love this venue. Strong drinks, dingy bathrooms, intimate stage, cool patio space! I've been here a couple times and it's always a great time!",5
Bottom of the Hill,Jessica D.,"San Mateo, CA","Oct 13, 2023","This is just a very cool venue. Bands are great and drinks are strong. Everyone is super nice and welcoming. Love the band posters and decor, definitely see a show here.",5
Bottom of the Hill,D.Bruce S.,"Averyville, Peoria, IL","Aug 19, 2023",Decades of great music. Kozic's legacy is proudly displayed in these storied walls. After 30 years I returned to the bay for a weekend and Friday Night BotH was hosting Off With Their Heads. So much of the music has left SF but this place remains as a crucial space for great music. Do yourself a favor and check out whoever's playing there.,5
Bottom of the Hill,jelina h.,"Alhambra, CA","May 26, 2023","Had the most amazing concert here for the Symposium! Venue is super intimate and everywhere you turn there is something new and interesting to admire. I loved the wall of past bands; it offers some neat music history. I also passed out before the show (I'm fine, just got overheated) and the staff was so caring and attentive. They gave me water and juice and let me sit by the bar to watch the beginning of the show while I recovered. If they see this, thank you so much!!!",5
Bottom of the Hill,Jay C.,"San Lorenzo, CA","May 26, 2023","Love this venue ! Inexpensive concert tickets and the vibes are fun and intimate . Everyone in the venue is friendly , from the bartenders to the people at the door . Food is also good and reasonably priced . They even have coat check so feel free to bring a jacket for the line",5
Bottom of the Hill,Jeff L.,"CA, CA","Mar 27, 2023",Great little venue for a concert. If you like small bands in a small place this is the place to go. Had a great time and drinks were very reasonable. Top notch performance from the bands we saw!,4
Bottom of the Hill,Charlotte H.,"San Francisco, CA","Feb 17, 2023","Been to this venue twice and I have an amazing night every time. The place is very intimate and well decorated with seats and tables in the back as well as a cute patio outside with a window where you can still see the band inside. I haven't eaten anything here but the drinks are great and they have free accessible water which is super helpful. Street parking is so easy, I wouldn't worry about that. Also, there's a dispensary nearby as well as a bar with some great food that you can rest at between shows. I recently went for a ""valentines fest"" show with a few bands that I love and they totally decked out the place in fun decoration which made the experience so much better.",5

Bottom of the Hill,Mildred R.,"San Francisco, CA","Nov 16, 2022","Came to listen to the performances of the bands. Tickets were not expensive. Atmospheric and soulful, but there are few places.",5
Bottom of the Hill,John S.,"San Francisco, CA","Nov 12, 2022","I don't have much to add. I saw Buck-O-Nine and Mustard Plug here. It had been so long since I'd been that I totally forgot what the stage looked like and even where it was. It's way smaller than I remembered, which guarantees a good show, unless the crowd doesn't know what it's doing, and every time I've been here, the crowd has known what it's doing.Super cheap tickets, no idiotic service charges. You save like two bucks for pre-buying. Plus the pre-buy setup is old-fashioned. They email a bunch of people, and you're on a list. I love it.The crowning glory on this occasion was they were looping a Killer Klowns from Outer Space DVD on the small TV on mute above the bar. In between sets and at other times, I found myself unable not to watch. It's scary even though it's not even though it's terrifying. Like utterly bone-chilling. The special effects suck, and they mostly sucked in 1988 as well. The decapitation part is the least scary part of the entire film. But the slow, silent chases! Give me more.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Sierra P.,"Yuba City, CA","Aug 10, 2022","If you know you know, if you don't, go find out! This place is just as fun to roam around & look at, as it is to watch a show. When the music stops, get yourself a drink & head to the patio that is covered in nature & art. The texture, the sound, the environment all if it was a blast .",5
Bottom of the Hill,Paul L.,"Yukon, OK","Jul 28, 2022","Me and a friend went here to see one of my favorite bands. My friend insisted on driving for some reason. When we finally entered the venue there wasn't space to breathe. I mean, genuinely packed! The bar was cash only but it was so packed that you wouldn't dare try to buy a drink there unless you were desperate. We left the venue early because we were both super uncomfortable and walked to my friends car that was broken into (back window was broken.) if I could go back in time and told my friend not to go I would. The crowd was bizzare and bumping into other people without saying sorry is the norm.",1
Bottom of the Hill,Jen T.,"Philadelphia, PA","Jul 8, 2022","EIGHT. DOLLAR. COCKTAILS. Like, what? Nowhere in SF can you get cocktails for $8 when it's not happy hour. And while they aren't the most delicious, who cares? They get the job done. You go for the music, the $8 cocktails are just a bonus. Great sound in an intimate venue, lots of diverse acts. Check them out! Find new music! Have fun!",5

Bottom of the Hill,Kaylah G.,"Sonoma, CA","Oct 8, 2021",Shows amazing as always! One bartender (I didn't get names unfortunately) was amazing! She was blonde and so nice. Made sure my friends and I's bags were safe all night. There was a younger bartender with dark hair that was so unprofessional and rude. I was trying to give the blonde girl a nice tip for being so great and the other girl flipped out. Considering she was probably in her thirties she should know how to better treat customers. Venue as a whole is amazing though.,4
Bottom of the Hill,Daniel K.,"Pacifica, CA","Mar 26, 2021",I want to update my petty review and apologize  to bottom of the hill.  It's not their fault there's a lot of desperate people in the city.

Bottom of the Hill,Ivan S.,"Sunnyvale, CA","Oct 12, 2020","Hmmm. A brief indie music history refresher...... Brought my older brother here for an amazing evening with Lali Puna, Alias (Brenden W) and duo 505, 11/2004. A 10 d sold out show of the MORR art label and artist roster. The show itself as in performance of each group and artist were absolutely fabulous. 5 stars, bravo!!  LP opened, followed by Brandon and a closing set by duo 505. I was a fan of the trio so I had lots of fun following music parts, melodies, lyrics and poppy game boy like, instrumental 8-bit tangents. I had an extreme penchant with the German pop label MORR music headed by Thomas MORR, which still to this day I think is a pseudonym.

Bottom of the Hill,Jessica T.,"San Francisco, CA","May 15, 2020","My husband and I  - had our wedding party here    some years ago. It was a beautiful evening full of wide smiles, beaming toasts, watermelon cake, guacamole, colorful outfits, handmade rice-krispy treats, sunflowers, singing, dancing, and lots of love. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect venue to celebrate our union. Lynn and the rest of the amazing staff at Bottom of the Hill were a dream to work with. They answered all of our questions thoroughly and quickly leading up the event, and once we got there- they even helped make sure everything was all set-up.We were able to park a vintage VW bus outside for photos, bring in outside caterers with chafing dishes, and have live music throughout the festivities. From Bottom of the Hill's quirky decor, to its charming fireplace, to its lovely succulent graced outdoor area - it's a one-of-a-kind space. It's an amazing haven in the Bay Area full of heart and life - run by truly magical people.Help support the wonderful people who keep outstanding live music alive in San Francisco - and please consider donating to their staff relief fund here - http://www.bottomofthehill.com/donatetostaff.htmlTrust.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Safi H.,"Brooklyn, New York, NY","Feb 16, 2020","had a good time at first; small intimate venue to see a wonderful band but a guard there continuously kept harassing one of my friends because she had too much to drink. it was concerning how eager he was to kick her out on the street; he just wanted to get rid of her, regardless of her safety. he also treated other women at the venue incredibly disrespectfully. his presence didn't make anyone feel safer, if anything it made everyone incredibly uncomfortable. if the security staff is this disrespectful and terrifying, i will never come back. avoid at All costs. please fire the thin white man with long hair and beard. he is a Creep. drinks are overpriced too.",1

Bottom of the Hill,Alex H.,"Omaha, NE","Dec 5, 2019",The bouncer literally tried to take away my REAL ID so I suggest any new comers to try and STAY CLEAR of this bar. Astonishingly disrespectful staff is all I have to say! 0 out of 10 stars if I had a say in it. Stay safe y'all...,1
Bottom of the Hill,Jessika F.,"Indianapolis, IN","Nov 18, 2019","What a treasure this venue is! Saw a show here this weekend and the whole experience start to finish was pleasant. There is a lovely patio outside the back door with plenty of seating or room for socializing. There are a number of dinner tables sort of restaurant-style in the rear of the venue, away from/kindof behind the main floor. These areas are a much appreciated escape from the crowds if needed. I saw food being served, though I didn't eat I'm happy this is an option if needed. Bartenders were very friendly and quick! This venue is cash only but there's an ATM inside. I thought the sound mixing during the performances was great. Looking forward to returning soon!",5
Bottom of the Hill,c.t. d.,"San Francisco, CA","Nov 14, 2019","Legendary live music venue in FRISCO!!! I've gone to tons of amazing shows here over the years. Always when Romona is behind the bar. She booked the bands there for years and has great taste. The city needs great venues like this. Happy it's still going strong, while so many other clubs have bit the dust in SF.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Omar A.,"Arcadia, CA","Nov 9, 2019","Growing up, I always imagined Bottom of the Hill (BOTH) as a sort of mecca for punk rock in San Francisco, similar to, but nowhere near the level of importance or acclaim as Gilman on the other side of the Bay (but what even is?).All my favorite bands would play here when they were in town, but since I was in LA I would get to see them when they came to SoCal. Yet I always had the desire to visit here one day. Well that day came recently when I was able to see one of my favs from back in the day, Sicko, play a show here along with locals Mr. T Experience and the Pathogens.I don't really know what I had drawn up in my teenage mind when I first heard about this place many years ago, but like most things we imagine when we are that young, they usually don't meet up to our lofty expectations. For whatever reason, I had imagined BOTH to be a large club, similar to maybe the Troubadour or the Whiskey in LA..however it is actually a lot smaller and more intimate than the majority of the rock clubs in Hollywood. For those from LA, it's closer in size to the Echo or the Smell.On this night, the place was decorated in a Halloween theme since we were close to the holiday, which I was delighted to see. There were also past show posters framed alongside the walls which highlight the rich history of the club. If you walk towards the back there is a tiny room which was set up to sell merch.They do have a bar, but I'm sober so can't say much about that other than they do have alcohol.Tickets can be bought onsite or reserved through their website. There is will call out front where the guy basically just checks your ID to make sure it matches the person who bought the ticket online. If you're over 21, they put a wristband on your hand and if not, well I guess they don't. It is all ages though because I saw a bunch of kids inside. There is no coat check here but leave your jackets at home since it gets pretty warm indoors.The sound was good and the crowd was fun, mostly nice and not too intense on the night I went.Parking seems limited, with street level parking and a small lot out back. I took a lyft so it didn't affect me one way or the other.Overall, it was a fulfilling experience and the teenage me would be so excited that I got to go here. Heck, the current me was also excited about it too!",5
Bottom of the Hill,Nina C.,"Burlingame, CA","Sep 29, 2019","Great venue for live music! Major points for easy, free street parking in S.F. Good size dance floor, indoor seating in the back and outdoor patio, and bar featuring self-serve water. The sound was well balanced and loud without being headache inducing. Two stalls in the ladies room with purse hooks, and kept clean and stocked with TP the entire night. It got hot and stuffy inside, but that's pretty typical when there's a lot of people getting down! I look forward to more shows here.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Danny S.,"Civic Center, Stockton, CA","Sep 16, 2019",Probably my favorite venue in the city. On the smaller side but parking is the easiest here. Food is actually really good. Bring cash.,5
Bottom of the Hill,Doctor L.,"San Francisco, CA","Apr 6, 2019","Beers are $7. Cocktails are $8, and stiff.ORDER THE COCKTAILS.This is quite simply one of the best small live music venues on the West Coast, if not the US, if not the entire world.Looking around at the condos going up around here, I worry if this place will someday get gentrified out of existence. And if that shit ever happened, I swear I'd burn shit to the ground. I swear I'd burn it to the motherfucking ground.I'M OBVIOUSLY FUCKING KIDDING AND AM NOT GOING TO BURN SHIT.Regardless, that shit's not even going to happen. Those condo dwellers will have no choice but to appreciate the fine local bands and reasonably priced cocktails to not simply not gentrify this place, but to make it fucking thrive.BOTH is gonna live forever. FOR FUCKING EVER.Order the cocktails. And patronize live music while you still can.",5
Bottom of the Hill,David L.,"San Mateo, CA","Mar 4, 2019","I have only been once for a show by Sebastian Bach last year. I thought the venue was just ok. The sight lines are not great as the ceiling is low and the stage itself is small and also not too high. If you are at the front to the right of the stage, you end up blocking the walkway which means people walking into you. The venue is small/intimate with lots of character but the surrounding area is a little shady. At least the ticket prices are reasonable. I may not be back unless it is an artist I am dying to see.",3
Bottom of the Hill,Bridgette M.,"Oakland, CA","Feb 21, 2019","Me and my boyfriend just went to our first show here last night and I am in love with this venue. It is medium to small for a very intimate experience. The decor consists of a lot of eccentric, spooky, crafty things like tinsel, bead garlands, mannequin parts etc. The staff (ticket takers and bartenders) were very friendly and chill. The place is cash only but they have an ATM by their front door. The bathrooms were interesting: women's restroom has 2 small stalls but the door to the bathroom was left open so people on the main floor could look into the bathroom. I didn't really like this but maybe they do this as a safety precaution? All in all a great show and venue :)",5
Bottom of the Hill,Pallavi M.,"San Jose, CA","Dec 25, 2018",Live music 6/7 days a week :) if you're into live music it's definitely a place you need to visit. The only thing I don't like about this place is when there are just three bands playing there's a wait of 20-30 mins between bands.,5
Bottom of the Hill,Joel G.,"San Francisco, CA","Nov 7, 2018","This classic venue can almost be missed if you're walking around the neighborhood. There's a giant neon sign outside, and usually a line that goes down the block. The interior of this place hasn't changed much in the past twenty years. A tiny stage, abstract art on the walls, and small bar in the front, which gets pretty crowded. They have a nice patio area in back, perfect if you're a smoker; if not, they do have some nice vegetation to admire. The place isn't near any muni or BART stations. This venue is tiny and there's no real room to move around or dance. The place is cool for a first concert experience but can be a bit annoying if you want to try to enjoy a show.",3
Bottom of the Hill,Carl F.,"CA, CA","Sep 25, 2018","I've been to Bottom of the Hill twice. Once for an incredible 60s/70s themed wedding with an amazing David Bowie cover band, and once for a show with a band featuring men dressed like orcs from Lord Of The Rings and the headliner, a heavy metal Arnold Schwarzenegger parody militia style band that played songs about the movie Junior, Twins, Kindergarten Cop, and more.Needless to say, Bottom of the Hill has A LOT to offer. It's cash only and you'll need to check online to see what show may be going on as ticket prices/cover can vary greatly. The drinks are extremely affordable and the bartenders are so so so kind and do a great job of seeing everyone who may be in need of a drink and/or safety earplugs and servicing them stat. The venue isn't huge but I think that's kind of perfect for a show where you don't want to get crammed in and pushed around. There's a back room that I've spent about 20 seconds in but I think it's a good area to hang in if you order from their small kitchen menu. There's also a back outdoor patio with some limited seating, tons of gorgeous plants, and a pack of adorable kittens that do not want to be pet.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Hannah E.,"Redwood City, CA","Sep 16, 2018","If you enjoy multiple car break-ins, this place is for you!!. I should've heeded the warning of the people that said be wary of parking your car here. However, since they were only two of them, I figured it might not still be an issue. I was wrong. It's really insulting that they have warnings about break-ins posted as a small flyers on the window, because that shows they see and KNOW there's an issue, but their only solution is ""check your bags with us for free!""Listen, if I thought they couldn't afford some security or at least a parking area to patrol, I might be more sympathetic. But with what their drink prices were, and that it's cash-only, I know they have enough. It's simply ridiculous. Don't even go to this place. The fact that people keep returning despite these issues is just not giving them any incentive to fix anything. Now I'm out $1300 in belongings and my car has a permanent breeze. Cool. It happened to a few cars in the area it seems, too. One car was missing a gas cap after. So they will literally f*ck your sh*t up just to do it. To end on a positive: Sound system was nice inside the venue. It was a nightmare navigating to the restroom though and the lack of seating was weird. Overall literally no reason to Come back here ever. Oh. I guess there weren't many positives.",1
Bottom of the Hill,Merch C.,"San Francisco, CA","Sep 2, 2018","This place is a great live music venue. They hire an actual sound person! Not only that, but the green room is awesome. Besides comfy furniture, good lighting, and a useable mirror, it has a shower and a minifridge, and they put a cooler full of ice cold beers up there before showtime. I've only been in one better green room! The back patio is pretty nice too.",5
Bottom of the Hill,John S.,"Vacaville, CA","Jul 21, 2018","For the most part, I would give this place a 1 star; however, there were a few redeeming factors of this place: The sound and acoustics were good, the merch table was easily accessible, the bar is. . simple, and the headliner selection is incredible. On paper, this should be an excellent venue. Heck, they even let the artists play their full setlists, and each artist with the exception of the headliner started on the minute and promptly. There's even a warning sign talking about people leaving valuables in their cars. Thoughtful if you ask me.Now, that was the good, but what boils down is this: Just how responsible are these people? I can predict that they say that they are responsible for nothing unless something illegal happens here-then they just don't want to be on the short end of the stick. That's the problem here: They're in it for themselves with greed, and their attitudes show it. The door opening time for last Thursday's (it's Saturday morning now) show was 8:30 while the show was supposed to start at 9--1 headliner and two opening acts. As each opening act played for almost an hour, the artist that I'm sure we all came to see did not take the stage until 11 PM, and had a setlist that was twice as long as the others. It apparently was scheduled for the headliner to perform at that time, but I had no idea that was the case until I was there. I took public transportation to get myself to the venue. I was driving from Vacaville to the El Cerrito Plaza BART station and got off right at 16th and Mission station. Now, this venue is not the closest to the 16th and Mission station, but then again, it's not the farthest (about a 20-25 minute walk) and it isn't that far from some of the SF Peninsula's precise bus stops. Problem is, when the main event begins at 11:00 PM, don't expect it to end before midnight (or better yet 11:30 so we can have time to catch the last couple of East Bay stops at BART). Now in some ways, that's just the icing of the non-tasty cake. In line in front of me, an older gentleman and the older middle aged man who greeted said a quick ""hi"" to one another. After the the older gentleman in front of me asked the greeter how he was doing in a genuine manner, he said something among the lines of ""I want you all to bring your ID cards out so we can match your names."" The greeter's vibe and insensitivity was very curt and off-putting for me. He then asked me specifically if he could see my ID as if I was underaged. I've been working in the professional industry for some years now, don't look like I'm under 21 anymore, and haven't been carded at all in recent memory except when people must card everybody just for the sake of policy--so I was carded twice. That too was unpleasant. Also, when I was in the venue and looking on the website, I couldn't help but remind myself just how narcissistic this venue is: From a long list of every performer who played in there from 1997 to present day, to the in house staff using a professional camera with flash taking constant pictures of the performance likely for that same purpose.So to conclude this review, if the event started two hours earlier, I wouldn't have to debate which I wanted to do more: Go home safely and at an affordable price or see the full show of the headliner that I bought the ticket to see in the first place. As I really didn't want to miss the main artist's 20ish song set, I had faith that I could just walk fast enough and catch the 800 all nighter route AC Transit bus between South Van Ness and Market by a few minutes after 1:00 AM when the event ended about 15 minutes after midnight. Unfortunately since it's my first time trying to take that late bus and ever going to this venue, not only did I miss the BART's last departure but also this bus by apparently a few minutes, and just to learn that the next bus wouldn't come till at least an hour or so later. So to avoid panicking, uncertainty, and being worried, I just shelled out a pretty penny I didn't account for on an Uber to take me back to the El Cerrito Plaza station. Wow could that all have been prevented had it started and ended earlier. Considering all of these vehicle break ins I hear about, public transit is the wiser choice in SF and throughout this district, and if they don't start the events and end them at earlier times, I simply cannot justify going to a show out here again. That plus the rude vibes and narcissism they all seem to be emanating, unfortunately it is not acceptable to be a part of all of this or see another performer here until lots of that stuff (especially the times) get better. Thanks for reading my experience here.",2

Bottom of the Hill,Lydia Z.,"San Francisco, CA","Jun 29, 2018","Small and intimate venue with a bar, a stage, a patio, and an inside dining/sitting area. I have yet to see the place in the daytime/not set up for an event but I like how it was set up for the AAPI month event I attended. Lineup is written on a board so you know who to expect. They might even sell food but the service counter was closed when I arrived. Only con is there isn't really any sitting area in front of the stage besides maybe the 3 stools by the bar. The patio is actually outside behind the stage and strewn with lights and scattered chairs. Overall a delightful little place in the design district that hosts a variety of underground/rising artists. Also tickets are usually relatively cheap!",4

Bottom of the Hill,Nicole W.,"Sacramento, CA","Feb 23, 2018","This is a very solid venue. Tickets are always will call which is nice because you will never forget them! Also, every time I've come here there has always been an abundance of free parking near by, and that alone could make it my favorite venue in the city. It's a small intimate venue, which I love. If you go to a lot of concerts or have sensitive ears I would recommend bringing ear plugs. It can get pretty loud in this small space. Lots of great bands have played here and I hope to see more in the future here!",4

Bottom of the Hill,Denay M.,"SoMa, San Francisco, CA","Oct 25, 2017","MY FAVORITE VENU IN SF! Love this place.... the food is good and decently priced. The bar is cash only, which is pretty typical of a sf bar. But no matter where you when your here, inside or outside, you have a great view of the stage! The back patio has a plexiglass window so you can see behind the stage during performances. And since the ""green room"" intended for performers is super small, the artist are out and about at the venue which creates awesome meet-n-greet opportunities.

Bottom of the Hill,Kendra O.,"Morgan Hill, CA","Aug 30, 2017","Super small venue for seeing lesser-known bands. Tickets are normally pretty cheap; between $12 and $15. I saw GGFO here and we got to meet them in the back room after the show! Sound system is pretty good. I love that this place isn't located in a super busy area and there's plenty of available parking right next to the venue! My only complaint about the venue is that some areas are wayyy too cramped, especially the tiny bathroom. Other that that, it is a really great unique place for some live music.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Tim A.,"Healdsburg, CA","Jul 3, 2017","This place is awesome. Old, divey, neighborhood bar and music joint. The drinks are stiff and fair and come quickly, the vibe is good. If you're looking for music without the d-bags and bouncers and night club scene, saddle up to the bar for a bourbon and some tunes at this joint.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Marco T.,"Sea Cliff, San Francisco, CA","Jun 2, 2017","My favorite spot in town for live music and new bands.It is a small venue and that's what makes it great.All my favorite bands have stopped here at some point.I now regularly check their website to find about new bands.Just recently I went to see Vancouver Sleep Clinic, Brolly, and Picture Atlantic.",5

Bottom of the Hill,R C.,"San Leandro, CA","May 18, 2017",Went here for a Vancouver Sleep Clinic show. Space is small. Staff are friendly. The thing I love about this place is the parking.

Bottom of the Hill,Whitney D.,"Sacramento, CA","Mar 13, 2017","*CASH ONLY BAR* There's an ATM there but you know that the fees are crazy with those. I saw Milo Greene there. There's a good amount of street parking, but we got there a little early so it was probably easier then to find things. It can get pretty hot, but it was sold out so that's pretty standard. I didn't have anything from the kitchen but there is a full bar. It's a cool little space, really eclectic. If your band is coming you should really go, the tickets are cheap and it's a small venue so you're up close and personal with them. My only complaint is the bathroom. It's pretty small and it's a gender-neutral which is not a problem, but there's two urinals and one stall bathroom. When I went in it stank like old pee. Besides that, it's a cool little place.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Shoshana G.,"Benicia, CA","Feb 25, 2017","Came here last night to see Matt Pond PA as part of Noise Pop 2017. Bottom of the Hill is a great live music venue. Check-in was a breeze - show your ID at the door and then once more to the guy with the tickets. Since I pre-bought my ticket ahead of time, my name was on the list and I was inside within a minute. Inside is intimate and cozy and the acoustics were really good. Behind the stage area, there's a place with some tables where the bands were selling merchandise.Bartenders were really friendly and I especially appreciated that they held my bag for me behind the bar. For free! Bar is cash only. There's plenty of street parking nearby but I chose to Lyft there and back. Would definitely come back!",5

Bottom of the Hill,Jeremy S.,"San Francisco, CA","Oct 21, 2016","I rented the space a while ago for a private event. Their rates were fair and everything went really smoothly. It was a rock show so we had to rent a bunch of equipment from another local vendor who dropped everything off before our arrival. No issues with the handoff and we had everything we expected. The sound engineer was on top of his game and knew what he was doing, no hiccups throughout the night. The space is pretty flexible, enough for a small show (maybe 80-90 people fit comfortably in front of the stage) but plenty of overflow room towards the back if you really want to pack the house. In addition to the bar you can get a few food items from their small kitchen, not sure if our guests took advantage but it was a nice option. We'll be back!",5
Bottom of the Hill,Lindsay G.,"Mill Valley, CA","Oct 21, 2016","Nice little intimate venue for watching live music. They serve food in addition to drinks so you can grab a bite here before the show.

Bottom of the Hill,Glenn P.,"Stockton, CA","Aug 30, 2016","I think you really have to think twice about coming to this place to see a concert. The auto break-ins are a serious problem and you're simply at a much greater risk for being vandalized at this venue compared to other venues in the Bay Area.  The venue hasn't exactly ignored the problem, and offers to check your bags, etc., but they're also not really pro-active about taking some sort of more concerted effort to protect their patrons. It's a tricky situation for them for sure, but given the extraordinary circumstances of the neighborhood it would seem to be in their best interest to try *something* besides a simple sign posted in the window warning you about the problem.However, once inside, the venue is homey and a good place to see small indie bands. The cash bar is totally a thing.",2
Bottom of the Hill,Danny B.,"Weston, CT","Jul 21, 2016","Already has a great reputation, and rightfully so. One of the only venues that allows all ages show in San Francisco. Hosts some of my favorite bigger, and smaller acts. Keep this place going, too many musicians need you !",5

Bottom of the Hill,Nancy N.,"Charlotte, NC","Feb 7, 2016","My husband and I drove in from Sacramento last night to see The Loved Ones here. It's Super Bowl weekend, and we had no trouble finding nearby free parking. Seriously, the commute from Sac to this venue couldn't be more ideal. We didn't have to deal with downtown traffic at all. The venue itself is small with a fun, funky vibe. I think capacity is under 300, so it was truly an intimate concert experience. There were some technical sound issues between the opening bands which put things behind a bit, but I thought Bottom of the Hill did a great job trouble shooting and getting them resolved asap. I also really appreciated on a personal note that the bar tender was extremely pleasant about giving me free water on multiple occasions as I was not ordering drinks. Overall this was a great concert experience... Dare I say likely more fantastical than what the goers of the Metallica show down the road experienced? I would definitely not hesitate to go see another concert here.",5
Bottom of the Hill,fatt m.,"Petaluma, CA","Feb 7, 2016",This venue hosted an awesome show and after it I went to my car to leave and my car was broke into.  I went and asked the staff how they usually handle stuff like that.  They were beyond nice to me and were so apologetic and sent one of their employees and one of the managers up to my car and helped clean up the glass from my car and helped tape up the window!  Such great people there.  They didn't have to do any of that!  Plus their venue rules...  Thank you to everyone who assisted me tonight.,5
Bottom of the Hill,Annie N.,"San Jose, CA","Jan 16, 2016","Bottom of the Hill is a great intimate music spot. When I say intimate, it indicates that it's a smaller crowd because it's not a huge place.If you know you possibly have super funny dance moves you might bust out with after you get some drinks in you, just know that everyone is going to be watching you hahaha (fine by me, I find it entertaining) You know the dance moves where you wonder if they have any sense of rhythm at all and question why they're throwing their arms everywhere in air as if their arms are jello lolThe night we came, a hip-hop Swedish band was playing and although I didn't understand anything the whole night, I still managed to have a good time! I wish I was on my date's level of tipsy, but had to call the uber and end the night early. I would love to return to bottom of the hill, but preferably with one of my girl friends haha :)",4
Bottom of the Hill,Patrick S.,"Lafayette, CA","Dec 4, 2015","BOTH does weddings! My wife and i have seen many a show here and love the colorful nightclub and took a chance to book a private event, our wedding. It may be a bit of an unconventional venue but Lynn and her staff are all stars: flexible, professional, and helpful. BOTH is the real san francisco with character and community. Go there to see a show, have a private event, and give them a nice tip. We could not be happier with how they made our rock and roll wedding dreams come true.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Nick V.,"Citrus Heights, CA","Nov 16, 2015","One of my more favorite venues in SF. It's kinda famous and it is easy to see why.I've seen plenty of bands here. It's so small and usually I hate small places that get too packed, but because of how 'shallow' the standing area is, I'm usually able to actually WATCH the bands that are playing, even when another 6'3"" BRO SHOULDER takes up that last cubic foot of space I had in front of me.I come here for the bands and don't think I've ever gotten a drink here, but other people appear to have them all the time.The one thing I dread about commuting to SF (from Sacramento) for some live music is the whole 'find a place to park your car' thing. Suffice to say, there's a generous residential area where I've been able to find parking pretty much every time with little to no drama, even with sold out shows. It's pretty much always in-out with this area which is good news if you're coming into the city. Just be prepared for the never-ending construction on the Bay Bridge on your way out. Bottom Of The Hill typically ends their shows around 1AM (I think they ended one ONCE at like 12:30 when I was there). If you can deal with that, you're golden.Just don't leave anything valuable anywhere visible in your car.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Patrick S.,"Seattle, WA","Nov 12, 2015","This place has achieved legend-status for a reason. Every worthwhile act has gone through Bottom of the Hill at some point in their careers. From Arcade Fire to Mike Park to True Widow, if you are on the way up, chances are you're going to play here when you come through San Francisco.It's a dive. And that's a major part of the venue's charm. It's also tiny, but that just means there isn't a bad view in the house. If you're feeling crowded you can step out to the back patio and still be able to hear and see the show through the window. Oh yeah, and bring cash. That part is important. You gotta bring cash.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Priya P.,"Los Angeles, CA","Oct 19, 2015","This is my FAVORITE venue. Period. I have been visiting this venue for nearly 9 years now (still do even though I live in Sacramento now) and I'm sorry it has taken me so long to write this review guys! This place hosts an array of artists both big and small, which is honestly a treat, like an ice cream dipped in chocolate and then dipped in more chocolate kind of treat. The place is big enough to pull in a crowd, but small enough to feel intimate. You can actually see the band perform from almost every angle and feel like you're a part of something. BOTH stays down to earth by making shows accessible to all ages and keeping ticket prices reasonable. The people are usually awesome whether it be the crowd or the people that work there because we're always there for the same thing. THE MUSIC. The acoustics are solid, which is probably the most important thing. If you can't hear the music or if it isn't fine-tuned, then what's the point, am I right? It does have a dive bar-esque feel, but it's definitely open and clean and has a cute little patio in the back to breathe. First tip: bring CASH if you want to drink. Second tip: Be prepared to be awkwardly intimate with people in the bathroom. It's usually clean, but they fit 2 stalls and a sink in what I feel could be a bedroom closet. I just wanted to say that this place makes me happy and I hope you get a chance to check it out for yourself :)",5
Bottom of the Hill,Evan K.,"Niagara Falls, NY","Oct 10, 2015","The Appearance:While the outside of the venue may not have the greatest curb appeal, the inside certainly packs a punch. The main floor is decorated with vibrant posters for upcoming shows and calendars displaying the rich history of bands that stepped foot on stage. The dim lighting almost gives the vibe of a jazzy night club you would see in the movies. Just beyond the stage is a nook for bands to put their merch on display and get in touch with the fans. Outside the double doors is a patio to get fresh air or have a cig. The patio has some size to it, but if it is a sold out show the patio can become quickly congested. Especially in between bands when everyone is sweated up from moving around on the main floor. The Bar:The bar is fairly proportioned to the size of the venue. The staff is very friendly and seems to enjoy what they do. Service is very quick and drink prices seem to be below average for the San Francisco area. The Experience:The size of the main floor is absolutely perfect. It is big enough to pack in a sizable crowd, but small enough to provide an intimate musical experience. Anywhere you stand seems to provide a great view. You wont have to worry about a pole or crazy fixture blocking your vision. The sound is always crisp and never overpowering (something that may occur in a tight venue). I cannot recall an instance where the volume was too loud. The area closest to the stage tends to be a place for those who want to dance/ skank/ rage (depending on the music). It allows those who want a place to move around some room, while providing those who don't, space to watch comfortably. There may be moments things get tight, but overall it is a very chill venue to see a show.For Bands:The first major drawback is the lack of storage space for instrument cases. The majority of them needed to be stacked against the wall near the merch area. Not that anyone would ever mess around with your stuff, but these days you never really know. Members do receive a free drink which helps to get the night started. The sound guy is extremely professional and takes the time to do the job right. This includes taping down cords, adjusting mics, and other minor details some venues over look. The sound guy proactively adjusts the levels to ensure your sound is the very best. This is a venue that takes shows very seriously. The payoff is always a great time with plenty of memories. The Verdict:Highly recommend you give this venue a shot, whether you are an artist or an audience member. Can't wait to play my next show there. June 2016 cannot come soon enough!",5

Bottom of the Hill,Sharon R.,"Rockville, MD","Sep 29, 2015","My type of venue: it's large enough to have some ish bigger names (I saw Kevin Devine, Dads and Rozwell Kid), but small enough to make it intimate.  It has a slight dive bar feel, and be warned...cash only. At the same time it feels clean (i.e sticky floors don't particularly stand out when I think about the place). There's the patio for smokers that doubles as a bit of a greet and meet spot. The whole atmosphere around the venue is so relaxed.I also like the corridor to the right of the stage where the merchandise stand is with the comfy benches and tables. Shows are usually late and I work really early on weekdays...sometimes having a place to plop down for a sec can be so important.",4

Bottom of the Hill,Colby D.,"San Diego, CA","Jul 10, 2015","Very cute and intimate. Nicely decorated. Pretty lax organization, except for the ""No stage diving"" and ""No crowd surfing"" signs. Wasn't going to do that anyway, so I wasn't bothered. I mostly loved the intimacy of the venue, but I was most bothered by the crowd!! Ugh I don't know if it is usually the same age demographic, but there were so many older people (50s+) present. I wouldn't have minded, as I am all about music appreciation at all ages, but it was so INCREDIBLY annoying that no one seemed to know how to turn off their flash? And they all kept taking pictures...and no one who worked there was stopping people? What about the poor performers?!?",4

Bottom of the Hill,Ee Vonn Y.,"San Jose, CA","Jun 3, 2015","Bottom of the Hill is a nice, small venue near Whole Foods and Live Sushi, which makes plans for any date night extremely simple. Grab some dinner at either location, then head over to this bar for good music in a relaxing setting.We came here on for the 10th anniversary of Mae's Everglow tour. The bar is cash only but there is an ATM machine. The layout of the bar incorporated a bunch of themes that somehow works when all thrown together--i.e. Christmas lights, skulls on the wall, and potted plants. It makes you feel like you've found an intimate, cozy hipster bar that was too hipster to judge you because you discovered their new hangout spot.There are tables in the back where people had their Macbooks set up. The window treatment is also interesting, reminding me of a house straight from a Dr. Seuss book. The patio area is relaxing as well. There is a staircase but it leads to storage space. No one seems to know that so occasionally you'll see people walking upstairs, thinking they're heading to a cool spot. But then they just come back in a few minutes because there's nothing there.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Cindee T.,"San Mateo, CA","May 12, 2015","First time visiting bottom at the hill. Was there to check out a band, Sick of Sarah, who were performing for the night. A small and cosy venue space ideal for smaller bands. The bar only accepts cash, likewise cash payment for the entry fee if any. They do have an ATM just next to the entrance if you didnt carry cash.Though the place appear kind of old and rundown, the sound system was good. The bar carries the typical alcoholic drink and a limited list of beers. Drinks are cheap, beers were at $6/bottle. Tried to request for Mojito but they do not have any mint. So ended up with two Strongbow cider which worked out well too. Two girls next to us ask for their ""special shots"" listed on the wall, the bartender whispered to them that he got no clue what it was. Thought it was pretty hilarious, apparently he was just stepping in before the real bartender comes in. The streets were pretty dark by the time we got there, it appears to be located in the midst of an industrial area. Ideal for a music venue so there wouldn't have much sound/music limit restrictions. There are plenty of parking along the streets so that's great for those who drive. It's also a short distant from the 22nd Caltrain.",4

Bottom of the Hill,Sean H.,"San Ramon, CA","Nov 18, 2014","To put it simply, Bottom of the Hill is a dive bar with a stage. It's small and charming, stuck in a random spot in the city, and if not for the huge blue sign they've got blazing up the front of the building, it'd be nearly forgotten. But, it's my favorite music venue in the city because of the intimacy you get with being so close to the musicians, and with the great sound they have here.Just to show my concert cred, I've been here for Seeking Empire twice, Asobi Seksu, and the Colourist. Every band I've seen here has been incredible, and I've been literally footsteps away from them performing. It is the best sounding venue I've been to in the city. Everything just feels crisp, and loud as well. Feel like I need ear plugs sometimes when I'm here, but that's a good thing right?The venue itself is small, but not small enough to feel claustrophobic. They've also got a nice little patio right behind the stage that you can go out and grab some fresh air or a smoke. Their bar is pretty stocked, and they've got all your typical favorite beers on tap. It's rare that a venue will sway me into going to a concert, but Bottom of the Hill has that unique effect on me! Definitely make it a point to grab a show here sometime.",5

If I can remember off the top of my head, Pabst was $4.50 and generally beers were $5. Mixed drinks were around $7/$8, I think. Sound wasn't bad at all. I really liked being able to be close to the performances. Bathrooms are VERY small. For girls, two small stalls and literally only 1 person can be at the sink.

Bottom of the Hill,Brian M.,"Menlo Park, CA","Jul 23, 2014","Went to this club for the first time the other night to see The Chain Gang of 1974 (Awesome show!). The minute I saw this club I knew I'd like it. It's really tiny, probably the smallest one I've been to in SF. It's in a seedy looking neighborhood, but that just lends to the charm (and the upside is that there's plenty of street parking). Inside, it is exactly how a rock and roll club should look. Lots of cool lighting and posters all over the place, and the acoustics are excellent. The front part of the club is the main floor, stage, and bar, and there's a nice little lounge with a fireplace in back and a Patio just outside the lounge for smoking. Some reviews said there were no ins and outs, but when I asked if I could go put something in the car they had no problem with it. The staff was great, and when I requested some reserve seating at the bar because my wife is on crutches and can't stand for long periods of time, they were very helpful and accommodating (Thanks Lynn for hooking us up!).The bar is cash only, but not terribly expensive at all. The Liquor assortment is pretty standard and there are no specialty cocktails, but the ladies behind the bar were willing to make anything I requested as long as they had the ingredients on hand to make it. The place is so small that band members can be found hanging out before and after their set, so I got to meet Kam from Chain Gang (super cool dude), and it was just a very chill, laid back place. I think my only complaint was that they opened kind of late (doors 8:30, first band at 9:00), so with 3 bands playing and a cutoff at midnight, it felt kind of rushed. I would have liked to have gotten a longer set out of Chain Gang, but they did awesome with the hour (barely) that they had. I think if they had just opened an hour earlier it would have been perfect. Some people also said in their reviews that the bands played way too loud, but I didn't think the noise levels were excessive. All 3 bands sounded good, but none of them were painfully loud, but always a good idea to bring some earplugs anyway. All in all, had a great night and looking forward to going back!",5

Lots of outdoor parking around the area, my fiance' loves that about this venue, making it his favorite SF music venue for small concerts.Be sure to bring some ear plugs, they like to rock out the speakers here.  Which is cool, because you can feel the music through your body, however, your hearing is replaceable.  Felt like the crowd is pretty chill.  Oh and bonus, along the sides there are seats if you're luck enough to grab one.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Emmanuella Z.,"New York, NY","Jun 26, 2014","I go to a lot of concerts, and been to a lot of venues. Let me tell you this, Bottom of the Hill is one of the best concert venues in all of San Francisco. Located at the bottom of Potrero Hill (hence the name), Bottom of the Hill is up there with Rickshaw Stop. Staff is friendly, sound is always great. I've never been disappointed with this venue. The sound quality here is always A+. They put their all into giving the crowd, and band a great experience.Love the outdoor courtyard/smoking area. Decor is great, and always a friendly vibe no matter what genre of music you came here for. I've been backstage here with my friends who were headlining a few months ago, and it was pretty cool. The backstage area is up the stairs located in the courtyard. Good security/bouncers, good drinks, okay food.I highly recommend coming to Bottom of the Hill if in the area, and catch a show. It never fails, and It's nothing like The Chapel (horrible, pretentious venue).",5
Bottom of the Hill,Diogo T.,"Kirkland, WA","Jun 22, 2014","Amazing bands, but WAY TOO LOUD (even for a metal guitarist).Look, I am a big rock bar fan and I am used to listen to loud music (I am actually a guitarist of a metal band). But that place was at a level that was hard to stand, even for me. I had planned to stay all night, but I left early due to the excess volumeOther than that, it is worth the visit. Bathrooms are clean, beers are fairly priced, and I only paid $10 for cover. One more thing, for the purists, they played HARDCORE, not ROCK.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Adrienne G.,"San Francisco, CA","Jun 18, 2014",First discovered Bottom Of The Hill when seeing PETER MURPHY & was really impressed w/ this venue.Small & intimate & reminded me of a Red Devil Lounge or Cafe Du Nord ( before both closed ).  There's a small stage & everyone piles up wherever there's a little space to stand.  But makes seeing such great artists in these venues all the richer in experience & worth the attendanceParking was easy to come by & bartenders were easy to recognize we needed refills - thanks for the imbibing attention!Just missed seeing the Proclaimers but am definitely keeping my eyes out for the next chance to come back to Bottom of the Hill!,4

Bottom of the Hill,Jaina D.,"San Francisco, CA","May 1, 2014","I actually don't like going to bars, nightclubs and other evening entertainment spots-- but I LOVE Bottom Of The Hill. Big enough to book some rather notable acts, yet small enough to have that intimate feel. The sound quality is always excellent. I will add that I've been on both sides of the stage, as performer and as an audience member, and it's been a good time any which way. The staff are friendly and the drinks are strong. I am way more inclined to see a show if it's at BOTH than just about anywhere else in the city.",5

Bottom of the Hill,Nadeem A.,"Fremont, CA","Apr 5, 2014","I've been to Bottom of the Hill a couple times, once when my band was performing and once when my friend's band was performing.When I played, the sound guy was professional, but not very friendly.  Luckily the rest of our experience was great - we had an awesome turnout, played with cool bands, had good sound on stage, and we played pretty well.When I went to watch my friend play, I brought my DSLR to shoot video footage.  The sound engineer, Paul Thomas, was fantastic!  He gave me a line out of the sound board and a line from a room mic, so I could get some good audio.  The sound in the room was awesome, and my friends say the sound on stage was top notch as well.The overall experience was 4 stars, but Paul Thomas pushes the review up to a 5. He was knowledgable, professional, friendly, and he went out of his way to make sure the night was as good as possible.",5

Bottom of the Hill,Amber D.,"Brooklyn, NY","Mar 30, 2014","Great venue, the only qualm I have is it's location-17th and Missouri really leaves you stranded in the industrial part of the mission after a show.  Be sure to bring a jacket or have a Lyft coming to get you so that you're not roundhouse kicking everyone else out of the way for flippant taxi drivers who accidentally wander out that far.  Other than that, over-priced drinks (as expected with any venue), cool patio in the back to smoke in (and you can still see the back of the stage and hear the music), and a bunch of creepy old masks and seemingly ceramic heads that line the top of the bar- you aren't tripping they're actually truly there.  Just an old, funky spot that is really quite intimate to see a performance at.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Emily G.,"Santa Clarita, CA","Mar 26, 2014","A visiting friend wanted to see a show, any show in town so I randomly picked this place as it was cheap and I had heard it was a pretty cool place. And boy was everyone and my random brain right about this place!It is a bar/restaurant, and they do all ages and 21+ shows. My friend being of that annoying almost-but-not-quite-yet age, we went to an all ages show and it was surprisingly not overpopulated with teenagers. They've got a front room with the bar itself and a few tables and chairs which widens out to the low stage, where you as the audience can get up close and personal with the artists if you so choose. Bathrooms are just past the kitchen (a long window in which you order their decent sized food menu from) and as the night goes on, get grosser and smellier. Following the stinky bathroom corridor is another room with more chairs, tables, a fireplace (not lit during my visit), and doors leading to their outdoor patio for smokers or lovers of the fresh air, which also has some seating. I enjoyed going to the back room and relaxing but still enjoying the music.This place is cash only, bar and food, and while they do have an ATM it charges you $2.95 for each withdrawal so I recommend bringing some cash along.Drinks are pretty average, slightly overpriced bar drinks. My first drink was kinda yuck (but that is more my taste, I decided to try a new drink and it had ginger beer in it and apparently I do not like ginger beer) and my second drink (that I knew I liked) was good, but crazy strong, I couldn't finish it because I wanted to be able to drive home later. I got a quesadilla to sober up and it was perhaps the best quesadilla I've ever had. But I was drunk, so everything probably tasted delicious.The bands: I saw Young the Moon, The Districts, Big Tree, and Guy Fox. All some pretty bomb dignity indie bands whom I greatly enjoyed. All of the bands mingled with the crowds before and after their set, so it was great to be able to interact with them and tell them how much we loved their tunes. This place seems to book a lot of local bands, and in my book that is always good to support. Definitely come back here again for a good time, for bands I know and will get to know!",5
Bottom of the Hill,Halsey B.,"Seattle, WA","Mar 18, 2014","Love this place, super intimate and they get some pretty impressive acts here, also great up and coming bands or indie legends. The sound is super loud, I always wear earplugs, other than that, shows are on average $12, there isn't really a bad place to stand since it's so small, drinks are cheap. I use to come here when I was under 21, I still think they offer shows for all ages, I've never experienced a bad crowd as far as I can remember, again I think this is due to it being a smaller venue - feels almost like an awesome house party..... trekking it out to Potrero though is a trek! There aren't cabs readily available and the muni doesn't run very frequently by the time you're out but if you work your app magic this isn't a big problem.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Rachel L.,"San Francisco, CA","Mar 18, 2014","I have to be honest,I don't like it. There is literally not a chair to sit on, god forbid you want to order food and the crowd looks like a bus broke down outside and people just wandered in to get a drink until their bus was fixed. This crowd just stands there like cattle, no matter how many times I've been there it's the same. I'm done.",2
Bottom of the Hill,Gina A.,"Pittsburg, CA","Feb 18, 2014",I've seen a few bands here and have always had a great time.  Great place to meet up with friends and grab a few drinks.

Bottom of the Hill,Ken A.,"San Jose, CA","Feb 17, 2014",chill spot. good shows. cheap shows. 16+ for some reason but what ever. good and bad shows here. good range of different music genre/scenes. outdoor smoking area is chronic. good selections of beer. cheap local brewed beers. been multiple times. good experience all times. sketch area but love the cuttyness of it. gets hot and sweaty and shit. shut up and vibe.,5

When I found out, I got tickets right away! Perfect excuse to check this venue out.I love the size of this venue. It's perfect. It's on the small/medium side, which is intimate enough.

Bottom of the Hill,Duckee D.,"San Francisco, CA","Jan 2, 2014","Garbage.I will never patronize this dump again.Went on a Friday night to see a friend's band.  Great show.As 1am neared (not 2am, as they list their hours onYelp! AND their website shows), an announcement was made that they were closing.  My two friends went to the restroom, and N and I waited for them where we had all been standing.  When they started ushering people out, I was going to find them to tell them we needed to get going, and one of the waitresses (older, scraggly blonde, hat) condescendingly said, ""oh, you need to move this way, sweetie ... "" pushing me to the exit.  I told her I was looking for two friends I had been waiting for, to which she responded, ""oh, okay, well ... I guarantee they'll get out, so you need to go this way,"" and proceeded to try to push us out the door.  RUDE. One friend came out of the restroom (I also had her wristlet which she inadvertently left on the counter - probably because she thought we'd be there waiting for her), and she wanted to wait for our last friend in the restroom (her GF).  Same scraggly haired lady emerged from the kitchen and tried to tell her, ""Yeah, you need to move THIS way, Sweetie,"" to which my friend replied, ""Well, my girlfriend's in the bathroom and I'm going to wait until she gets out!""  Scraggles, shocked, says, ""WELL, I guess you just made a statement!"" and went off somewhere else.After a cover charge and *hours* of drinks, these people act like complete idiotic jerks to their patrons.  I will NEVER come here again and will also be sure to tell everyone I know not to patronize this place.  Don't believe the hype - the people that run this place really shouldn't be rewarded for their abhorrent ""customer service"".",1

Drinks are average priced: I paid about $6.50 for a whiskey+coke and $5.50 for a Blue Moon. Overall, I liked the location since its not around too many bars so it doesn't get overly crowded, and they always have cool acts playing every night. 4 stars.",4

The sound tech is also very good at what he does. Throughout the bands sets you could hear the slight adjustments being made which made for an excellent audio/visual experience.

Bottom of the Hill,Jenn Y.,"Albany, CA","May 16, 2013","So I'm not much a music fan and other patrons probably hate me because I fall asleep during the show if my partner has dragged me there on a weeknight. But this place is great because for one low entry price of $10-20, you get to chill at a pretty cool bar, listen to some good (I think?) music, and be part of a VERY enthusiastic crowd.Logistics: Parking is easy and beer is plentiful. The crowd is young and cool and way hip, so you get to feel younger by proxy. There are like 5 chairs total in the whole place, but if you are geriatrically inclined like me, you could easily grab one because all the cool young urbanite indie lovers are standing to watch the show. It's kind of a culture shock for me to see a room full of people strictly on their feet, standing still or slightly bobbing their heads to the music.",5

I just saw Third Eye Blind there and could not have been more than 6 feet from Stephen Jenkins.  The tickets were also very cheap, though they go fast.  Nicely located in Potrero where street parking isn't a problem.  They also serve drinks in glass, which is definitely rare in a music venue.

Bottom of the Hill,Matthew G.,"Saint Helena, CA","Feb 24, 2013","One of my two favorite music venues in SF (the other being Cafe du Nord); I always dig the smallish/medium-sized spaces where you are close enough to feel intimate with the band and music (and music-lovers) but still enough space not to feel like a sardine.That's what this place is like. They have some extra ""breathing room"" in the back with plenty of seating to eat, drink, or have a chat -- you can still hear the music, but can't see the stage from there.  They also have a little outside patio -- popular with the smokers, so I don't use it much, but it's nice that it's there.My favorite things about this place are the kitschy 60's B-movie/beatnik vibe (hard to describe... sort of a Lost in Space meets Kerouac meets Beetlejuice kind of decor), the offering of local and indie/underground bands (sometimes very popular in their own right, though -- Black Moth Super Rainbow and School of Seven Bells, for example), and the low prices (tix about $8-15 usually -- no crazy Ticketmaster style ""service fees"" for advanced purchase, just a couple bucks extra), with reasonable drinks but cash-only bar. I like perusing their calendar and in any given month I can always find a new up-and-coming or under-the-radar band I dig. (The most recent ones being United Ghosts and Foxtail Somersault)Oh yeah, and I drive into the city regardless of where I go, so easy-breezy parking right outside the front door is a major bonus in my book.",5

Awesome surround system and great, catchy live music!  Grab some drinks, enjoy the music and you're good to go!  Head to the front, where the stage is at only if you want to dance or bob your head and body with the music!The vocalists there can surely reach a range of high notes, guitarists can strum those strings and drummers surely hit those beats!I'm surprised that they let under 21 year olds enter this place considering that they serve drinks at the bar!

So when my friend asked if I wanted to go see Alt-J and tickets were only 2.10 ($1.05 + 1.05 service fee) I totally jumped at the opportunity and so glad I did.The place is small and intimate and theres definitely a line to get in. And since alt-J was pretty popular, definitely had more people than expected. But basically heres the run down.1.) Alt-J and Wildcat! Wildcat! were both good and really enjoyed it.2.) The place was not extremely huge and they definitely dont pack it in beyond capacity. Much appreciated.3.) Got a great view of the band and could hear everything.4.) Apparently theres food, but only got beer. Given the crowd of the night, kinda crazy to try and get food.Definitely 5 stars in my book and thinking about checking out some random bands.

Great music and it sounded great at the venue.  I like the feel of the bar and how it's decorated, but I'm not too fond of the bartender I had.  Perhaps she was having a tough day or something, but she wasn't very friendly and kinda just shoved the drink at me.  I still made sure to tip her, but her attitude didn't really change the next time I came back to get more drinks.  Weird.One thing I love about this place is they have food.  It makes things super convenient--you don't have to go elsewhere to find yourself a drinking snack.  Make sure you have cash though!  This place doesn't accept credit cards, and the ATM has a surcharge of $2.35 or something to withdrawal money.Lastly, I'm not sure if it's the neighborhood or the people I met were just unlucky, but a poor family came out after the show to find that their SUV had been broken into.  On a general note, make sure to not leave any bags visible in your car or someone might want to steal it, thinking that there's something valuable in it.",3
Bottom of the Hill,Amy C.,"San Francisco, CA","Nov 14, 2012","Great place for small indie band shows! Crowd size is manageable to maneuver around and still easy to talk to friends during the show.

Inside, they have good beer for cheap-ish prices, an easy-going bar tender, GREAT acoustics, and pretty cool under-the-radar bands. We saw Cold Eskimo (who KILLED IT - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kqFB_ssjBk). It was packed, but enough room to still step back, get yourself another beer, chat with the bands . . .

Bottom of the Hill,Alex S.,"Brooklyn, NY","Jun 25, 2012","Though located next to nothing, this retro styled venue is a find, and a great one at that.The exterior looks like someone's house and the inside looks like the members of the B-52's exploded all over the walls.

A well organized space with a really cool back patio as well.The food wasn't half bad either. I ate the thai noodle curry stir fry whatever with chicken and it wasn't bad. It seemed like that dish anywhere else would exclude the noodles in the curry but whatever - it tasted fine.Clearly this isn't a place you'd just wander in (unless you were either in the area or on an expansive, walkabout-esque bender) so you're going to go here because the band you want to see is playing here - BUT if there's ever a moment where you're not sure it's worth the trek, definitely check this place out.

Bottom of the Hill,Margaret I.,"San Francisco, CA","Jun 3, 2012","I experienced Bottom of the Hill for the first time just recently where I got to see (shameless plug) Anaura http://www.anaura.com/It was a pretty awesome venue.  It's small but not too small.  (For reference I feel like the Make Out Room is too small for a concert.)  Acoustics were good, drinks were reasonable and the bar tender was super nice.  While it's not really in my neighborhood I didn't mind going out of my way.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Melinda F.,"Winnetka, Los Angeles, CA","May 30, 2012","Cool little dive bar that I found while visiting the city. I actaully went to see a badn called ""Coast Jumpers"". I liked the place, the neighborhood was a little sketchy considering a building alram was going off as I was waiting for the bus for this place :/ but drinks are a great price and I would come back when ever I come back to the city again.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Sophie C.,"Oakland, CA","May 25, 2012","I'll be honest, only been here once. It was to see God Is An Astronaut. Enough said.It was completely packed, I had to stay near the back because I was zoning pretty hard. Otherwise, nice enough guys who work here. Full bar, clean enough restrooms. Area in the back where you can eat and chillout. In a random spot in the city, but that's the charm. Decent sound system. I'm excited to see more shows here. Good for all sorts of shows, but preferably those of the rock and metal influence. Nice to see they throw a lot of shows for local music.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Karsyn M.,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA","May 22, 2012","LOVE LOVE LOVE Bottom of the Hill!  It's my favorite little place to see bands in SF!  I've been here dozens of times, seen some great bands!  It's such an intimate venue and the decor is really cool.  Drinks are reasonably priced, tickets to get in are always a steal!  They even have some really great well known bands play like Reggie And The Full Effect and Alkaline Trio!  I haven't ever eaten here but everything else is amazing!",5
Bottom of the Hill,Frances R.,"San Jose, CA","Apr 30, 2012","This is absolutely one of the BEST venues in the city, hands down. Definitely love how I can enjoy a drink or two while watching a few great bands playing five feet away from me. Go there, now!",5
Bottom of the Hill,Michael L.,"Taipei, Taiwan","Apr 30, 2012","Bottom of the Hill? More like ""Bottom of the Barrel when it comes to San Francisco Concert Venues"". The place is small (smaller than Slim's/bigger indoor area than Thee Parkside but a way shittier set-up), looks like a crack shack, shitty bathrooms, and the drinks are meh. Yes, I sound like a negative Nancy. Deal with it, noob. I just think this place is overrated.",3
Bottom of the Hill,Steven R.,"Chicago, IL","Apr 26, 2012","Man I love Bottom of the Hill.This is likely the most excellent eardrum busting music venue in the city.  The spaces are small but seeing the band a few feet from you is priceless.  In some ways this place makes me laugh because it seems like that dump from an 80's movie where some band plays only to have the scene end in mayhem with it getting trashed.  The bathrooms are pretty nasty but easy to get to.  There's a neat smoking patio if that is your thing and a back ""chill"" area though mostly this is where bands hock merch.  The bar offers nothing fancy in terms of beer but thankfully keeps it decent at $4-5 a pint.Probably the only bad part is that this is a relative ""dead zone"" when it comes to cabs and unless you bail early, you'll be fighting your fellow music watchers for a precious ride home.  It's ok, just tell your self the Mission really isn't that far, start walking and reward yourself with a stiff drink when you get there.",4
Bottom of the Hill,sam S.,"San Francisco, CA","Apr 19, 2012","there's many reasons why Bottom of the Hill is consistently voted best venue in the city. love the patio and kitchen. Just great spot to catch a show, I try to make it out here as often as I can.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Gabrielle L.,"San Francisco, CA","Apr 15, 2012","BotH is a really unique venue.  It's in the middle of a dark quiet area of Portrero Hill, and until you see the bright neon sign you might think you turned down the wrong block.  There is usually easy parking in this neighborhood, which is an added bonus.  The place itself is usually pretty cold and dark, but they have a nice back lounge area with a fireplace and a bench.  There's also a back patio which is great because it has a high window from the back of the stage.  You can hear the muffled sound and usually see the drummer a little bit.  The bathrooms could use some work, but it's not surprising compared to the place.  They also serve food here which is great because there's nothing around.  I've never ordered from there, but the menu sounds pretty good for bar food.  They showcase a lot of local talent (and some un-talent), which always makes for a good time.  At the last concert I went to, the sound guys seemed to be having a hard time getting the band's monitors right, and the mic even shocked one of the singers.  It came across that we probably weren't getting the ideal sound setup, and I wondered if that's par for the hill.I will always enjoy coming to this place every so often for a fun night out!",4
Bottom of the Hill,Karen D.,"San Francisco, CA","Apr 9, 2012","Came here on Friday night with co-workers to watch another co-worker's band play as part of a lineup. Hated having to get off the 22 and walk two blocks in the dark in an otherwise deserted part of Potrero Hill (And calling up the bro for a ride back home), but had a pretty wild and fun time all-around!If there's one good thing about this venue being surrounded by not much else, it's the fact that the incredible loudness it produces can't bother neighboring residents and businesses. The acoustics are amazing! The interior of the place is gorgeous and roomy, including a very swanky-looking stage. Our little group jumped around, headbanged, and made that dance floor our bitch. There's a good amount of bar stool seating and some booths and couches in the back to eat, drink, and converse and if you just want to listen to the music away from the main area - also a fireplace to warm up on those cool nights! The smoking area right next door to the booths provides even more liveliness, as if there wouldn't be enough magic going on inside.The staff is very friendly, and the bartenders make their drinks pretty strong. Or maybe that's just my lightweight talking! But they were definitely helpful in loosening me up for the evening. ;)Great crowd, great venue, great music! Gotta find an excuse to come back here for another rockin' time!",5

Bottom of the Hill,Dave B.,"Omaha, NE","Apr 7, 2012","Saw Bob Mould there recently.  Apparently, this is the only club in the SF area that I managed to forget.  I don't know how, either, as it's a cool joint!Opening with a bar to the right and a stage or DJ to the left (Mould was DJing at the time, which was equally cool), you have an open floor facing a stage on the left, and a hallway on the right leading back to an outdoor smoking area.  Nothing huge.  Great acoustics though.  If you're able to stand for a show, this is a good place to stand!",4
Bottom of the Hill,Gee M.,"Santa Rosa, CA","Mar 10, 2012","Visited this place to see Frank Turner. Good scene of music coming through here. The outside patio that sits outside is chill to get a breath of fresh air, er cigarette smoke. Place was fun, and the bar down the street is equally as good.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Blake B.,"San Francisco, CA","Mar 4, 2012","It's been years since I've been back to Bottom of the Hill but I used to come here all the time and I love this place.  It's such a small intimate venue but gets some great acts to perform here.  It's gritty than most other places in SF but in a good way.The beers are cheaper here, the sound a little more raw all while giving you a feeling like you're at home.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Dan P.,"San Francisco, CA","Feb 28, 2012","So far, one of my favorite music venues in the city.  Dark, intimate.  Nice patio area out back to chill out and smoke and stuff.  I like how it's a bit off the beaten path (easier parking).  Decently priced drinks here.  I haven't tried the food but the options look solid.  I don't like how they let 18 year olds in this place but that's not enough for me to dock it stars.  It's mostly indie bands that roll through and that's fine by me!",5
Bottom of the Hill,Amy W.,"Monterey, CA","Feb 17, 2012",I love Bottom Of The Hill! I have only attended a couple shows here but the atmosphere is one of a kind! The venue is located about a block away from a Whole Foods Market so you can get grub before the show or eat at the restaurant inside of the venue. It holds about 100 or so people and is a very intimate space.,5
Bottom of the Hill,Jennifer T.,"Oakland, CA","Feb 16, 2012","Came for the superbowl and was unprepared for the fact that I'd have to bring my own seat.  We didn't stay long, though the chili cookoff was interesting.  Drinks were a tad steep, but it was superbowl, a +, they did have jello shots, sooooo.I'll update my review if I every go to a show here.",2
Bottom of the Hill,Betim D.,"Palo Alto, CA","Feb 4, 2012","There are many things  I like about this place. If you like indie rock music, experimental or sometimes even electronic, or any non-mainstream music in general, this is the place for you. The ambience is chill, and the lighting is nice. There's a  cool patio outside if you want to  relax or have a conversation. You have to remember that the ambience is kind of random -- the bands who play really attract a specific kind of audience, but you will be surprised in a good way.Typically there's a cover of $8 - 15, but it also depends on the artists who are performing.  It doesn't get too busy, but again this all depends on the show.  Parking is usually not an issue.I highly recommend this place if you want to get a real taste of urban music scene, but of course it's very diverse as well.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Bridget B.,"San Francisco, CA","Dec 20, 2011","Really cool, intimate venue with awesome shows. It is definitely worth the trip out to portero for those not nearby.",4
Bottom of the Hill,P D.,"St Helena, CA","Dec 8, 2011","One word: hipsters. San Francisco if full of them so this should be expected but this place doesn't really have anything else to make up for it. Kind of small, not really in a good location. Boring.",2
Bottom of the Hill,Janice F.,"San Francisco, CA","Nov 2, 2011","Always loved this establishment.  This place was meant for the punk rock scene, but it'll rock to indie alternative too every now and then.  Enter this dark room, pay to the left, then grab a drink to the right.  Drinks are affordable, and main floor is pretty big.  This place, I always need to wear ear plugs.  Make sure to pay the bartender a buck to get some.  Lounging is in the back and the very back is the smoking area.  They have this stairway outside that goes up to the rooftop for additional partying, however, its exclusive so I have yet to venture up there.  Make sure to say hi to the local Bottom of the Hill kitty in the smoking area, and pray that he/she doesn't get lung cancer.  Street parking is readily available, and its away from the downtown madness, so its low key and ideal.  All in all, a great venue to check out up and coming artist, local bands and just to have a rocking time.  No doubt!",5
Bottom of the Hill,Loli L.,"San Francisco, CA","Sep 26, 2011","Cozy little spot that makes for great band-enjoying. Though I didn't see the point in getting a hand stamp in addition to the paper bracelet, the logic torment it caused was eased by the strongness of the drinks. Holy cow, did I get my money's worth! I had to stop enjoying my drinks after the second round and was grateful that they replenished the complimentary water as often as they did. The bathroom left much to be desired but it's not like I really go out of my way to watch bands in places with pristine bathrooms. The stall doors closed (sort of), there was plenty of TP, and the toilets flushed- so it was adequate. Overall, there is not really a bad view in the house so even if you're not into strong drinks or bathrooms, it makes for a nice spot to enjoy live music.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Anna L.,"Oakland, CA","Aug 29, 2011","Bottom of the Hill is probably my favorite venue EVER. It feels like home. Tons of the bands I'm friends with have played, as well as bands I don't personally know, and it's always a great show. things I love in particular:- the back patio. I had a photoshoot there. It's adorable and has a ton of different backgrounds. - the giant speakers on the floor in front of the stage. I like to sit on them :)- I don't need to deal with getting a photo pass.- the funky decor, especially all the random lamps. sure the bathrooms are tiny, but they're cute!overall, lots of good times here, so I guess I'm biased in favor of Bottom of the Hill.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Darrin D.,"CA, CA","Aug 29, 2011","Went to The Bottom of The Hill last night just for a night cap and stayed till closing time!!!

Bottom of the Hill,Holden P.,"San Francisco, CA","Aug 27, 2011","The only thing that stinks about this venue is that you're nearly dependent on friends with cars or a a cab to get there. The 19 goes by, but only about once a decade.That said...WOW I LOVE Bottom of the Hill.They showcase bands like a master curator shows the Met. It's a tiny space, but so many wonderful local and non-local, big and not-so-big bands have played there, some bands are terrible and some are mind-blowing wowness. I like places with history.It's cozy and yes, the patio smoking section is so much nicer than the street. You can have conversations! You can make friends! Then, when you go back in, you can shut up and enjoy the music! Awesome, right?Also, the green room is like a club house so I'm happy when the Hub's band plays here.I have not enjoyed the food, but the bartenders are sweethearts, all.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Brian S.,"North Wales, PA","Aug 10, 2011","A great independent music venue.Good sound and ample space to move around (unless you're in the men's room).If you go, spend some time looking at the walls and see what great acts have played there over the years.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Stephanie H.,"San Francisco, CA","Aug 3, 2011","As a San Francisco native, I'm little embarrassed I had never heard of this venue until my friend just took me to a show here. What an awesome place! It was surprisingly quick and easy to get to by bus, though it's all the way across town from me (so chances are I'll definitely be coming back soon!). The place is small, though bigger than other venues I've been to in the city. It has a nice little back area with booths too where you can't hear the band as well, but it's quieter and you can sit if you want to (but who goes to shows to sit?). The beer was decently priced, friendly bartenders/bouncers. All in all, a great night out with friends. I'll be back, for sure.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Karena Q.,"San Francisco, CA","Jul 30, 2011","Came here on Thursday to check out a friend's band and LOVED the back patio. Quiet, a fair amount of seating and super laid back vibe. We hung out there for awhile and when we finally went back inside, the place was packed (not shoulder to shoulder packed, but more so than when we arrived)! We still had plenty of room to hang out by the bar (which is cash only) and enjoy the show.",4

Bottom of the Hill,Ken L.,"Dublin, CA","Jun 1, 2011","Oh, Bottom of The Hill, you've found your way to, and I love you from, the bottom of my heart. How have I not been here before?Staff that does NOT scowl at you with the ""I'm too cool, cause I'm selling you, tickets/alcohol, at this fucking venue, even though I'm not in the band!!!"" when getting tickets or booze. Thank you! And thank you again.I saw Asobi Seksu here the other, uh, afternoon, yeah, early show. They were great, even though there were probably only 50 people in the crowd. Finishing up with a cover of The Jesus and Mary chain Never Understand! They left the stage and were helping sell stuff from the merch table. The lead singer took a picture with 2 fans. How's that for up close and personal!The charm of this place melts off the fucking walls and seeps into your senses!!! {~;Come get UP CLOSE and PERSONAL with some live bands here!",5
Bottom of the Hill,Josiah B.,"Reno, NV","May 20, 2011","I went to my first show here and it literally changed my life. That show is the reason I'm pursuing a a career with this music stuff. Bottom of the Hill is probably one of coolest venues in the country. I've seen GREAT bands here and I've stood so close to them I could feel their energy like craaazy! The shows are always superbly organized and the small venue size let's bands meet their fans and even come out and party along with them when not headlining. This place is just too cool. If ABC ever closes this venue down I will never forgive them and my hate will be nasty and really scary! So go look at the calendar, find a show and support our local live music scene!",5
Bottom of the Hill,Ro R.,"East Bay, CA","May 5, 2011",Love Bottom of the Hill for four reasons: 1. Intimate venue (when I mean 'intimate' I mean small as hell...which is the way I like it)2. Decent prices on drinks 3. FREE and easy to find parking!!!!!! (For anyone that's ever driven in sf you understand)4. Good indie bands What more can a girl ask for?,5
Bottom of the Hill,Tom S.,"San Francisco, CA","May 2, 2011","I've gone to numerous shows at Bottom of the Hill, mostly in support of the local bands I know I love.The bands are all awesome. Generally, the sound guy does a great job. (Although some times it's just too darn loud--bring earplugs if you value your hearing!) Bar service is okay too, though on a busy night getting to the bar is nearly impossible and you'll have to wait for a while. It's a popular destination, and thus comes with all of the benefits and curses of being one.I almost always have a good time at this venue. However, I did have an incredibly infuriating experience ordering tickets online. I went through the incredibly shifty-looking ticket ordering page (that's linked through paypal) placed by order and received a booking number. Ostensibly, I had tickets! I even took a screen shot of the order page for good measure.However, when I showed up at the venue I was told I was not on the will call list and that I couldn't get in. I showed both the door man and the manager my booking number, and showed them the screen shot. But it was to no avail. I was told that their online ordering was a ""foolproof"" system and that I should have checked my credit card statement to confirm that the tickets were purchased.After checking my statement it did turn out that I had NO tickets, despite what I was led to believe on the website. Shame on me! Clearly their website not so foolproof, but since it's the bartender's pet project she's awfully defensive of it!My beef is that it's uncharacteristic for a web site to imply that you've booked your tickets without being billed, and that the bartender was so unsympathetic and uncompromising to a loyal customer.To Bottom of the Hill: fix your ""foolproof"" website, and I'll fix this review.",2
Bottom of the Hill,Ashley M.,"Antioch, CA","Apr 30, 2011","The prices were pretty good here on drinks and they have a good selection. I have nothing bad and nothing astounding to say about the bar tenders. On one occasion one bar tender took my order and someone else gave me the wrong beer. It was in the same price range and it was also a beer I liked so I didn't mind or complain, but it wasn't the one I asked for. The patio is lovely, but there isn't much seating. The stage and the live music is always good though and if you look on the wall a lot of really impressive acts have played here. I really enjoy myself here.",4
Bottom of the Hill,John R.,"San Diego, CA","Apr 29, 2011",Good place to catch a concert and get some food.  The ckicken nachos were suprisingly fresh. BRING CASH!,4
Bottom of the Hill,Carolyn F.,"San Francisco, CA","Apr 12, 2011","I've seen both bands on the rise and bands on the decline here. So if you want to stand just inches away from your future (or past) idols as they perform, come here! There really are lots of things to love about BOTH: very little pretension, cheap tickets prices (no exorbitant fees!), cheap drink prices, cool little patio area, small setting, easy parking, food on offer (can't fully recommend though....). Sometimes the sound system goes through kinks and there are delays. But it's all part of the charm, right?",4
Bottom of the Hill,John S.,"Salt Lake City, UT","Apr 10, 2011","This is my favorite spot in the city to catch a concert. A lot of small band coming through this place on their way to bigger and better things, and a lot of bands come that you discover that you would otherwise have never heard before. The venue is intimate, small, cozy, and you can go over and give the band members a high five right afterwards. In terms of the other parts of the venue: the drinks are decent (they have guinness on tap, which always makes my day), and the staff are friendly, and the crowd is always fun and not usually too douchey. (I'm also completing this review just so I can mark the shiny new ""hipster"" checkbox that yelp has now)The only downsides are that the the sound system could be (a lot) better. One band I went to see had a female vocalist, who was completely blown out by the sound system. As a bonus, from the vantage point of on top of the hill that this venue is on the bottom of of, the stage is beneath ground level, therefore, you can check out bands while they're still, literally, underground",5
Bottom of the Hill,Whitney C.,"Pismo Beach, CA","Apr 10, 2011","This place is my perfect music venue. Total divey and small and perfect. CASH ONLY at the bar so be prepared. They have food available too but I didn't get any. The place can maybe hold 150-200 tops. It is narrow and super personal so if your favorite band is playing there you are are in luck because even if you are in the back you are still ""close"". They have a small outdoor patio that you can go hang out on and there are table ledges on the walls for your to pony up a seat and eat. The people that work there are cool and parking is not an issue. Even if you don't know the band, if you have a free night i'd suggest buying a ticket (they are generally really cheap) and going for the atmosphere. That's what I did and I had a blast!Definitely will keep this place in mind when planning for upcoming evenings out.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Rachel F.,"Portland, OR","Mar 29, 2011","BEST F***ING VENUE IN THE CITY. No, I'm not biased because I got to meet a member of the National and Sharon Van Etten here. NOT AT ALL. Don't let the location fool you, this place is amazing. They get great bands and the sound quality is pretty impressive for such a small venue. Crowds never get crazy or mosh-y at the shows here; you'll have plenty of wiggle room. They have Anchor Steam and Pyramid on tap. Worries = none. There's also a patio out back if you need some air. They have food that I haven't gotten to try yet. Don't know too much about that. It's very comparable to the Troubadour in L.A.Parking is unbelievably easy, too.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Tiffany O.,"Long Beach, CA","Mar 23, 2011","Saw Kate Nash a while back at this lovely little venue. I haven't been back since, but I enjoyed it so much I had to review it now that I use yelp religiously.I'm not going to lie, when my friends and I first drove up to the venue, we were like ""THIS is it?"" We were there about an hour before will call opened, and it didn't look as if anyone was around or in the venue. So we just waited until we saw other civilization to get out and get in line. Parking is also weird. Hopefully you can find some on the street near the venue, but you probably have to get there significantly earlier than the show itself.When we entered, I was surprised at how narrow the standing room was. Scared that I wouldn't be able to see the performances, lo and behold I was right at the front even though I hadn't been the first in line.I was afraid the sound system would suck, given that I was right in front of the speaker. It turned out to be just fine, and the sound quality was pretty good. Maybe it was just the artist herself, but set up did take a long time and we all got pretty anxious.My friend got a beer and I think it was reasonably priced. After the show we hung around and no one seemed to mind. Overall, it's a nice place for shows and I'm glad Kate Nash performed at this location. I look forward to seeing more bands here soon.",4
Bottom of the Hill,C Q.,"San Francisco, CA","Mar 11, 2011","I finally got to check this place out to see my fave band Asobi Seksu.  Rather small, divey, and toasty inside, so you need not bring your jacket unless you're planning to hang out on the back patio.  Decent venue for a local show, I'm pretty short and was able to see the band from a few different spots.  I was also able to chit chat with my friends over the volume, that's a plus.  So there's a legend I heard about-- the glass in back of the stage--many performers have tried to break it but they can't, it's solid ROCK...I've also heard that there are magical unicorns and cotton candy.I could be biased about this place because I was seeing my fave band live for the first time, but I'd definitely return for a different show.  Can't beat $12, and it's got some charm.  Crowd is chill, hipsters n such.   Bar n food.  Oh, and parking is easy if you drive.PS. Website tix are kinda tricky, thought I'd purchased and got a confirmation number, but my card was not charged and I didn't show up on the list so I had to buy em at the door.  Cool place.

The staff are unfriendly low wits, the bathrooms are too few and horrible, and the drinks are lame (if you can get one).  I do not understand why anybody things this is a great venue.  I guess only because there is hardly any classy venues around.  I prefer the Great American Music hall ten times to this.  I will not come back.

If I get the hall pass on that one, rest assured one of the first items I'll work on is seeing more live music at Bottom of the Hill.There's a litany of reasons why I strive for more face time at this legendary Potrero Hill music venue, and for ease of reading (or maybe a carefully constructed mirage to mask the fact that I'm afflicted with a mild case of the bottle flu this morning and not feeling overly creative at the moment), I'll supply a short but steady list of why it's one of the greatest places in town to see art in motion:1. It's such a warm room with fantastic acoustics. Most definitely one of the best sounding venues in SF with a continually stellar line up of both local and national acts. 2. It's super easily accessible via the 22 or 10 Muni lines (sure there's more I'm missing as well).3. Some of the cheapest drinks that you'll find in a live concert venue. $3.50 for PBR on draft and other American staples in the bottle. 4. They have an awesome staff who never seem to wake up on the wrong side of the bed before coming into work.5. A great patio for having a smoke break (if that's how you roll), or just getting some fresh air if you're not feeling some artsy fartsy, shoe gazer opening act.6. They have some pretty damn good food as well! Even a few vegetarian options by way of veggie burgers, veggie hot dogs, hummus plates, and a gourmet option of grilled purple potato tacos marinated in their al pastor spicy broth (obviously before being drenched atop a pile of swine). Heck, you might even ask if it's vegan, as it very well might be if you exclude the sour cream and cheese that comes along with it.I'm sure there are way, way more notables to add in the future, but really - if this doesn't convince someone to want to stop what they're doing to take a peek at their concert calendar, they're better off just staying at home.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Erin F.,"Oakland, CA","Feb 16, 2011","Had THEEE best time at a show here. I didn't have tickets but happened to manage getting in anyway. It was a magical Nick and Norah type of adventure. The girl checking ideas was bouncy and friendly and hopeful for me. The drinks were fairly cheap. There's a back smoking porch. And the venue is so tiny that the intimacy of the place is pretty amazing, you could just waltz up to the ""stage"" and shake the hand of band members you've admired for years. Not to mention some awesome shows have been played here. I'm just even thinking of recently: forgetters, the get up kids, rx bandits, ted leo, murder by death, max bemis, street eaters. They've got ska nights and a bunch of awesome local bands, not to mention the bigger names that seem to drop by more than once in a blue moon. The sound in this place is pretty raw, but there's nothing better. This place is fantastic.",5
Bottom of the Hill,John L.,"Turlock, CA","Feb 5, 2011","Just saw Pinback here lastnight. Great show, great acoustics, staff was wonderful - no problem getting a drink that wasn't outrageously priced. Have seen rock to indie to hip-hop shows here. Will definitely be keeping a close eye on the calendar.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Robert K.,"San Francisco, CA","Feb 4, 2011","BotH, you were the first venue I saw a show at in San Francisco, and I thought you looked like the bar in a cool movie and had a killer time (mountain goats show '03).  Later I started a band with my friends and playing on your stage was about the most far off goal I could conceive of. Then I did that, several times, and you continued to be awesome all around.Wish I came out more but I'm old now like the dude in the giving tree (ok, not really).  keep it loud, BotH.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Natan O.,"Portland, OR","Jan 29, 2011","Just like its sister venue ""Thee Parkside,"" the Bottom of the Hill is a great, small, intimate place to see some of the best bands around.  The sound quality is better than decent, there are great beers on tap, and there is ample viewing room to see the reasonably heightened stage.  The patio out back is also a great addition to this place as it can get a little stuffy and sweaty (as expected with other venues and not nearly as bad as Thee Parkside).The tickets are usually between $10-$20 and this is more than a fair price to see a great live band in the heart of the Potrero district.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Chris M.,"San Francisco, CA","Jan 26, 2011","Intimate venue to catch some live musicIt's a little out of the way for non-drivers but that makes parking easy for the drivers!I went along to see a friends band, I had always been put off before by the travel, I'm glad I made the effort and will visit again.Drinks are reasonably priced",3
Bottom of the Hill,Rebecca G.,"Walnut Creek, CA","Dec 26, 2010","Bottom of the Hill is a great place to check out a show. It's small and intimate. There's usually (inexpensive) tickets at the door, and one of my favorite things is that there's plenty of parking! This venue is pretty hard to get to via public transit from the East Bay though. There's also ins and outs for those 21+. There is a cozy smoking patio out back which is nice on summer nights. The sound system is very hit or miss. Sometimes it sounds awful, distorted and way too loud, and other times, I have no problem with it. I love shooting photos of bands here. The lighting is excellent, and it's easy to get close to the stage. I usually stand by steps leading to the stage and I always get great shots here.I also love the Sunday BBQ shows here. They're cheap and they feed you as you catch the show! A long time ago, I caught Alkaline Trio playing a BBQ show here on my birthday! I feasted, sang my heart out, and got to hang with the band after the show. It's quite easy to meet the bands after the show here which is awesome.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Carla H.,"Chicago, IL","Dec 20, 2010","I went out to the Bay Area for a weekend to celebrate my birthday, and my trip was kind of centered around my friends' band playing this venue.  I've seen my friends' band in lots of places, but felt compelled to review this one.  I LOVED this place from the moment I walked in the door!  Great layout, lighting dim enough so as to not blind you but not so dark you can't see where the heck you're going.  I had just been picked up at the airport and needed to change, so I made my way out the side door to the courtyard to head upstairs to the dressing room.  Had to have someone carry my suitcase up the stairs, but that was the only negative of the entire night.  I was concerned about maneuvering the steps back down once I was wearing heels, but they were safe!Great service at the bar, nice strong drinks, good prices.....  Even though I managed to spend like $100! (yeah, I got kinda tipsy - but I was on vacation and not driving!)Whoever mixes the sound for this venue does a GREAT job!  It doesn't look like it's an easy room to mix, and he did fantastic!  All 3 bands sounded great (but I am biased and partial to the headlining Dave Rude Band that night :) )  I liked that you could stand almost anywhere out front of the house and see well.  If you want a break, you can go out in the courtyard or have a seat in the back and actually carry on a conversation without shouting.  All in all, a great experience here.  Looking forward to rocking out in here again!",5
Bottom of the Hill,Mitchell M.,"Anaheim, CA","Dec 19, 2010","I saw a show hear a few years ago and loved it, but I have to make some things clear:This place is tiny. Like an old gym locker in both size and, depending on how late into the night, smell. The staff is quick, friendly, and efficient. If you find yourself dragged here by either friend or enemy, take heart, you can always mosey to the rear for pool or stand in the outside patio.""Backstage"" is located upstairs from the patio, so if you wait long enough you'll probably meet the band. The place stays open until last call.The acoustics are what you would expect, harsh. Wear ear plugs so your auditory system can make sense of the cacophony. That said, I saw the same band two days apart both here and at the Troubadour in Hollywood and (strangely) they sounded much better here.Keep in mind that this venue is not really in the most awesome place in town and if you scare easy either have a rental or call a taxi and wait inside.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Angeline P.,"Queens, New York, NY","Dec 15, 2010","So there must be some disconnect here between what I'm seeing/hearing and what other people are seeing/hearing. Surface level stuff: They get great bands to play here, ticket prices are reasonable, parking is sketchy, venue is small and intimate.The sound, however, is awful. I've been here twice: once for the Polysics and once for Kate Nash. I understand that the Polysics are all about distortion and noise. I get that. That's why I came back to see Kate Nash. When the Polysics and Kate Nash have the same sound quality, something is up.The music was deafeningly loud. Unrestrained, distorted, impossible to enjoy without earplugs (which I definitely prefer to go without at most places, but here it was necessary).  I had a seriously difficult time convincing myself to go see Kate Nash at the Warfield, but I'm glad I did because everything there was fabulous. The problem wasn't Kate Nash, it was Bottom of the Hill. How can a concert venue get away with sound this horrible?I will not be coming back. What's the point in spending money to see someone you like get completely distorted and skewed by noise?",2
Bottom of the Hill,Denise S.,"San Francisco, CA","Dec 5, 2010","Bottom of the Hill is a rockin' good time.It's a great venue: not too big nor too small. They have a full bar, great crowd lots of room to stand, dance and get funky. They have a pretty good selection of beer and the drinks are reasonably priced. They also have a larger seating area in the back and a fantastic outdoor patio. I had the pleasure of watching some bands play the other night and I had so much fun listening to them and the DJ.The only problem is that the bathroom is in an awkward location and is kind of small. But I got over it. After all, I didn't go to hang out in the bathroom all night. Can't wait to head back.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Charlene S.,"Union City, CA","Nov 29, 2010","I saw MAE w/ Terrible things on MAE's farewell tour and really enjoyed the Venue. Small, quaint but still enough space to breathe and enjoy the music. I will definitely be back to see future shows.",4

The staff is great, the crowd is great, the shows are great. I've seen some of my favorite bands here and I have never been disappointed with the quality of sound. It's small but not too small. I love the funky decor as well. There's also food and a seating area in the back if you're tired of standing.I have never ever been disappointed with this place and it is honestly one of my favorite venues in SF.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Heather M.,"Berkeley, CA","Nov 5, 2010","Love Bottom of the HIll!  Nearly perfect venue,  great atmosphere, awesome music and a smart layout to the place makes it a favorite in my book... however the cover charges could be a little lower.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Sandeep R.,"Burlingame, CA","Nov 2, 2010","Bottom on the Hill is the Shit! there are so many famous bands out there that have played at bottom of the hill of will be playing here. This place is an important part of the underground music scene in San Francisco just rating the place cannot give you the significane it has on the local music scene. They always have great bands playing no matter what day you go. the sound quality is just awesome loud and raw. Usually theres like a $15 cover charge depending on the night. The atmosphere is dark and intricate. The crowd here are all music lovers and you can see everyone totally enjoying the performances.The drinks they serve at the bar are strong. You wouldn't normally go here to eat but if u must, the little kitchen on the side makes some killer burgers!",5
Bottom of the Hill,Bob M.,"Hagatna, Guam","Oct 29, 2010",This is a really fun club. Best if you go to an all ages show.,5
Bottom of the Hill,Heather J.,Bay Area,"Oct 22, 2010","Bottom of the Hill puts on a good show.Xiu Xiu, The Morning Benders, Au Revoir Simone and Oh no! Oh my! all put on awesome shows there. The venue has a nice, intimate atmosphere and there's a really fun crowd that sees shows there. I always run into people I know at Bottom of the Hill, probably because they always put on shows with local artists. The only downside is that it's a kind of sketchy place to park your car. I parked mine right in front of the venue and definitely got my window smashed and my car broken into during the show. Bummer! So maybe next time I'll take BART and take a bus there.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Doug A.,"Oakland, CA","Oct 19, 2010","Man oh man this place brings so many memories to me. I have been coming here since I first moved to the Bay Area in 1993. I have seen so many great shows here over the years. I remember the place when it seemed a lot smaller. They did a makeover of the place at some point and opened it up more. The place is great and I have to get back here at some point to see another show......it's been at least a few months. One complaint I have is that they have never had shirts for sale advertising the club itself. I have a 9:30 Club tshirt from Washington D.C and I would like to wear a ""Bottom of the Hill"" tshirt when I go back home and visit DC later this year. C'mon marketing staff, makes some. I will be the 1st to buy one!",4
Bottom of the Hill,Nicole B.,"Menlo Park, CA","Oct 5, 2010","I love Bottom of the Hill, they have great shows every so often (I'd say I go every couple months). I applaud them for booking as many shows here as they do, even if some are not of the quality I would attend. I love seeing pop-punk bands here because it creates a small atmosphere that lets you share the night with the band you're seeing. You're almost certain to meet the members (unless they spend the whole night upstairs), but for the most part they have to walk through people in order to play the show, so if you wanted to, and if they were willing, it's easy to talk to someone here, although it's typically pretty loud.The sound here is okay, not the best, but definitely up there for the type of place it is. The stage is a good height and I'd be surprised if there's one person in the whole place who can't see what's going on. Not the best on parking, and my friend once got her car broken into while parked for a show there, but for the most part it's best to get a spot on that street, in front of the venue, because if you're parked down an alley, those are the sketch areas.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Lauren B.,"Ukiah, CA","Oct 4, 2010","Great venue with a ""neighborhood"" vibe.  It can get a little cramped depending on the show, but I wouldn't trade the intimate vibe for a bigger venue.  It just means that if you need to get a beer or go to the bathroom, you'll have to make your way through the crowd (and you will also have people making their way through you when you're trying to enjoy the music).",4
Bottom of the Hill,K S.,"Berkeley, CA","Oct 2, 2010","I love you Bottom of the Hill!I have seen some of the best shoes there and have had some of the best times ever there. I love the vibe, love the bands, love the bar. Thanks!",5
Bottom of the Hill,Mitchell L.,"San Francisco, CA","Sep 27, 2010","This is my favorite music venue in San Francisco.  The set up is superb with the stage near the middle of the space and the bar readily accessible in the front.  There is an open area in the back including an outdoor section and a space for bands to hawk their wares in the rear.I've seen several shows here and the crowd is usually excellent, bartenders attentive (drinks are inexpensive), and bouncer friendly.  The location is out in Portrero Hill aka BFE but on the plus side, parking is abundant.Once I came here to see Memory Tapes and the guitarist/vocalist felt comfortable enough to jump down and rock out amidst the crowd for a few songs.  Great performance.  It's also a lot easier to interact with band members after sets when they feel inclined to do so.  You will not get any of that at a show at Fox Theater, etc. where clusterf-ed crowds are the norm.",5

Bottom of the Hill,Laury C.,"Fairfax, CA","Aug 30, 2010","So - went to Bottom of the Hill to see this great band - Band of Brotherz on Saturday night.  They are a kick ass band that rocked the place.  If it weren't for the Band of Brotherz and all of the other great music that this place books I would NEVER come here.  In fact, I probably won't go back to this place again.  Why?  Well, when my girlfriend was ordering her drink from one bartender, the other bartender was clearing the bar of drinks and took her money that she had laid down to pay for the drink from the other bartender.  When she asked why he just took her money, he said ""what money"".  When she persisted he shrugged and took $5.00 out of the register and just laid it down in front of her and walked off.  Then when she got her drink, she took a sip and while she was putting her change in her pocket, the same dude cleared the bar again and poof - her drink was gone.  Again, she asked what the hell he was doing and he said, just clearing the bar.  When my other friend was at the bar to order drinks, same dude bartender skimmed him on his change.  When my friend called him on it, the bar manager came over and defended skimmer dude.  When my friend didn't drop it, bar manager tossed my friend out of the bar.   Bottom line for Bottom of the Hill, DON'T leave your money on the bar, because the bartenders assume all is fair game.   Be aware of what money you're giving them and count your change and finally DON'T leave your drink on the bar.  I think that these guys are counting on the patrons either being too drunk or too high to notice that they're being fleeced.  I didn't see anyone else mention this in all of the other reviews, but after the show, when word got around about my two friend's experience, other people piped up that they thought the same thing had happened to them, but that they must have been mistaken.  Too bad.  Pretty sweet deal for the bartenders, not so much for the patrons or the owners of Bottom of the Hill.",2

Bottom of the Hill,Kristina L.,"San Mateo, CA","Aug 6, 2010","A place where you can go to a punk rock show and actually have reasonably priced, decent-to-good mixed drinks?! Yes! And that's only one of the reasons why I love you so much, Bottom of the Hill.Seriously, this is my favorite venue in the city, with thee Parkside coming in second now that Annie's Social Club is closed. Bottom of the Hill is nearly perfect. You can have good drinks if you're not a beer/shot person, there's a smoking patio so you never have to leave the venue (good for those under 21, who aren't allowed ins & outs), the ventilation is good, parking is super easy, it's easy to drive to, fairly easy to bus to (but not so easy to bus away from late at night), the people who work here are amiable (one of 'em sang ""Let it Be"" this one time I was wearing a Beatles shirt), all sorts of good bands play here for usually less than $20, and the sound is decent.I've been to over two dozen shows here - probably a hell of a lot more than that - and even when the bands sucked, I still enjoyed myself, which might have something to do with the fact that the bartenders can mix decent drinks, unlike other places where I've been to shows. There was a good deal of confusion the first time I got up the nerve to ask for an AMF here, which was a few years ago, but with a little discussion, they got it right. I've since realized that it's probably not the best idea to drink a toxic-looking, aquamarine concoction while seeing, say, the Dwarves or No Use For a Name or something, since at least a quarter of it will end up sloshed onto my person when it gets rowdy, but it's nice to know that you can have one, right?Oh, and if you're not planning on getting a tasty, albeit usually greasy, snack at the venue, definitely eat beforehand so that you don't end up down the street at the Connecticut Yankee like every other schmuck who goes to Bottom of the Hill with an empty stomach, and then ends up having an absurdly named (who wants to say ""I'd like the pee-wee herman"" when they could say ""I'll have a pulled pork sandwich""?), mediocre meal at a sports bar.",5

Bottom of the Hill,Kimi M.,"Parkville, MO","Jul 26, 2010","This is a great small venue!My hubby and I saw the Toadies. We arrived early so we could get parking close by and also catch a bite to eat along 18th. The doors didn't open until 8:30p so be prepared to stand outside in the cold for a bit if you are early. Once the doors opened you will need to show  your ID and get a bracelet if you want drinks. You also get the ever-so-fancy hand stamp even though a sign said ""No ins/outs"". The decor was filled with kitschy random items along with a cityscape fun house like design. I love these types of places! They have so much more character. They also have a kitchen if you choose to partake in the bar food. There is even seating in the back area past the stage. Drinks were reasonable and the people were pretty easy going. No complaints there. I would definitely go back for future concerts.",4

Bottom of the Hill,Julia N.,"Elk Grove, CA","Jul 1, 2010","Last night was my first visit to Bottom of the Hill to see Dum Dum Girls. I went on a whim so I had no idea what to expect. Those that like a lot of space while watching a show will not find joy in coming to this venue. It is SMALL and the people are packed in like sardines. When we entered there was literally people over flowing in to the entrance. We had to side step and get all Matrix-like to get in to the heart of the crowd. I didn't mind that so much as it gave the place a very (very) cozy feel but if I had a choice, I'd definitely opt for some more breathing room. Along with that, because it's so small you really feel as if you're apart of the show; you get to experience the band in a way that you wouldn't in a huge arena. It's a trek from where I live but worth it if there's somebody you're excited to see!",3

Bottom of the Hill,brant f.,"San Francisco, CA","May 22, 2010","Though they rarely have bands I'm interested in these days, it's not because Bottom Of The Hill have lost touch with the pulse of the indie scene, it's that at 31; who-the-fuck-am-I-kidding that I have any real pulse on music outside of when I was cool in my twenties, Pitchfork and the occasional bone thrown me by a co-worker, that said, Bottom Of The Hill gets five stars. Since I was seventeen I've been frequenting this place. Seen hundreds of shows here from Elliott Smith to the Murder City Devils and certainly drank a ton. And, for a venue, the drinks are fairly priced, liberally liquored, the service fast. The atrium is great for us smokers, I always run into someone I haven't seen for years, and the graffiti in the bathroom is above par. Though I realize my glory years as a concert goer are over, I still will go whenever a band I actually know plays there, like The Good Life in a couple weeks,....see you there.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Mimi T.,"Berkeley, CA","May 6, 2010","I have come here to see two shows.The first one was a really fun Built for the Sea show (I loved their opening act Anderson and bought their euro poppy cd as soon as their set was over), and the other show was my  friend's band Ghost n the City.I like that you can sit in the back area or go in the outside area if you need a break from being inside although both times I was there it was too cold outside for me to want to do that. The huge downside of this club for me is how crowded it gets. I'm 5 foot 2 so if I want to see the band I need to stand near the front or to the side of the stage. If you stand to the side people will pretty much constantly walk past you and/or bump into you. The plus side is the food. I was pretty stoked the first time I went to be able to order a hummus plate. As a hungry vegan I wasn't expecting to find something I could eat on their menu. I wanted food the second time I went but they didn't have the food window open. Sad. As for the music - the sound is good and the venue does a really good job of keeping the lag time in between bands to a minimum. I really appreciated that.",3

Bottom of the Hill,Rebecca R.,"Berkeley, CA","Apr 27, 2010","I've been coming to this club since 1991 and had to stop and reflect for a moment once I realized it's been around that long. Wow. Places just don't seem to have the staying power they used to, but BOTH has been doing something right for a LONG time and I hope they are here for twenty more years at least! They have become an institution. I've seen so many amazing shows here, I don't even know where to begin. Most notable, to me, was the last Guitar Wolf show in the Bay Area before Billy died and one of the last Bay Area performances by Morphine (1991 or 1992, I think) before Mark Sandman died. Those performances will stay with me always. Billy even gave me his bass pick which I keep in a special place on my night stand. RIP, Billy, you are missed. Man, what other shows have I seen here? Polkacide, Dead Hensons, Thee Coachwhips, Polysics, Acid Mothers Temple, Three Day Stubble, Lord Loves a Working Man, The Billy Nayer Show, Faun Fables, Mermen, El Vez, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, this list goes on and on. They know how to book good music, that's for damn sure! The ticket prices are always reasonable, the drinks aren't too over-priced with a good selection of beer/liquor, they have food to coat your drinking belly, and they have a nice back area to smoke in. My only complaint is the tiny ass bathroom. Two stalls for the entire ladies room. It can be quite the back-up in there on busy nights and it is here that I came up with my brilliant idea of Depends for music fans but they would be called something cheesy like 'Rockers!'. Don't want to miss your favorite band's next set but have to piss like a racehorse? You don't have to brave the hour-long wait for the bathroom any longer...with ""ROCKERS!"" Ahhhh...Okay, it started as a joke but don't act like you haven't thought about this, too. BOTH is one of my favorite venues to see live music in the city. I have had a few problems with drunken douchebags who don't know how to act in public and who flail their elbows around wildly without care to the craniums of those around them that they land upon, but a return elbow in the gut and a fierce look usually works. Back the fuck off, I'm an old school punk bitch and will TAKE YOU DOWN. I'd give them five stars except for the drunken idiot factor. They don't really seem to deal with people acting like jerks and ruining everyone else's good time very well. But still, BOTH is a great place to see music and I highly recommend you visit them if you haven't already. Oh, yeah, the staff has never had any attitude in any way in all my years of being a patron. That, unfortunately, seems to be rare in music clubs these days.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Paul M.,"Berkeley, CA","Apr 24, 2010","All the comments about how small and intimate music is at this venue are TRUE. I tried it out because I happen to live really close, but it is a huge perk to living in Potrero Hill. The cover is usually cheap and the crowd in a good pro-music chill mood. A lot of sound in a small place. Treat yourself to some ear plugs at the bar for 50 cents.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Romy I.,"Oakland, CA","Apr 19, 2010","What a pleasant little dive--I saw the Chinese Invasion Tour 2010 here and had a nice time talking to the people that worked there.  I was actually surprised that there are many places like this left in San Francisco, but they assured me that they were still able to keep going despite the high costs that had driven out most of the creative people that made the music and art scene great. Most of the good music has moved out to the East Bay, particularly Oakland, so it's nice to know that Portrero Hill still has the fire going.It's a nice, spacious place, with food (but I didn't actually eat that night) and a great bar. I love the bartender's handlebar moustache. I'm glad that places like this still exist in San Francisco; it would've been sad if there were nothing but wine bars and gourmet restaraunts in Portrero Hill.",4

I'll definitely be heading back here for more shows!",4

One negative is the late start times of most shows here. No matter, all the positives definitely outweigh the one negative. I won't hesitate to come back to BOTH.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Jonny A.,"San Jose, CA","Mar 27, 2010","Best Bay Area venue hands down. You can always find parking nearby since it's in a quiet part of town where there aren't tons of open businesses nearby. Cost of the shows is always super cheap. Staff is amazing, down to the owner, who I believe is Lynn. Drinks are cheaply priced, food is tasty, sound is great, and you gotta love a venue that has pitchers of water at the bar for you after shows are over. I've been coming to this venue for almost 6 years now and every show has been loads of fun. I will be very sad if these all-ages venues get shutdown -- please help by expressing your concern to Senator Leno -- which I already did. We need to keep these superb venues around!",5
Bottom of the Hill,Marissa P.,"Portland, OR","Mar 10, 2010","Bottom of the Hill is a fun venue, although the layout is a bit strange and there are parts of the bar where it's difficult to see the stage. However, the drinks are affordable, the cover is reasonable and they usually book some good bands! The location is awful though! Nothing else is nearby it's a bit desolate late at night!",4
Bottom of the Hill,M M.,"Pleasant Hill, CA","Mar 6, 2010","I love this place.  It is a great place to see shows because even though it isn't huge, it has a nice mix of bar and show atmosphere.  If you get bored with the show, you can go to the bar and mingle and it doesn't seem weird/rude.  Granted, I wouldn't suggest doing keg stands or anything like that because you do want to respect the artist(s) that are performing.  Parking is really easy to find within a couple blocks and the place is reasonably priced for drinks/shows.This place is also great for shows because it is small enough that the bands hang around and drink with fans/friends.  The bartenders are really good at getting to everybody in a timely fashion.  I never had to wait more than 2 minutes at the bar.  Most places I go to, I find that you have to go to the one foot space at the bar where the bartender serves.  Here, they notice the people who are waiting regardless of where they are positioned.  That sounds weird, but its true!The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because it is so far away from everything.  If you are coming from the freeway, it is close, but if you live in the actual city, it seems soooooooo far!  It is also really quiet there at night and kind of industrial looking so I suggest meeting friends beforehand and riding together.  I don't like being anywhere late at night alone especially when there are no witnesses walking around!",4
Bottom of the Hill,Jenn C.,"San Francisco, CA","Mar 2, 2010","Saw an afternoon NoisePop show here.  I felt somewhat out of place considering the disproportionate number of youngins and teens present at the venue, but it seems BotH always draws interesting and diverse crowds.What a difference ear plugs make!It's a small venue, but oddly, it's spacious enough that you never get uncomfortable.  There are tables and booths in the back and a patio just out behind the stage.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Andrea D.,"San Diego, CA","Feb 27, 2010","Came here last night for part of the noise pop fest and had a blast! I can't believe I've never been here before. Street parking!! Patio to get fresh air after dancing/bouncing around to awesome music and I can bring my beer out with me... now this makes me smile. Good acoustics and okay draft selection. Great layout, energy and people. Bathroom is 'bearable' and the place is a little grimy- but it works. Overall an awesome and intimate music venue!  Seems like a charming sort of ""spring board"" venue for indie bands that are a few shows away from making it big. I could just imagine being old and gray, and telling little youngins that I saw ""so and so"" back in the day here as they gaze back in awe- kind of like when my dad told me he saw Jimi or Zeppelin at the Filmore... okay maybe not that cool... like that cool divided by 8.  Still fairly cool.",4
Bottom of the Hill,S J.,"Los Gatos, CA","Feb 23, 2010","Dwarves, Zeke, Spazz and so many shows that I barely remember.  This is an amazing venue to see well-established and emerging bands.  Plus, there are no parking issues and you could even walk to and from the Mission if you're drunk enough.  This place reminds me of Al's bar in Downtown LA which is now closed.  It's nice to get there early and quench my thirst plenty before the crowd funnels in.",5

Bottom of the Hill,Makinde P.,"Novato, CA","Feb 11, 2010","This is one of those places aspiring musicians wish there was more of. If there were more places like this, less people would be out murdering and stealing and instead would be playing music or rocking out!!! The venue is small but they don't pack the place super tight, there's an area in the back that has some restaurant-style seating and you can still hear the band well from there. I ate some chicken tacos that were very generous (for 6 bucks it's a good thing they were), and had some pints to enjoy which were also well priced. I just saw two great shows two days in a row here, on the first day was Vivian Girls, which was a group i've never heard of before but sounded great! The second day I saw the duo Eyedea and Abilities doing what they do best, and they did! When I got up this morning my head was still ringing with beats, they threw down some fresh shit!  I'll definitely look out for more artists coming through here!",5
Bottom of the Hill,Alan F.,"Mission District, CA","Jan 31, 2010","Bottom of the Hill has quickly become my favorite venue for live shows here in the city. The most exciting time to see a band is right when they're on the verge of breaking out and becoming well known. Bottom of the Hill is a smallish venue that aims to book lots of bands, many local, while they're still on their way up.The result is usually an intimate show, with bands that enjoy performing and want to make a name for themselves and a crowd that's more involved with seeking out new artists and live shows.The setup here is pretty sweet as well. I could pick out each instrument in a 6 piece band without even trying, and there's a sizable lounge and back porch where you can spy on how far along the set rotation is.The people who work here are totally sweet also. Here's an example: after last night's show ended there was a dude out cold on the sidewalk around the corner. The door guy happened to notice and immediately began to fret over taking care of the poor dude and getting him inside and taken care of, in spite of the fact that the show ran late and everyone was trying to close up and this was no small passed out dude.I've seen: Battlehooch w/ Judgment Day, Gliss w/ Morning Ater Girls,Fuck Buttons, and These Arms are Snakes here.Great bands, small space, excellent acoustics, clever setup, cool crowd, employees that nurse you back to health, good times!",5
Bottom of the Hill,Adam D.,"San Francisco, CA","Jan 24, 2010","Definitely one of the cooler small venues I've been to in San Francisco. At $10 to see a Swedish swing hip hop plus two decent opening bands (and $3.50 for a PBR) it's not going to break your wallet either. The area seems a bit sketchy, so drive if you can (ample parking) or take a cab.  If the show I went to was any indication, openers start at 10:00pm, so don't expect the headliner to finish until 1:30am or so.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Jonathan S.,"Los Angeles, CA","Jan 22, 2010","The bands were good. not great, but good. They were fairly famous, but more of the grunge indie rock and less of the folky or popy indie rock that I prefer - that could have just been due to the night we went. By the time it got late, there were too many people. People were closer than elbow to elbow. My girlfriend and I had to push and shove just to get to a different part of the floor, then a group of drunk people were yelling at me and my girlfriend all night. Regardless of those lame guys (which we saw there again the next night), I felt that it was so crowded that in a fire, I would probably get trampled before reaching an exit, and I'm not usually a claustrophobic guy. Although we didn't know the bands, I had heard ""of"" a couple of them. This place is said to get a lot of good bands. It was a fun place full of people from 21-35. It would be even better if it wasn't so crowded, but it was still pretty good. The food isn't great, but it's better than going hungry :). It's a little difficult to find a cab afterwards though.",4

Bottom of the Hill,Holly B.,"San Francisco, CA","Jan 5, 2010","This is hands down one of my favorite places to watch a good show. I've been to hundreds of live shows over the course of my teenage/young adult life and I've never, EVER had a bad time at Bottom of the Hill. I've seen some great bands here (local favs like my friends in Mi Ami, Deerhoof, Brilliant Colors) and other indie acts (Outhud, Cause Co-motion!, Crystal Stilts). This place is a venue where bands can play loud and you can still chill out and have a non-shouting conversation with your friends on the patio or over a game of pool.All you need is less than 20 bucks in your pocket and you can have a super smooth bike ride out here where the people aren't pretentious and you can catch a great, local live show.Even if the band playing that night sucks mad donkey balls, this place would still be awesome.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Kimberly B.,"San Francisco, CA","Dec 13, 2009","Why haven't I written a review of this place before?  I've been to dozens of shows here over the years, but admittedly don't go to as many shows as I used to now that I'm a grown-up.  (Gone are the days of taking MUNI an hour each way to see a show on a work night!)I went here the other night to see The Slits and was reminded of why I like this place.  The venue is intimate, but not too small.  (Although, I've been at sold out shows where it DID feel small when I was being crushed against a wall.)  The bar has a good selection of beers on tap and there's a kitchen if you feel like ordering food.  I also love the decor...posters from old shows on the walls and holiday lights all around.Best of all is that there's ample street parking, so you're not going to have to circle for a half hour.  If you don't have a car and have to rely on MUNI to get around, the 22 Fillmore stops just a block away on (across from the Connecticut Yankee).As always, I wish there were more barstools, but I'll have to settle for getting to shows early to nab a spot to park my rear end for at least part of the evening....",4
Bottom of the Hill,Jessica L.,"CA, CA","Nov 20, 2009","I saw the last 20 Minute Loop show here!!!Plenty of street parking. A small venue for music. Nice big bar, small outside smoking patio. And random hot dogs for food. A pretty cool place!",4
Bottom of the Hill,David A.,"San Francisco, CA","Nov 4, 2009","Bottom of the Hill is the best music venue I've been to in San Francisco since I moved here a little over two years ago.  I try my best to go to around two shows a month so I can safely say I've seen a good amount of what San Francisco has to offer.  I saw Jens Lekman here a few months ago and it was one of the best shows I've seen in a long time. True, Jens Lekman never disappoints, but it's the intimacy of this venue that is its strongest point. Even if you come late to the show and find yourself in what would be the back row behind the tallest dude in the place, you're still close to the stage (and closer to the bar).  I'm not sure of the capacity, but it can't be anything over 200/250, which makes for a cozy collective. Besides the main bar area, there is a great space in the back in the back if you're just hanging out, along with a medium-sized patio for those Potrero Hill sulky evenings.An experience at a music venue can definitely depend on who the act is so its difficult to gauge the venue from night to night.  For instance, Jens Lekman, an adorable-Swedish-native-chamber-pop-charmer's show will be a lot different than say, the Everytime I Die show.  But I look at it for what it's worth: Bottom of the Hill is a classic, small, divey joint that's all about music, be it big names to the virtually unknown, jingle-jangle to supersonic boom.  So if you're going to see the likes of GWAR, well, prepare to be pushed around a bit.Oh, and the beer is cold and cheap and delicious.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Tiffany S.,"Berkeley, CA","Nov 2, 2009","Awesome venue. LOVE the outdoor area. They have pretty much ZERO security here. Came here to watch The Entrance Band.

The Entrance Band was pretty good too except these two stupid bitches pushed their way to the front and started dancing like maniacs and stinking up the ENTIRE venue with their horrendous B.O. Everyone had to back away from them and we all kept making WTF? faces at each other. Some chick yelled at them which didn't seem to faze them at all. Elbows were thrown, bf almost got in fight.

It's the perfect size to enjoy a mid-level band in an intimate setting, and the staff have always been very nice.I was inspired to write this review when on Saturday, 10.24, I wanted nothing more than to see The Mummies play. When I checked the website at 5pm, ticket status had gone from ""100 available at the door"" to ""some available at the door"" after the events people came through and grabbed a bunch. When I called and asked the bartender about this she was nice and explained the situation, and also gave me a heads-up that there were already 40 people waiting outside (2.5 hours before doors). Finally she let me know that The Mummies were also playing down the street at Thee Parkside, which directly let to me actually getting to see them that night.10.24.09 female bartender, you rule.",5

Drinks were reasonable priced, food was very inexpensive, no lines for the restrooms, and surprisingly excellent acoustics.  I'd love to go again.One potentially major drawback:  getting a cab in this part of town at midnight can be a Herculean effort.  Well worth it for the music though.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Chad L.,"San Francisco, CA","Oct 14, 2009","The Bottom of the Hill in San Francisco is a staple of the club scene in the Bay area. It doesn't quite have the history of the Gilman, but in falling just short of that, it has a great reputation all its own. It's probably one of the 5 coolest clubs around and being tiny as all hell that means a lot. You can see everything from a Girlfriend Experience show to the latest Airborne Toxic Event show. Lots of bands make a pass through the city still being relatively unknown and when they sell this place out they sometimes are forced to play larger venues just to fit more fans inside. But, when you want an intimate show featuring your favorite band the Bottom of the Hill will surely be the spot to look. Whether you're searching through Myspace music or just going directly to the Bottom of the Hill website, you're sure to find at least one thing you'll want to go to each month. So go down to the water and park around the corner and get your hand stamped to enter this dark little club with good beer and music galore. CHAD",4
Bottom of the Hill,Sharon M.,"Livermore, CA","Oct 14, 2009","I've been here a number of times for shows and have yet to have a bad experience.  Sold out shows can get crowded but you are still able to move around and not feel like a sardine. I've never had to wait long for entry, a drink,or the restroom which is a major bonus. No one wants to be spending time waiting in line for something when they could be watch a show. When a show becomes too rowdy you can find refuge the outdoor patio or seating area behind the stage. If you love the intimate setting of small venue - this is your place. Parking around the venue is abundant which I find to be an added bonus.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Jackie M.,"San Francisco, CA","Oct 12, 2009","I really like seeing shows at Bottom of the Hill, but after a recent experience I left disheartened thanks to their door people. The woman who ran the list/tickets was hostile and rude.You could tell by the look on her face upon entering that she was not a happy camper and as the situation elevated, her looks were not deceiving. When two different publications' writers should be on the list (email confirmations to prove it) and they're not, and you respond by being rude and abrasive, I call bullshit.I was shocked by how we were treated and it killed my night. After relaying my story to others, I found a couple of them had similar stories involving their list incompetency. I will still come here if I want to see a show, but I think cutting a couple of their staff (i.e. disgruntled ticket girl with short dark hair and anger issues) would do the venue some good.",3

In response, my friend was yelled at by the bar staff and treated like she not only didn't belong, but that she had no business complaining.  My friend had witnesses.  She asked for the police to be called.  But the staff, including the bouncer, dismissed her outright and all but told her to leave.

Bottom of the Hill,Aubree T.,"San Francisco, CA","Aug 30, 2009","I haven't eaten or drank alcohol here (still rocking that underage ID), but that doesn't change the fact that BOTH holds an awesome show. I saw a concert here, and it was mega sweet. It wasn't like a regular show, where you're kind of far away from the stage, and the band is behind-the-scenes all the time except when they're onstage...it's more like you're hanging out with your friends who happen to be playing music there. I talked to my favorite musicians, danced with them, saw them eat dinner at the table next to me, etc. The stage is small, and pretty low, so you feel a closer connection with the band. Everyone there was very friendly, and I enjoyed myself. (And only $12 at the door for my ticket!)There's a smoking patio, seating for dining, bar, plus the area in front of the stage for dancing and general mingling. Slight downside: the bathroom is tinyyy. I think it was only one stall (maybe two), and barely room for the sink. So if you feel like you'll have to use the restroom at some point and see that there isn't a line, take the advantage and go then. It'll save you the pain of a long, drunken line later when you REALLY have to go.The only problem I had was that it did get kind of overly loud, because it's such a small area, but it was still great and entirely worth it.",5

I heart the bartenders, they've helped me by stashing my jacket in the back since they are coat check-less. My boy Shefik just rocked a show here last night actually, and boy did he rock it hard. Not in a head banging mullet kind of way mind you, but again in a hip scenester way (matter of fact he's a Yelp newbie, go send love shefik.yelp.com, he'll love you long time, I told him Yelpers spread the love..) He's played here before and I'm sure he will again, and I much prefer he play here over Rickshaw, and Rickshaw is like right by my house. Speaks volumes when I'd rather take a 20 minute bus ride to B.O.T.H. over walking 5 minutes to Rickshaw.They've got tacos, booze, tons of beer, a chill patio... so good. As far as music venues around the city go, and we all know there are gobs of them, this is one of my favorites. Mostly because it just makes me feel so damn cool.",5

The venue is small  which makes it perfect for seeing bands before they get too big for their britches. They have a smoking patio which also allows you to hear and see the bands without having to stand in the crowd the entire time. I didn't eat, but they have a kitchen, which is convenient. Cash only which is not optimal, but a small inconvenience for such a cool venue.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Amanda M.,"Brooklyn, NY","Jul 16, 2009","I love Bottom of the Hill. I've seen some of my favorite bands here, including the Receiving End of Sirens before they broke up :(.It's never expensive, and it's right by Whole Foods so I can get some healthy vegan grub before the show that makes up for what I didn't spend on my concert ticket.It's also in Potrero Hill, which is one of my favorite little neighborhoods in the city.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Angela B.,"San Francisco, CA","Jun 30, 2009","Aaaaaand as long as we're reviewing live music venues...BotH was alright.  Tiny, which can be a plus if you want a REALLY good view of the band.  Laid back, which can be awesome (especially on a non-weekend night).  Beers are a bit overpriced.  Music was too loud for the space (at the risk of sounding like an old person), and sound design left something to be desired.  (They're not all metal bands, folks...)  But it wasn't bad.  I'd go back if it was a band I was excited about.",3
Bottom of the Hill,Alex H.,"San Francisco, CA","Jun 26, 2009","I am a fan of random happenings. And something random always happens every time I go to Bottom of the Hill. I saw a lead singer pass out drunk before his performance. I saw a group of girls wear shirts of the band performing. (You never wear shirts of the band). I saw a guitarist once try and schmooze for booze when he was clearly under age. And I got asked out by a drummer who not only had a large gap between his teeth, but also forgot he had a girlfriend. These may not be the most ideal things that can happen at a music venue, but they are definitely interesting. Live music is always a plus, and I'm always supportive for the SF music scene. So if you're looking for a good time--a laugh, a smile or even something worth blogging about--reserve your next ticket at Bottom of the Hill. Because music + booze + B.O.T.H. = an unexpected, kick ass time.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Christina P.,"CA, CA","Jun 14, 2009","It's a rare event where I consider something being small actually a huge advantage. That is definitely the case with BOTH!!I secretly hope that all of my favorite indie bands play here because you really get a chance to see them up close and personal. It's small, which means it can sometimes get a little cramped, but it also gives you the potential to basically meet the band. It's like nothing else!Dinner & drinks at the Connecticut Yankee down the street is a really good option beforehand!",5
Bottom of the Hill,Denise C.,"San Francisco, CA","Jun 5, 2009",Bottom of the Hill is one of the best small rock music venues in the country. It's cozy and just right. I've seen semi-popular bands and local bands play there. I always feel at home.,5
Bottom of the Hill,Chase C.,"Campbell, CA","May 25, 2009","This place is a fantastic venue to see your favorite bands up close and personal. I usually use a ticket website to get the tickets early, but I bet you could get into even the popular shows right when the doors open. They have a good capacity for a lot of people, and it's a really chill place so you can get up to the front easily if you want. I've seen Liam Finn here twice, once with Laura Veirs and once with The Veils, and both shows were awesome. Good acoustics, neat decor, easy parking, and it's a nice clean place that doesn't stink like some of the bar scenes in SF. The bathrooms are awkward at best to get into and there is little to no seating if you are going there for shows, but that's the only fault I could find. Definitely my favorite venue to see bands at.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Andle G.,"Atlanta, GA","May 14, 2009","The first rock venue I went to in SF.They book great shows and even when it is crowded it's still mangable.  Parking is usually ample!! Good sound, decent cheap food, smoking area in the back for the three of you who still smoke (bad, bad)Cons:  There is a bottle neck between the main area and the bathrooms and merch table.  I have to think this greatly decreases merch sales for bands.  Sad.  The bathrooms are actually usually clean but so tiny and right at the stage (little privacy).",5
Bottom of the Hill,Krystle S.,"Noe Valley, San Francisco, CA","May 11, 2009","Here's the rule: if one of your favorite bands is playing here you buy a ticket immediately.  Done.I don't care if you don't have a crew to go with yet.  I don't care if you're supposed to have dinner with your gf's parents.  I don't care if a gnarly purple dragon is threatening to eat you if you purchase a ticket.The way I look at it, even if I don't make it to the show the ticket was probably only $12-$15 anyways.  Just feel good knowing you threw a little extra cash towards your favorite band.If you do get to go though, you're in for a treat.  The drinks are surprisingly not overpriced, the space is small and intimate, the decor is eclectically cool, and since the tickets were cheap you can buy that concert tee without feeling guilty.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Corey V.,"San Francisco, CA","May 7, 2009","I'm not into music at all and I still think this place is pretty great.  $5 meals, $5 pints, plenty of space as well as an outdoor area and tables to sit at.

Bottom of the Hill,Cesar Thomas V.,"Redwood City, CA","Apr 29, 2009","This is what SF live music scene is all about!  The kind of place where you bump into band members on the floor, or have a drink with at the bar, before or during a show.  So intimate, you can feel the chemistry between band members when they're on stage performing. Great bookings.  Great audio.  If you're a true music lover, how else can you top that? ""Well, how 'bout some booze to go along with that"" you said!? Well, don't you worry. This place is so dive, you'd smell the stench of booze oozing all around its walls. Nice cold taps, whiskeys, even fu-fu drinks if you prefer.  Just ask the friendly bartenders.  So, there you go; inexpensive shows and inexpensive drinks.  Let the good times begin!",5
Bottom of the Hill,Robert S.,"San Mateo, CA","Apr 16, 2009","Nice small event place for local acts. Came here for a an event I designed a flier for.  ""Psycrons"" The drink prices were decent and bout right for a night out. The event was sometime during the week so the place was not too packed but it def packed in toward the end when the main acts were on stage.  So far this place was cool to hang out but was out i the middle of nowhere you pretty much have to be set on going here as there is not much nearbye if you decide to go somewhere else.",3

Bottom of the Hill,Henry Y.,"Palo Alto, CA","Apr 11, 2009","I've been here plenty a time, but finally got around to cooing about it. Saw the band The Homosexuals here recently, at least the current incarnation of that late 70's/early 80's DIY slice of sheer brilliance. Great sound system, nice that they serve food too, the booze isnt' overpriced, and the there's that outdoor area in the back. They've hosted many a great show and I'll keep coming back here for more.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Sara W.,"San Francisco, CA","Apr 9, 2009","This is an awesome place to see live shows and check out new bands. The stage is almost ground level, so you're face to face with the acts. The back patio is nice for breaks in between sets and there is also good (and cheap) beer on tap. Since it's a bit off the beaten track, you tend to get real musicophiles in the crowd too.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Michelle C.,"Petaluma, CA","Apr 7, 2009","I have been here many times to listen to good music. They got me hooked on a band called PUNCHFACE. However, there are not to many seats to sit down and chat w/ friends. Everytime we have been to BOTH we found parking really fast which is good for SF. Overall its one of the best places to check out local bands!",4
Bottom of the Hill,Zach C.,"San Francisco, CA","Apr 7, 2009","Absolutely my favorite venue for shows. I've never been here as just a bar, in fact I have no idea how often they are just a bar. The size and layout of the place all fit the shows I've seen very well. The crowds always seem to be into the artists (they actually are knowledgeable about the music). Favorite venue in SF.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Mace M.,"San Lorenzo, CA","Mar 24, 2009","One of my all time favorite venues.I've seen tons of bands play here, even larger bands, which is awesome in such an intimate setting. The crowds are always great, the bar is even better- especially because I can have a couple drinks without emptying my wallet. I also love going there early and playing pool, or hanging out on the back patio.Oh yeah, and it isn't the sound guy sweetheart, as the saying goes: ""If its too loud, you're too old!""",4
Bottom of the Hill,Javi V.,"San Diego, CA","Mar 19, 2009","Amazing place. It is a sin that I haven't come here before. Just from the beginning, the name and the neon lights are catching you upon entering the street. It is so far from any other source of entertainment, so isolated in its own loneliness, that  the feeling of ""yeah, I am coming here for a reason, it is not that I am wandering around Marina and choosing a random place"" can not be higher.  Then, inside, the crowd is relaxed, the sound is great, the drinks are good and fairly priced (not great selection on beer, though) and there is food.The restroom is a cool piece of art in itself. Sooo ... pick your band (there should be something for your in their calendar) and let's rock at the Bottom of the Hill.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Al I.,"Oakland, CA","Mar 17, 2009","by far my favorite venue in the city. not too big, not too small. the sound is good, cheap drinks, smoking area, and FOOD. parking is easy as well.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Ben H.,"San Francisco, CA","Mar 16, 2009","Cool venue. It is small and you can get a good view of the stage from anywhere. I didnt try the food, but the beer was appropriatly priced. The show I saw was really good, they had both local and non-local bands. The ticket price seemed high, but maybe it is normal, at least it is supporting the smaller bands. I will go back to see some more shows for sure.",3
Bottom of the Hill,Alicia C.,"San Francisco, CA","Mar 9, 2009","I used to go to a show here probably once a month.  Its just small enough that you can see from anywhere, but its usually easy to get close anyway so its a double plus.  Great atmosphere, way easy to find parking.",4
Bottom of the Hill,KC K.,"San Francisco, CA","Mar 2, 2009","Bottom of the Hill is a great venue.  It's large enough to accommodate a good sized crowd, but small enough to keep a personal feel to the event.  The patio outside creates a nice area where you can step away from the loud music and chat. The acoustics in the place are outstanding:  they manage to maintain a good strong powerful sound you can feel in your chest without deliberately raising the volume to ear-piercing levels.  And a mandatory shout out to the band I came to see:  Kinch!",4
Bottom of the Hill,Nikki F.,"San Francisco, CA","Feb 26, 2009","best little venue in the city, where you can still hear a really great little band for under $20, often under $15.  seriously, a rare gem these days.  not sure how they do it, but please, keep doing it.  and thank you.highlights: the Okay, sunset rubdown, a few years ago, and Pela more recently!! so thank you!",5
Bottom of the Hill,Caddy M.,"San Francisco, CA","Feb 25, 2009","I've only been here once, but instantly loved it. Super yelper , Mel V. , brought me here for something she had to do for work, and I was happy with the vibe, the setup and the bartenders! The music that night was an eclectic lineup of indie bands. very different from each other, but all really good. It made me wish I lived in SF, so that I could go to attend more shows. Parking wasn't difficult to find, either. a big plus in the city by the bay e yea!",4
Bottom of the Hill,Carly W.,"San Francisco, CA","Feb 17, 2009","I was invited here by a friend and had no idea what to expect, but left more than satisfied and slightly hearing impaired. The Bottom of the Hill had a very relaxed and laid back atmosphere which I like. It doesn't have all that much seating except for in the back, but you can't see the stage. My friends and I hung out in the back and had a couple of beers and then headed out front when the second opening band came on stage. It was nice to hang out in the back because we had space to move and some of the band members were hanging out back there too. Once we moved out front it was shoulder to shoulder. I definitely liked that the bar was fast. We never had to wait more than a couple of minutes to order. Bottom of the Hill also had drinks in every price range starting at $3 for a beer. I really enjoyed both of the opening bands that played the night that I went, but the sound was off with the main band that played. The mixture between the instruments and vocals with the opening bands was really good, but the instruments in the main band were so loud that I couldn't hear what they were singing and it was killer on the ears. All in all this place was pretty cool and I enjoyed the music. The calendar on the website lists the bands that are playing and the cover charge for that night. Definitely check this place out if you like live bands. Warning: Bottom of the Hill is definitely in the middle of no where, but you can still catch a taxi.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Lan H.,"San Francisco, CA","Feb 16, 2009","The first time I walked into Bottom of the Hill, I was already three beers behind and needed to catch up to friends who had already started the drunken debauchery.We popped our Bottom of the Hill virginity with Loquat and The Frail who were both excellent in concert. The venue itself is small and intimate - so intimate that you can pretty much feel everyone's sweat. Not such a great thing when you're at arm-pit level, as I am, but not so bad when you're listening to good music w/ a G&T in your hand.",4

Can be a little stereotypical to the genre of music that's playing that night but everyone is welcome! I like the underground scene with the occasional headliners stopping by from time to time. PLUS, my car won't get broken into while I'm at the show, that makes me happy.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Angela N.,"Austin, TX","Feb 2, 2009","I've seen two shows here - The Mountain Goats and The Fruit Bats. I like the intimacy of the venue and the sound is pretty decent. One drawback of said intimacy, is, of course, personal space. I have found there is very little here. Great for getting super-to-kinda close to the musicians themselves, not as spectacular when someone annoying is smooshing into you and you're losing ground quickly. Between sets, there's an outdoor sitting area, a back sitting area with booths, and food window area.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Carina N.,"San Francisco, CA","Feb 1, 2009","Yes it's a small venue in the middle of no where, but you come here for the bands and the music.  It's a rather fun place, with a wide range of people from different age.  The bottom line is that it's not trashy.  There's a bar and a place to order food (with a neon sign).  Also some random couches laying around at the back of the stage, a good place to rest up and chat with your friends.  There were plenty of room for us to move around in the crowd when the show is on, and people were dancing like crazy around us.  And you'll also see so many iPhone lite-up faces that were either texting or taking a snapshot on the little stage.",4
Bottom of the Hill,micaela r.,"Oakland, CA","Feb 1, 2009","10 bucks for a few hours of good live music in a small venue is alright by me.  maximum occupancy is 246 (says the sign), so it's pretty intimate.  there's a patio, some old school diner-ish seats in the back for you to chill during set changes, a spot to order food, and a bar.  the only drawback was getting pushed around when we were standing by the ""aisle.""  check the calendar on the website, there's tons of bands going through here all the time.",4

I enjoyed the performers, even though it was not really my type of music. But everyone in the crowd was into it. I loved the drummer in the first act I saw!!! She was just having so much fun playing, it was just a joy watching her play! I think her name was Tina.Thanks Tina!!! Then there was also a lady that can on stage playing the maracas and she was so cool! I didn't understand a word of the singer, but love the two ladies on stage!!!Then the second act, I saw that night, the drummer was so cool too!!! He was totally awesome! His name was Colin. I have to admit I met Colin before at a party, but his playing was just soooooo awesome!!!I would give this place 5 stars, but I got bumped around a little too much. My only complaint.I definitely would come back to this place again.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Sarah V.,"Long Beach, CA","Dec 13, 2008","Last time I was in the city I was lucky enough to catch the Limbeck band playin' this venue.  My friend saw their name floating around somewhere so  I sent out a couple text messages and Patrick was kind enough to put our names on a list to get in.  To be young is to be...poor. So left the jazz bar we were at and headed out to Nowhereville, SF aka Bottom of the Hill around 11pm and had NO issue finding parking.  That is a nice thing.The guy at the front checking i.d.'s was bitter about something or other... and the crowd was a bit awkward too.  But I was all about the small, grungy feel of the place.  Limbeck was playing their ""Delicacy of Living Modestly"" stuff and it was real good.  Despite the weird San Franciscans (no offense) and obscure location, the venue is pretty okay.  I would definitely be down to head back if the right band was playin' there.",3

Bottom of the Hill,Moua L.,"San Francisco, CA","Dec 3, 2008","So here it goes.The place can get crowded for shows, and you will have to wait in a long line for the restroom.  The bartenders don't make the best drinks, but I always have a blast even when its crowded.If there is a show, you will definitely run in to band members.  One time I went there for a show and did not know who the bands were.  My husband and I wanted to play pool, but it was taken. We noticed there was a girl sleeping on the lounge, which took us space to have a seat.  Later, that same girl on the lounge sofa was in the band, 'The Lovermakers' started to perform on stage. It's like this every time. I guess that's what makes it cool.Other bands I've seen here are: The Mayfire, Scissors for lefty, Von Iva, and more.  Crowd is mixed and casual. Perfect for a night of Rock and Roll.",4

Bottom of the Hill,Mike Hawk U.,Bay Area,"Nov 23, 2008","Been going here every now and then for the last couple years. Nice small place where you can really see the bands play and not just see a sea of the back's of people's heads most of the time. I usually go when there's a good post-rock band playing but there are occasional metal bands as well.  No matter what bands I've seen, the crowds are always pretty diverse from my experience (no certain ""scenes"" or whatever dominating the place) and you meet interesting people. Sometimes they'll have some neat publications around, which I read while the next band is setting up. I like how they have self-serving water, you could get dehydrated at shows sometimes (I wish more venues/clubs did this!). Parking is rarely a problem in this part of the city (another plus!). I just noticed for the first time last night that there were a whole bunch of Jesus and Mary stuff when you look up near the ceiling, not sure how long those have been there, I never expected to see that ever so it gives the place a weird charm.  One last note, I'd recommend buying your tickets online asap if a popular band is playing an all ages shows or else you'll be one of those annoying beggars asking everyone in line if they got an extra ticket.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Phyllis Stein 2.,"Genesee County, NY","Nov 14, 2008","This place is the real deal.  I went on a tuesday night and saw a reasonably tight rock band.  I don't know/care what their name was, but the crowd dug it.  The sound was well balanced from every part of the room, and the speakers were tastefully powerful.When I first came to SF and asked around about music venues I should look for work at this place came up so many times.  Even when talking to the owner of Rickshaw Stop, he mentioned that BotH is the kind of venue he aspires to to have RSS become.If that doesn't say enough about this place, you might need to go there yourself next time a band is playing that you've been wanting to see.Also, the beer isn't too pricey, and the bartenders are on their game.",5

Bottom of the Hill,Allyson S.,"San Francisco, CA","Oct 21, 2008","This is by far my favorite place to see live music in the city. Now if only we could convince all those who can sellout the Fillmore and the Warfield to come here and place a few intimate shows. I cry knowing I will never see John Darnielle (The Mountain Goats) perform here again after seeing him so many times (seriously John, why the Fillmore, where is the love?).Anyway, this is a great place to come, even if it's out of your way to go to. It's super intimate, they've got a great outside smoking patio which tends to get very crowded.My advice, if you are coming to a show here, show up early, grab some food in the neighborhood. Your best bets for reasonably priced / fast/ delicious food would be Goat Hill Pizza or Eliza's. The upside to GHP is that you can get slices to go and eat them as you walk down the hill to the venue.Last but not least, come here for shows of bands you don't even know, sit at the bar and talk with the people that work there, they've got great stories if you can catch them when it's not too busy.This place has lot's of SF history",5

I went there tonight to see http://www.myspace.com/thenewup .  They have great upbeat music and they gave a great live performance.  But trying to enjoy music at that club is a lot like trying to enjoy a song being played by a pimped up car stereo driving by you on the street.  It's really sad that the band went through all that work just to have their sound obliterated by the club's jackhammer engineer.

It's also in a so-so ok neighborhood so take a cab if going by foot or public transit or be prepared to watch out for those around you and lock up your car. I've always had good experiences while inside even with staff. I just wish the place was bigger and parking was easier.,4
Bottom of the Hill,Kevin F.,"San Francisco, CA","Aug 5, 2008","this review is for the venue and not for the show.  man alive, if i could give out yelp stars for the live acts, i'd compose two reviews and add up the 10 stars... well, not so much for the pissed pissedofferson opening act but someone needed to get it started.the highlights.  tinsy tiny venue.  fire marshall says 253 allowed, and they must've gotten him stoned out of his gourd to get that high. (not intentional)  i get stoked to get some back and forth banter with the headliners... just one more reason to see it live.  Mike Kinsella (owen is the name of his band and his first car) absolutely rocked in his unique way.  it felt like we, the audience, were on a first date.  nervous chatter coupled with some honest soliloquys created quite an intimate show.... well, except for a few ""d-bags"" in the peanut gallery.  and i can't wait for karmageddon to strike down with great vengeance and furious anger whoever had the effing blackberry buzzing the speakers.  but i digress...like a rookie, i show up dying of hunger, almost 10 hours removed from my last bite to eat.  never fear!  there's a bombing chef (well, he is wearing one of those chef hats) in the kitchen tucked in the arm pit of the building.  the specialty: TACOS!  Que fucking mierda!!!  i almost couldn't finish the two tacos... one would probably satisfy most appetites.  and the cost... $2.50.  Who the fuck gave this place ""$$""?!?it is so cheap that most of the people there paid for the tickets using just two weeks allowance (what is the going rate for allowance these days anyways???)  i was quite bummed that no one shouldertapped me.... but at least i didn't need to decide being a hypocrite or contributing to the delinquency of a minor.when was the last time an entire room broke out in anthem?  well, aside from bon jovi or GnR?  we rocked it like it was 1906.  with rocky votolato pounding the guitar....is it the red wire or the blue wire / just pick one and cut / it just doesn't matter anymore / or did it ever / cause I could never control when the bomb would explode...  download it.  ""suicide medicine""not yet convinced... well, then you probably won't care about the cheap pbr's and the pool table in back for the early birds.  i love a good weekday hangover!!!",5
Bottom of the Hill,Michael O.,"San Francisco, CA","Jul 25, 2008","One of the great virtues of living in San Francisco is the ability to see top-notch live rock shows any night of the week.  (Back in the day, my friends and I would have to drive two hours each way to see bands.  We also used to wear onions on our belts, which was the style at the time--but I digress.)  Now I can walk from my house to see new, exciting music.  You better recognize, SF:  You are spoiled.That said, the BotH should be given some sort of civic honor for consistently hosting the best bands, charging cheap prices for tickets, and serving plentiful and reasonably-priced drinks.  I've seen more of my favorite bands here than anywhere else, many of them for the first time.  The bartenders are nice & efficient...and what the hell is going on on that TV over the bar?!?Bottom of the Hill is the reigning champeen of rock clubs in this town.(Totally minor complaint:  they need to get Bass on tap again--Snakebites don't taste the same with Stella.)",5
Bottom of the Hill,Amy S.,"San Francisco, CA","Jul 20, 2008","Best. Damn. Atmosphere. Ever.No kidding. Even packed with middle-school acting high schoolers ""moshing"" to a ""band"" playing with inflatable lobsters and ridiculous drum machines, I still had an amazing night. It doesn't look like much from the outside -- just a house with lights in a pretty creepy district, but that changes once you get inside. Or outside, because the smoking patio is pretty nice and relaxing.I love the mood here and the bartenders are super-nice. Somehow, they always manage to get the good bands, before the media realises they're good. And twelve dollars for three bands.For an unemployed student, it's perfect. Or someone just looking for a fun night out. JUST MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A RIDE HOME. It's in the middle of f'in nowhere.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Daniel C.,"Redwood City, CA","Jul 1, 2008","The other reviewers sum it up well.Amazingly nice staffSmall, intimate musical venue in the middle of god knows where.Hey Guys! Get a mailing list going so I don't have to check your website for gigs. I'd love to come back! And local beer on tap! Gonna go 5 stars as I had a fantastic evening!

Bottom of the Hill,Patrick B.,"San Francisco, CA","Jun 29, 2008",There are 4 venues in the city that I love going to and this is definitely one of them. Each venue has their own unique qualities that make them special and when it comes to Bottom of the Hill its a small venue with a large personality. I tend to end up here more often then the others because many of the bands I listen to play this venue. If its your first time to Bottom of the Hill you might think its nothing special but after a few visits you will no doubt fall under its spell. Its got that way of making you feel real comfortable like its the home you grew up in and you are visiting for a good home cooked meal in the form of some great bands. The atmosphere of the place is generally made up of people that have been to many shows at Bottom of the Hill and love going to shows in general. The drinks are pretty cheap and the bartenders are always nice and generous with the drinks. The patio in the back is great for relaxing with friends and sitting out some of those bands you might not be into while waiting for the ones you are into. Parking is no problem at all.If you go to a lot of shows in the city then no doubt this place will always be on the top of the list as favorite places to see a band.,5
Bottom of the Hill,Jen Y.,"Oakland, CA","Jun 29, 2008","Besides the location being a little scary on a cold dark night, it's fun once you're inside. It a really raw, ear-pounding, intimate experience to come see bands play at this venue. Depending on the band, it can fill up quick. It's definitely all about the music here. If you're just a couple of high school girls like we were, just make sure you have a ride back home.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Blake D.,"San Francisco, CA","Jun 24, 2008",They just might have the best soundsystem in the city. The people here (employees and patrons alike) are generally great.They get great music from all musical orientations.But... I hate their decor. Oh look that thing on the wall is crooked! AMAZING! That makes me feel like I'm in the middle of a Dali painting! ...or maybe it makes me feel like I'm in a bar that's just trying a little too hard to be hip.,4
Bottom of the Hill,A W.,"San Francisco, CA","Jun 23, 2008","I love this place!Definitely on the top of my list of favorite places to catch a show.The people here are pretty laid back (mid twenties-mid thirties mainly)so no worries about drunken girls or gross guys ...eh, usually.It's small and feels great when it's crowded as other reviewers have said.Nice little bar too!Pitchers of cold water provided by the bar staff w/out having to ask= thank you!",5
Bottom of the Hill,lazslo t.,"San Francisco, CA","Jun 12, 2008","It's the best place to see a show in the city hands down. The sound is great, the bartenders are veterans, and its nice to cool down outside on the patio after rawking out. If you're in a band, however, the backstage is actually just a tiny room upstairs with a couch,  bathroom, and a fridge with some cold beers in it.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Lorrie N.,"Colorado Springs, CO","Jun 11, 2008","Got an email from friend in LA that the band he's in is performing here.  [Maybe, if it's after yoga. Inner thoughts: That's just down the street from my house. ]""We're headlining. On around 11:00pm."" [Inner thoughts: My pretend mental curfew is 10:00pm on school nights.]""Wednesday night. Guest list.""[Oh, well, I might try and bring a friend if I can get them out of bed.]A week goes by...I went.""Hi, ID? Okay, $10 please.""[I should be on the guest list.]""Who's list?""[Friend's list.]""Okay and who's your plus one?""[She is. Inner thoughts: YEAH, friend rocks.]""Okay, thanks.""[Thanks. Inner thoughts: YEAH!]It was a decent show, I think it was a little more mellow than I had thought it would be. Can't even dance to music that mellow. The vocals were great and the band was cool. The band before them was cool too and they were all caravaning together on their tour.Great patio, but only because it was pretty empty. I'm anti-crowd.Decent sized medium venue, no air flow, too hot. There is lots of parking around here and it doesn't feel like a good area because it's pretty dark and mostly industrial. I definitely recommend driving or taxing home at least. People are around outside nearby bars, but our cars were fine. We felt pretty secure.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Kristin Y.,"Raleigh, NC","Jun 10, 2008","it's a fairly small venue, but the sound is really good. i've only been here a few times because i don't often see too many bands that i'm into playing here. my only issue, as this seems to be the common issue for most people, it's kind of a hike to get to. i've done the public transportation thing and i've gone via car; i recommend driving.",3
Bottom of the Hill,Chris M.,"San Francisco, CA","Jun 6, 2008","What an awesome little venue. It fits a few hundred, max, so you get a very cozy feeling with the band even when you're closer to the back. And if things get too crowded, there's a little patio area in back where you can chill and grab a quick smoke... very nice.The only problem is this place is somewhat in the middle of nowhere. No public transport nearby, so you're either taxiing it or someone's DD for the night.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Jay V.,"South San Francisco, CA","Jun 1, 2008","Rockin'... That's all I got to say.Venue is nice and cozy. Doesn't have that grimy, dirty, little hole in the wall feeling even though its kind of on the small side in terms of the main floor, but that doesn't take away from the music and atmosphere. Everything just melds together decoratively. The acoustics is great. The speaker system is up to par in terms of straight up blasting.The neighborhood its in feels very safe. Its kind of in an industrial area so there's not too much around in terms of city folk. Only locals and the fellow fans of the bands playing that night. So I felt safe parking my car outside.Smoking area is in the back and to the left, which leads to an outside area. Rad thing about that is that the outside area is where the main dressing room is for the artists. I was lucky enough to meet the guitarists for Fall of Troy, and Foxy Shazam. Along with the pianist for Foxy Shazam who is a total character himself on stage and in person with his crazy looking beard.Overall, this is a great venue.  Will come here again for another show for sure!",5
Bottom of the Hill,Jen K.,"San Francisco, CA","May 24, 2008","Unpretentious venue where the focus is on the music, as it should be.  It may be small, but it has a lot of heart.  I like small, it lets you get closer to the music, the action, the soul.  Great place to see and support local acts as well as the touring ones.Parking was a breeze! And I felt safe going back to my car after a show when I was alone.  It may not be the best part of the city, but its not the worst.  Be careful of course, but you should be fine.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Armando G.,"Oakland, CA","May 18, 2008",Reminds me of The Empty Bottle back in Chicago. Sound is about average. Crowd is not as diverse as El Rio but still has a good feel. The downside is that there really is not much in the area. You have to drive about 10 minutes just to find a decent restaurant.,4
Bottom of the Hill,Bryan K.,"San Francisco, CA","May 15, 2008","My favorite place to see live music in the bay area. Easy parking, safer-than-expected location, and a cool ambiance. Arrive early for the best view.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Collin S.,"Chicago, IL","May 14, 2008","You WILL NOT find a better location to see a rock show in San Francisco. Small, intimate atmosphere and I've never been witness to a bad show. This place gets national touring independent acts and also supports a lot of local acts. Sound is great, and most of the shows are 21+ Great date idea, especially during Noise Pop",5
Bottom of the Hill,Mike B.,"Oakland, CA","May 6, 2008","This place was awesome! I went to see Dillinger Escape Plan, and security was great. When they realized that we had 2 more tickets, and weren't going to use them, they set us up to sell our tickets to some of the kids freezing outside. The show was sold out, and some kids had been waiting all day. I got to make some kids' day, and they paid for my drinks at the show. We were able to stand RIGHT at the front of the stage, and had an AMAZING time!!! Parking was also unbelievably easy, but I realized later, that it's because I was one of the few 30-somethings there. Apparently, I listen to the same music as most teenage boys. And their moms drove them......",5
Bottom of the Hill,Rachael Autumn R.,"Berkeley, CA","May 3, 2008","I had a great time checking out Audrey Sessions at the hill last night. It's a great venue for what it is. Todd's right, the sound and levels are decent, the crowd is manageable, and at least one of the bands in any given night will rock it out. All in all a fun time!",4
Bottom of the Hill,Ashley B.,"Richmond, VA","Apr 28, 2008","I feel like BOTH is everything I could possibly want out of a small, divey-ish venue.  Nice, cheap beer on tap, decent acoustics, good-sized stage for such a small venue, smokers' patio in the back, a nice mix of local and national acts.  Even the bathrooms aren't too terrible!  This place usually feels really unpretentious, with the staff, the crowd and the kinds of bands that play here and I'm all for that, because the LAST THING THIS EFFING CITY NEEDS is more pretentiousness.But minus just the one star for last night when I went to see XBXRX and my 23 YEAR OLD AND NOT UNDERAGE friend having his REAL AND VALID driver's license turned away because the holograms were a bit off?  REAL anal-sauce* about IDs apparently, because he didn't even know his ID was weird (IF it really is) until last night.They still let him in, they just x-ed his hands.  Which, come to think of it I think he kind of liked because he - TRUE STORY - was actually sxe until just three months ago.  YEAH I KNOW WEIRD RIGHT?*(""anal-sauce""????

Bottom of the Hill,Taj A.,"Los Angeles, CA","Apr 24, 2008","Very Intimate venue, cool staff ( very rare in pretenious SF) and decent sound. For every four shows you attend here, one of them will have the next band that explodes onto VH1 or MTV. I love that when its jam packed, you can just watch the group from the side of the stage. Even when its full it only feels like no more than 100 people. Waaaaaay better than Slim's. Avoid that place. Anyways, from nu metal shows in 96 ( Stuck Mojo) to hipster bands like IAMX in 2007, this place is consistent, a good time, and you def want to get tickets in advance.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Thomas G.,"Washington, DC","Apr 16, 2008","I have only been living in the city for 3 months, and it's possible I've been to this place the most.  They get really good indie acts, I can drink $3 PBRs, and then walk home drunk.  There is also an outdoor patio for smoking.Buy tix in advance though.  Just about every time I went it was sold out, so there were a bunch of people hanging around outside who couldn't get in.",5
Bottom of the Hill,jack w.,"Concord, CA","Apr 14, 2008","Cool club aided by a great  web site.I often will just click on the www site to listen to the linked MySpace bands... play 2-3 songs.. see if I want to go check out any shows that week.  BotH makes it simple to find and support local independent bands.  Bands not controlled by the by the Liberal/ Progressive Big Multinational companies that spew out crap music.  The same music bolstered by the Liberal/ Progressive big media outlets that put these same talentless Liberal/ Progressive bands on the covers of their magazines, and tv shows.  I end up supporting the Liberal/ Progressive bands anyway but at least I don't have to support the whole Liberal/Progressive multinational corporations who give almost all their donations to democrats like Obama and Clinton in order to see some music.Best everday club bay area",5
Bottom of the Hill,Lisa M.,"Fort Lauderdale, FL","Mar 28, 2008","You know there are some songs, or artists that make you feel  like they are singing directly to you? You close your eyes and are magically whisked away to a better place where someone is singing just for you. For me this is Justin Timberlake, Love Stoned, where the song slows down about three minutes in. Anyways...So I've recently been to a place to go and see music that might make you feel the same way. The band I saw was Say Hi to your Mom. They were pretty good. I think that this has so far been my favorite music venue in San Francisco, and I love the Fillmore, so this is a really big complement coming from me. I like this place because its small, but not trashy, the people in there are nice and not pretentious, the bartenders are fast, the cook is the same guy that cooks at Zeitgeist, (did not try the food I imagine it's a fried), the best part is that the stage is right there. You can see and hear every thing that is going on unobstructed, and the acoustics are very good, not too loud, and $10 for a show. Can't complain about that.",5
Bottom of the Hill,scott p.,"San Jose, CA","Mar 26, 2008","Went on a Sat. The performance was great. I brought my friends there to give them a new environment that does not involve music through a DJ but through talented musicians. I got 1 of my friends to go because he has a g/f still under 21 and I told him of this place when they allow underages to come in and enjoy the music. No dress code is needed which I prefer. On one occasion I saw someone bring a cat, so they're animal friendly. When your there, you should also try their hard cider. Alcohol prices are very reasonable. Even though they serve food, you may get lucky with a hot dog stand right outside serving bacon covered hot dogs with grilled onions for only $3.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Kari C.,"San Francisco, CA","Mar 25, 2008","Great shows.  Great sound.  Smoking patio is a nice touch and a good place to bump into people.But JESUS could it be more inconvenient for those of us without cars.  Yeah, the new 3rd street muni is nice until like, 9 PM, and the 22 bus never comes when you need it.

Bottom of the Hill,Cathy T.,"San Francisco, CA","Mar 23, 2008",I once heard a guy tell a story of how he saw The White Stripes here before they were famous and ever since I've faithfully been going to concerts here hoping to see some band right before their big break so I too can be cool and say I saw so and so before they made it big and appeared on Saturday Night Live. Just kidding. Well... not really.,5

Bottom of the Hill,Kurt S.,"San Francisco, CA","Mar 23, 2008","I guess I will be blacklisted forever, but I think Bottom of the Hill pretty much sucks and has only maintained its reputation through having a stronghold on booking some decent acts that all seem pretty bummed when they actually see the place!And WHEN they have decent acts they always manage to get some god-awful openers probably through nepotism-- I have gotten to showing up late for the headliner only after 10 years of painful lessons.  Oh and it is STUPID loud in there.And their negative attitude to the local musicians is so ridiculous, even if you are not a musician I recommend reading their snot-nosed guidelines on their website.  Supportive HA!  Cool--FUCK NO.  If Clear Channel talked like that it would make you sick. Someone else will get an actually cool club going and steal the bookings from this remote, hard to get to, crap hole with attitude.",1

I only rum and cokes but they were good and normal price for the size. Kitchen has been closed for a while I guess so they are trying to get more food back.

So many great memories, like the time we got to meet and hang out with Desa, or the time the lead singer of Tragedy Andy cockblocked me and my friend.  Back outdoor smoker's lounge is much appreciated, if a bit hard to get to when the place is crowded.  The bartenders are some of the nicest, friendliest people I've ever encountered in their service position.  All-ages shows there are great because the lines to the bar are short and you can eye-fuck the ""butterscotch"", as we call it.  One of the last great American rock clubs.",5

It was 1997. Some emo band opened up for them who cried and had a complete sobbing fit on stage. I had never seen anything like it and of course thought the whole thing was a life altering experience. I was so deep back then. (Side note- I purposely didn't wash my hands for a couple days, cause I secretly was into the big black X's on my hands as proof I had gone to a ""show"")..... of trying to climb the walls outside when I was 19 to get into a sold-out Jets to Brazil show and getting some weird black stuff all over my clothes. My friends and I were totally bummed but felt really cool about our story about trying to ""break into the Bottom of the Hill"" and that listening outside was just as cool...... of having some drunk b*#ch pour a pint of beer over my dorky 20 year old black bob w/blunt bangs head during the middle of a Murder City Devils/At the Drive In show. I was totally drenched but my friend insisted on staying through the end since At the Drive In were known for setting their drums on fire. Ten years later and I'm still annoyed she didn't drive my soaked self back to the dorms right then. So humiliating for an up & coming wannabe hipster!.... of crying, yes CRYING(!) while watching Bright Eyes when i was 21. i was that touched.

They have a variety of both 21 + and all-ages shows.  Although, I recommend avoiding the all-ages shows if you can.  I'm not trying to hate on the kiddies, but whenever I go to an all-ages show, I get some 16 year old screaming in my ear and asking for LSD.  Sorry kid.",4

Bottom of the Hill,Stu C.,"Alameda, CA","Feb 22, 2008","Everyone else has basically said all the good things. A good place to come for drinks and kick back, even if you don't know the band that is playing. They have all sorts of different shows here: noisecore like The Locust, acoustic sets, that hip indie stuff with pianos and keyboards, local hip hop, pop punk, horror punk, you name it. Cheap beers, a smoking patio, easy street parking, friendly staff, all ages admittance. Only downside is the tiny bathrooms. And perhaps the tiny dance floor/audience space, which angers the asshole jocks and punks who want to come in there and mosh and slam dance and beat people up. This would normally be a good thing, as they would not have the room to do that stuff, but instead they just get pissed and do it anyway making it even worse since you're in such a small area.",4

Quite the opposite! The crowd was lively but not smothering. Bartenders were friendly all night and it wasn't difficult to get a drink. $4 pints of Anchor Steam, Sierra Nevada, and Big Daddy IPA were less expensive than expected.

The outside smoking area is comfy and the stage is perfect to feel the sweat off your favorite lead singer (or bassist, or guitarist if you prefer) drip on you!The bathrooms are small.

I grew up in a farmtown.2.  John Deere manufactures tractors.3.  Plaid shirts.W took me to a concert at the Bottom of The Hill, and I was expecting it to be a place where the rockabilly's flocked to with their slicked back hair and girls in poofy skirts and ponytails.Not exactly.An eclectic mix of people and a broad age range as well as sexual orientation.  But there definitely had been an update to the old farmhand look I grew up accustomed to.  The trucking hats were still there, as were the plaid shirts and belt buckles, but add in a pair of Clark Kent frames, tattoo sleeves and piercings, and suddenly the look had been updated to young and cool.In addition, the concert was suppose to start at a reasonable hour and when we walked in, the two bulk posts gruffly told us that they were not open yet.  What.  Well, you have the concert posted to open at a specific time and why the heck are the doors open then?   The stage was small but did a good job of holding the band together (saw John Ralston that night, good acoustics and the drummer reminded me of the boy band Hansen, always smiling and had perfect blonde hair) and there is a counter that serves questionable food as well as a bar.  The venue had an outdoors area, which was flanked by a great dense cloud of smoke as well as steps leading to the roof (I assume)I'll be back, if anything, to support musicians.  The acoustics were good as was the crowd (no fights and no pushing) so it was, in all, a good experience!",4

It felt like a living room modified into a venue! Shows sell out quick but thats not problem if you're on top of your game and get your tickets early. More often than not when I went here to check out a band I'd see a lot of members from other popular local bands hanging out here and it's real easy to make friends and network. I haven't been here in years so I don't know how much of it has changed.",5

Bottom of the Hill,Rachel F.,"San Francisco, CA","Jan 13, 2008","I spent my 20's in San Diego. When I check out a new place, I invariably compare it to something similar I experienced in San Diego. When I eat Vietnamese spring rolls, I always compare them to Eric ""Hot Chef""'s rolls at Dao Son. When I come upon a good jukebox, I compare it to the amazingness of the one at the LiveWire. And when I check out live music, I always compare the venue to my first love music venue, the Casbah.Although I feel a little like I'm cheating on my first venue boyfriend, I do live here in San Francisco now, and I feel as though Bottom of the Hill is a good rebound.Bottom of the Hill has a lot of good qualities. First off, it's in the most perfect location ever in Potrero Hill, at least in my opinion. I've never had a hard time finding a place to park if I'm feeling lazy and don't want to walk the 10 blocks from my place. I love love love that 90 degree parking. Even San Diego's Casbah can't beat BOTH's parking ease.The id checker and will-call guy are super friendly instead of having that cooler than thou attitude that seems to persist at many clubs. The sound is pretty awesome in there, thanks in part to its small size and wood walls. There's not a bad place to check out the band, and if by chance the band is not as stellar as one had hoped, there's a pool table at the back to amuse oneself. Even on busy nights, I've never had to wait more than a few minutes for a drink. And maybe it's partly because of the fans of the bands I like, but the girl's bathroom line is mellow, usually entertaining, and never takes forever. And it's directly off the left side of the stage, so you don't have to walk to Egypt and miss out on the band whilst you go. On busy nights it can get downright hot in there, so remember to layer layer layer. But you're San Franciscans so you're used to that.  Casbah, I will always love you, but Bottom of the Hill gets me most nights now.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Andre L.,"Fort Lee, NJ","Jan 12, 2008","I have been to two shows here and I really like this place. Bottom of the Hill reminds of places I used to go when I was in college.  The thing that I like about venues like this place is that you know that the people that are going to these shows are going for the music. The place has a nice feel to it, as you walk in you see the bar and then a nice open floor for dancing, standing or the occasionally skanking or circle pit. It is a great place to hear both local bands and a few bigger bands  that come through. There is a nice little spot outside for smoking if that is your thing and then a space to sit in the back. If there is a band that you like that is there don't miss the chance to come to a great venue. There needs to be more places like this in SF.",5

Bottom of the Hill,Jaye C.,"San Francisco, CA","Jan 6, 2008","I came here to watch Judgment Day with the Botticelli's a few months ago. It's quite a small venue and I truly believe that who ever built this place forgot about the bathroom and just pretty much placed it whereever there was extra space (keep in mind that the space here is already limited). The restroom won't accomodate for more than 2 people just so you know.Upon entering you see the stage.. and yes there's also the dance floor where all these dumb hxc kids kill the mood. Luckily for me that night, I was sitting in the front on top of the ginormous sub woofer and didn't have to fight the rest of the night. Towards the back, past restroom is a pool table and a few couches where you can sit and babysit your alcohol, but it doesn't entirely tune out the deafening music. Alcohol here is pretty basic from what I remember, I recommend pre-drinking so that way none of the lame hxc dancers knock the drink off your hands. FInding parking wasn't as bad as I'd anticipated it to be, but becuase it's located in an obscure place, I couldn't help but wonder if my car had been broken into or not. I like the venue, I just don't like the location.",3

He could have just said ""Are you kidding?"" and given it back, but no. He fucking took it and it was gone. FOREVER. I mean, it was an all ages show so I guess I shouldn't have even tried to use it, and I got drunk there anyways, but it was still a total bummer. That motherfucker. Other than that I actually really liked this venue a lot. It was small so I got to hang out with the bands, there was a generally good vibe (except for the asshole door guy who took my fucking ID), a pool table, a patio, and a nice mosh pit. I saw my favorite band, Skeleton Key, here and ended up taking their drummer to my apartment... too bad I don't remember what we did. Evil, evil drunk.

Bottom of the Hill,Paul B.,"Denver, CO","Nov 29, 2007","I wouldn't say that BotH is the best venue in the city, but it's damned sure a great one.  Years ago, I had only arrived by car, and it was a case of driving down to the bottom of a big-assed hill.  (No irony points for the venue name, I suppose.)  So being currently bicycle-bound and living in the east bay, I was trepidacious about trying to catch a show there.  Turns out, it's not an issue.  If you approach the venue from 7th St, continue for a block on Mississippi, and loop around 17th St, you're there without combating any inclines.  Late-night exodus is just as easy-- 7th St. takes you to Market, where you can catch the all-night 800 AC Transit.",4
Bottom of the Hill,C A.,"San Francisco, CA","Nov 29, 2007","Hands down, best sound in the city. As a performer, the engineer really tailors to your needs.

It's worth it. I always have a good time here.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Veronica W.,"San Rafael, CA","Nov 21, 2007","I've only been here a few times, but I have to say that this has quickly become one of my favorite venues. It's small, which I like; you can actually relate to the music as opposed to it being blasted to you. The bands that come here want the fans/listeners/etc. to feel the music versus the capitalistic drive to sell high-priced tickets. The stage is a little high for this size of a venue, but it kind of works out if you're in the back or stuck behind some insanely tall person. Bar-wise, they have a good selection of beers on tap and make strong drinks, all reasonably priced. Also, the bartenders are attentive and polite, something that I've rarely experienced at such places. In the back is a pool table and there is a patio off to the side where you can smoke. The bathroom is tiny and usually flooded to some extent, but this seems to be the case for every place that has live music. Oh, and because it's out of the way, parking is super easy. Major plus.",5

On special nights, you can sometimes even smell the hops as you walk up to the venue...truly the nectar of the gods.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Jeffrey A.,"Glendale, CA","Oct 23, 2007","Although the stage is unreasonably tall for the size of the venue, this is a great club and has hosted a myriad of bands big and small (but mostly small). Maybe the dramatic stage guarantees short/average height folk like myself a good view though...Really festive decour in the place. One of the walls fuses elements of California architecture with a Dr. Seuss aesthetic. They have that psychadelic window on stage and a smoking courtyard for those who hate themselves. It seems like a really mellow neighborhood so you can park on the street without feeling paranoid, which is crucial since I think this place is pretty far from any parking garage. A great spot to see live music in the city.",4

Bottom of the Hill,Wes M.,"San Francisco, CA","Oct 8, 2007","If bands like Honeycut played here all the time, it would easily be 5 stars.  They walk a masterful line of being hip yet unabashedly fun, retro yet fresh.As for BotH itself, well, I've heard favorable things from so many different people that I think I out-hyped it a bit in my mind.  Not that there's anything wrong with it--it's small, no attitude, and has a funky, cartoon-retro decor (am I the only one who was reminded of a Dick Tracy set?).  All in all it's certainly in the top tier of SF music spots.  But still, it doesn't top Cafe du Nord for that perfect atmosphere.  But there was an added bonus for a tired old man like me: a nice back room with plenty of couch space and a pool table.  I have to confess we sat back here and drank through both of the openers, partly to keep our feet fresh for Honeycut and partly because the openers weren't very good.  There's also a patio to get some fresh air in, which is a nice touch, but for God's sake bring a jacket if you're going out there.Oh, and while I'm admitting to being old, could they have started the show at 9 instead of 10?  I hate it when the headliners don't even start till midnight.",4

Bottom of the Hill,Matt L.,"Gainesville, FL","Sep 26, 2007","I recently went to see my friend's band play at BOTH and I was pleased to see that little has changed with this place since when I used to go a lot more regularly. BOTH is still a stalwart mainstay of SF music. BOTH is the place to see your favorite band. BOTH will not give you fresh breath, however.There is nothing classy about the joint, but it isn't a hell-hole either. The bar is cleverly located near the door and serves cheap drinks as long as you know to stick to the bottom of the shelves (aka BOTS). If you want Kettle One, expect to pay 11 dollars and have the adjacent hipsters snicker at you as you help subsidize the PBR keg. The booking is top notch and somehow manage to get bands that you'd never think would still play at such an ""intimate"" venue. The stage feels close even from the soundboard at the back of the room, but if you want to be off the beat, you can sneak out back for some pool in the back room out have a smoke out on the porch and peer in the artsy peephole of a window to look at the bands' butts.

In my younger days, thank you for letting in my under-aged self to see some of my favourite bands, and in such an intimate venue!  In my older days, thanks so much for having a great bar, the better to indulge myself.I know you're small, but size isn't everything, baby.  It's how you work with what you've got, and you sure know how to work it.  The tiny little stage in the corner is ample enough space for a good sized band to play.  You even serve food, a really great attribute considering that the particular part of Potrero Hill in which you are located has few other dining options without hiking a ways.And your vibe?  Crazy cool, down-to-earth, and welcoming.  I really love when we're together, because I always go home feeling pleased.  It's just that damn 22-Fillmore that puts a damper on my mood sometimes.

Bottom of the Hill,Wendy T.,"Alameda, CA","Sep 2, 2007","I went to my very first concert a couple of nights ago at Bottom of the Hill. Mae was playing (and they were pretty a-MAE-zing, ha.)Parking is pretty easy to find - there's plenty of free street parking on Texas St., although it's on a hill. Since I'm underage, I got the permanent marker X on both my hands and have no experience with the bar. It's pretty much in the middle of nowhere - a deserted lot, some factory-like buildings, and an auto repair shop are nearby. It was a pretty safe area though.The club is TINY, and the stage is even smaller, although that's part of what makes it so great. The atmosphere is very up close and personal, and if you're in the first couple of rows you're close enough to grab the setlist after the show, or even grab the band members (although I would highly advise against that). It's also pretty easy to find the band after the show (depending on how nice the band is). With strategic viewing between heads and taller people, anywhere in the club gives you a good view of the band.The staff is friendly, and they allow bags and cameras, though they do a quick flashlight check before you go in.",5

I guess the only other thing would be to wag a finger at the bar for a couple of very sour whiskey-sours and a tonicky vodka-tonic, which was not expected from $5 well drinks, but I understand they were pretty busy (the place was packed!), and that's what I get for being an alcoholic.

Even for non-pervs such as myself, I still find that this is, hands down (pun intended), the best venue in San Francisco.  What I like:- Small.  Truly a tiny venue, with maybe capacity for a few hundred folks on a packed night.  This means you don't have to deal with throngs of fans and having to watch your favorite indie bands from a pair of binoculars.- Acoustics.  The sound in this place is I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E!- Cheap.  I've never paid more than I think $18 admission.  Beat that, Fillmore!- Intimate.  Clubs like this remind me why I became a fan of indie music in the first place.  This is the kind of place where, after the band plays, usually the band members are there at the back table, selling their cds and schwag to you ($10...way cheaper than most record stores) so they can pay for their beer, or next meal, or transport to their next gig.  Depending on priorities.  The point is.  You can chat them up.  I've met members of some of my favorite bands at shows in places like this:Ester DrangMates of StateDCfC...well, a long time ago.Troubled HubbleLiarsOf Montreal...also, a long time ago.  But still.  Hell yeah.What I don't like.-Claustrophobia.  Jesus F-ing Christ all mighty. (strong words from a Jew).  this place can get so packed, you'll wish you had a cattle prod in your pocket to keep people from smushing (or groping) you.-Parking.  The parking outside sucks.  Plain and simple.  Be prepared to walk, cab, bus, or otherwise NOT have immediate access.The club is small, intimate, well, sometimes intimate, and downright cramped, but it's the kind of place indie bands get their start, and can reach out to the teeming masses of indie-geeks like myself.  5 Stars!",5
Bottom of the Hill,Cat N.,"Oakland, CA","Jul 26, 2007","The lineup is usually good. They book bands there that are difficult to see live otherwise, because they're small. As previously stated, it's a bitch to get to. I tried to take public transportation, but that's dodgy at night. We ended up taking taxis to and from the venue, and that was expensive. I hate that doors and shows are generally so late, so that I have to miss headliners/good bands if I want to get to BART in time to get home. On the website it says happy hour is 4-7, but the show doesn't start until 8.30 at the earliest. What on earth do you do for an hour and a half? It's not very interesting there without the music. They should definitely think about timing more.PS: When I went my first time, for some reason, my name didn't show up on will call and the guy at the register was a total douche about it.

If it is a big show and your worried about it selling out ticketweb only charges you an extra 2.50 and their prices are so low shows are almost always under 20 bucks. The shows are usually 18 over or all age. The stage is rather intimate but the side stage view is more of a walking path. The outdoor smoking are is nice and there is food and a bar. Dont try to sneak your under age friends drinks they will kick you out. Overall great place to see little bands and big indy bands. I even saw polysics there (all the way from japan) defiantly the place to go.,5
Bottom of the Hill,Allan R.,"San Francisco, CA","Jul 11, 2007","I saw my first show in San Francisco here, I think it was Midtown sadly enough. Great vibe, perfect place to see up and coming bands. Other than the Greek/Fillmore can not think of a better place in SF to see a band. I wish more bands I listened to played there, but I don't blame that on the venue more my stylings of music choices has changed.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Lisa T.,"Oakland, CA","Jul 9, 2007","The great paradox of the small music venue:I wish it was bigger, but the fact that it's small is what makes it so great.Just be prepared to squish, squish, squish. You'll have a great time, though; without a doubt. Decently priced, strong drinks. Friendly bartenders, even when they're being barraged and are constantly having to check for wristbands because it's an all-ages show. GREAT back patio. Feeling bold? Head up the stairs out back. That's where you'll find the ""green room,"" per se. My friend and I stumbled upon a gang in gold lame up there Saturday night and realized in our drunken state that they were indeed Gravy Train. We were made to feel most welcome, and proceeded to have a dandy, shiny old time before the show even started. Or maybe you shouldn't try that... Maybe we're just THAT cool that they let us pass. Maybe unbeknown to us, we were being watched the whole time, and surveyed so as to determine whether or not we deserved admission. And we passed... Oh yeah! We're that cool. Good luck with that. But even downstairs with the rest of the average joes, I promise you'll have a good time.Oh, and turns out the night I was here and later wrote this review about... Well... I met my bf on the patio. A good looking, smart, funny, musician/music lover. And he actually CALLED ME.Whaddya know. They have romance at the Hill, too.",4

Bottom of the Hill,Mary R.,"San Jose, CA","Jun 30, 2007","If you're a music fiend and find yourself with a bit of cash to blow and no real plans on a given night, BOTH is a good investment. Lots of great bands trek through here, and if there's 3 bands on the bill, you're almost guaranteed at least one excellent set. Although I like the ambiance, the space itself is awkward: inconvenient pillars block views toward the back of the room, the merch booth is set up in an inconvenient place, and getting to the bar may require a guide and/or path-clearing machete. The space is small enough that (presuming you're not behind a pillar) you'll have a decent view, if not necessarily elbow room--but hey, you're at a show, so leave your personal space issues (and your coat) in the car (which, by the way, is sadly the most convenient way to get here as it's off the major public transport routes.) Oh, and if you're like me and already losing your hearing at a terrifyingly young age, be sure to pack earplugs...it can get hella loud up in there. The sound is perilously good, though, so it can be tempting to leave your 'drums to burst. Your call.",4

I decided not to give up and came the second time to see Adult and Erase Eratta, with the right tickets. Good frickin show!! Except the fact most of SF indie rockers apparently were frigid. How could you go to see Adult and not fuckin dance? Especially after being warmed up with Erase Eratta. Gosh, if your pants not too tight maybe you can move your joints and limbs. Pear Cider for 4.50? Oh well, I can deal with 50 cents difference. The bathroom is so small, I had to pivot. I heard the food was good there but didn't get a chance to try it out. I love the smoking patio section and love the long couch. They were very comfortable and good section just to hang out. I wish they had tables too.

Bottom of the Hill,Lauren F.,"San Diego, CA","Apr 24, 2007","The first show i ever saw at Bottom of the Hill sold me for all future shows to come.  I walked in, got a drink and took a tour of the place.  Walked into the back room by the pool table and pinball machine, and there was a girl there with a button maker.  She didn't work there, she wasn't charging, she was just offering up the use of her awesome machine, and sharing her ability to make buttons.  She had magazines, maps, people were using transfers, and i had a button on my jacket of the neighborhood i grew up in on my jacket for years afterward, only to lose it in a tragic laundry machine accident.  Whenever I looked at that button, BOTH was at the top of my thoughts.This place gets great small and decently sized bands to play, and although its not the most convenient venue in the city, its still worth the trek to Potrero.  With a smoking area out back, and the back area with the pool table, the space is decent, but unfortunately the good acoustics come with standing in front of the stage.  The oddest show I saw there was Captured! By Robots, http://www.capturedbyrobots.com/ , a band made up of one man and his machines.  He has robots playing instruments and during The Wedding Tour, this band rocked out to some of the most popular wedding tunes in their own bizarre way, and then proceeded to marry couples in the audience.  Some bands like the Mountain Goats prefer to play BOTH, but since getting bigger have to move on like all bands eventually do.  It helps that our good friends live upstairs in the house we have actually come to know as the BOTH house, and an evening in Potrero usually means an evening with them.",4

Here's another reason to love SF:  a great small music venue with really good acts.  I'm never lucky enough to catch the bands who have already hit it big and play here surreptiously because, heck, I just don't go out 5 to 7 nights a week the way I did only a few years ago.  (Generally, I had no problem with leaving work at 9 or 10, and then going out.  But then, I had a boss who was tolerant when I rolled in at 9:30 or even 10.  Not so much anymore.  Hence, I'm a much duller girl.    My problem is that even then, and even in college, I had to get close to 8 hours of sleep.  So now, the regular late night forays are histoire.)",4
Bottom of the Hill,Pete J.,"San Francisco, CA","Apr 17, 2007","What I will not do in my Bottom of the Hill review is tell a story about my day, recant a witty conversation I had there once, namedrop some of the staff or complain about the one time the bartender took ten minutes to get me a beer. What I WILL say is that the first show I saw in San Francisco was at the BOTH, & it has since been my favorite small venue in this or any city. Mostly because of the high quality & variety of the acts they bring in on a consistent basis. It is also arguably the least pretentious venue in the city. I've also got friends who live upstairs, & so most shows usually involve good times with said crew.It's not like Bottom of the Hill really needed another review. It's not like anyone but the infamous Lauren S (my esteemed roommate) is going to read this or find it more useful, funnier or cooler than another review. I'm just another dude in a long procession of loyal BOTH concertgoers. And that's what makes this venue so special. Its magic is as much in the quality of the music they bring in as it is in the venue itself. There are no bells & whistles here (Great American Music Hall, what?) -- you will most likely never not feel comfortable at a BOTH show.",5

Bottom of the Hill,Autumn K.,"Helsinki, Finland","Mar 23, 2007","Love this place but it is, unfortunately, at the bottom of the hill. And that equals downright inconvenient to those of us who drink too heavily to drive. Ever. But if you have a friend who is willing to schlep your inebriated ass home after a rockin, raucous night here, or you're generally badass enough to wait for the mirage-like MUNI service to this hood, then this is the place to be. I have never NOT had fun here- the crowd is good people, the music is good, and the drinks are strong. Just make sure you have a way home because this is no place you want to be wandering around, all by your lonesome, with no clear path home, at 2 a.m.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Matthew H.,"Seattle, WA","Mar 22, 2007","Ok, yeah, I totally did it - I subtracted a whole effing star from an otherwise awesome venue because it is in the middle of nowhere, and late at night - after a long show - waiting for the bus in this part of town sucks ass.Of course, if you have a car - then you are in heaven since it is usually really easy to find good, convenient parking out here.  So, if you are automotive-inclined then you are in luck.  Favorite BOTH moments (in no particular order):1.) Performing my only interview during my short lived career as a music critic with the SF band the Pleased (feat. now-producer Noah Georgeson and now solo-artist Joanna Newsom).  During the interview Joanna Newsom told me that she likes to ""knock the boots"" to the Jackson 5.  I thought, and still think, this was a rad answer.  After witnessing this show I developed my first crush in this city (on Joanna Newsom).2.) Seeing indie-rapper Atmosphere perform with a full band including a cover of the Queens of the Stone Age ""Feel Good Hit of the Summer"" but changing the lyrics from drugs to rock-stars (i.e. stuttering out ""Cobain"" instead of ""Cocaine"").  I've always wanted to find a recording of this.3.) Two Gallants stealing the show as the opening band for Rogue Wave: they set up their instruments in the dead center of the crowd - going mostly undetected so that people near the bar and in the back couldn't figure out for the life of them why the rest of us were hushing them.  The clinking of pint glasses added to the music.4) Bribing a door guy at a super sold-out performance by Interpol so that my ticketless friend could walk in with me to enjoy the show.  5) Halloween (my birthday) a few year back drunkenly stumbling in just in time to catch the entirety of Metric's Halloween performance after leaving what, in my mind, was the last great Halloween in the Castro.  Emily Haines became my next ""celebrity"" crush (I always crush on cute indie-rock musicians instead of actresses).Mmmm... I'm totally feeling nostalgic now.  Recently I haven't seen too many shows at BOTH.  I'm not sure if it is because they haven't been scoring as many great acts, or what.  Nonetheless, I'll be watching their calendar, waiting for the next good gig.",4

I've seen most of my favorite bands of all time grace this stage, or I've tried to see from my petite stance, over the throngs of other fans. The beverages are really expensive and everywhere you turn is a wall of people. The bathrooms are ill located in the small hallway next to the stage, the prime area of movement between the dancefloor and outside smoking patio. Behind that is a pool table, even that is always busy. The patio does stellar summer BBQs that are like $5 complete with an afternoon band, those are always good times. The kitchen serves up some good food too and the staff are super nice.",3
Bottom of the Hill,Quinn S.,"San Francisco, CA","Feb 19, 2007","I imagine Bottom of the Hill to be of a design rooted in someone's childhood dreams of the perfect tree house.  To walk into the place is so immediately energizing.  The layout is vast and enticing to the eye, with bar, counters, windows, hallway, and low walls all sweeping you back past the stage and bathrooms toward the little back room and smoking courtyard, with it's forbidden stairs of temptation up to a place where only performers, pretty girls and VIPs dare tread.Tragically, this is the only place in San Francisco I have encountered a mosh pit, and both times, I left a little confused and a little concerned.  I've been hurt in Hartford, beaten in Boston, and assaulted in Albany, but never before have I been the most dangerous guy in the pit.  I can hold my own, but these guys were just feeble.  Is it always like this at punk shows in the Bay?  I really don't mind being a little bit scared for my life once in a while.  It's healthy.The last time I saw the Phenomenauts play at BotH, they must have been hosting a convention for anorexic men.  I'm not exactly brawny, but these guys were just bouncing off of me.  I felt bad that throwing a little weight around could move the whole crowd, but they just kept coming back.  The pit got five stars for spirit and stamina, but a single star for ability and conviction.  I deeply appreciate that you can find a diverse array of local and touring acts at the BotH, and that their ticket prices are totally affordable, as are the drinks.  The courtyard can get really crowded between sets, but it is a great little oasis when you need some time away from the speakers.  If Bottom of the Hill were closer to the heart of the city, it would rank five stars for sure, but then again, it would probably not be able to maintain the character that it has garnered sitting at the edge of civilization.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Dolores A.,"CA, CA","Feb 9, 2007","The best venue around for shows, period, for a few reasons. No matter how damn crowded it is your always nice bartenders will serve you with the quickness. And although it gets super packed and stuffy, you can just go out back and chit chat with your pals through crappy opening bands. ""Did she say chit chat"" you ask? Why yes I did! BC for some magical and mysterious reason, a conversation really can be held out back without screaming over blaring music so the only headache you have the next morning really has to do with how much you drank the night before. While the sound systems here is pretty schizophrenic and it's anybody's guess as to why the headliner sounds horrible and opening band sounds crisp, I'm assuming this is a band equipment issue and not so much the club itself (I admit I know nothing abt PA's and such). Even when packed beyond what you expect it to be, people are cool and down to earth and even NOTICE when you're a midget like moi and will voluntarily move over a bit for ya without you even asking --- major score. I prefer BOTH over the Parkside anyday and bands I know from out of the area do too, often Bottom of the Hill being their only SF booking so I think that says a lot too. But if you like to sit at shows I warn you now it ain't happening my friends.",5

Bottom of the Hill,Dawn B.,"CA, CA","Jan 27, 2007","Here's a funny story: my friend and I actually showed up on time for the show. Too bad the show wasn't on time for us. We looked like major dorks hanging out with our hands all X-ed up just waiting for the first band to start, but if there's any place where people won't give you shit for looking like a dork, it's the Bottom of the Hill. Being Little Susie East Bay I was a little tentative coming here, especially since two girls from our group couldn't come along at the last minute. Upon stepping inside I realized that the uncomfortable public transit journey was well worth it. First off, the staff was pretty friendly, which may not seem like a particularly necessary quality to hardened city people, but for a shy girl like me it makes the whole being underage thing a lot easier. The bartender was cool with holding my winter coat in the back and didn't even get pissed when I realized I'd left my earplugs in the pockets and needed to retrieve them.Aside from the fairly nonjudgmental staff, the atmosphere was relaxed and the decor was cool, blah blah blah. Other reviews suggested I would need earplugs which is why I brought them, but I guess the sound guy hadn't had that many because I found the sound levels quite comfortable. Yeah, I know, I'm going to be hooking up my stereo to my hearing aid when I'm 60.My only gripe would be that this place is seriously in the sticks, and a little unnerving until you get inside. I'd suggest knowing beforehand how you're going to get home. If you don't want to eat there, eat before you make your way down, and take a friend if you've never been there before. Actually, you should take all your friends.",4

The BOTH offers great sound, decent drink prices, an intimate environment, and occasional barbecues on Sunday which offer great food and good bands at an affordable price. There is only one reason that the BOTH doesn't get five stars....Most night clubs can be a gamble when it comes to the quality and level of the sound coming out of its speakers. Be assured, the sound at the BOTH is almost always loud and the mix is almost always good. BOTH is probably the most consistent club for sound quality and mixing in SF.Recently, a friend and I were lamenting the $6.50 whiskeys at a club in the Mission, which led us to the topic of 'which venue in the city has reasonable drink prices.' The BOTH came up and we both agreed. The venue is small- probably only fitting a couple hundred people. This fact makes it that much better when you are seeing bigger national acts or your favorite bands. Sure, you need to squeeze through here and there to get a good view, but in the end, there isn't much space between you and your rock gods- whether you are standing at the back of the club, in front of the stage, or outside smoking. The only reason that I wouldn't give BOTH five stars is the LOCATION. 'Off the beaten path' could be one way to describe the club, but I prefer to say 'a pain in the ass to get to.' In a town that revolves around public transit and taxis to shuttle its people to and fro, you're looking at a major investment of your time and/or money getting to and coming back from the BOTH. This should not discourage you, but warn those who don't already have that expectation.",4

Bottom of the Hill,Evan K.,"Los Angeles, CA","Dec 4, 2006","This is easily the best music venue in San Francisco.  It holds a nice middle ground between bands that are mainstream, and bands that are underground (for those types of shows, try 924 Gilman in Berkeley).All of the musicians I have seen here have been really, really good.  The venue is also really cool, and if you're under 21 you can get a straightedge X on your hand and get in anyway.The only complaint I have is that the volume can get turned up to deafening levels.  I have gone to a lot of small venues in my day that turn up the music loud, but none has been as loud as the first show I went to at Bottom of the Hill (the other shows have been nearly as loud).  Bring earplugs if you value your hearing.",5

Ok, so lots of places have that.

Bottom of the Hill,Con C.,"Seattle, WA","Oct 14, 2006","I love this venue, regardless of the band playing. It's a small place, so that means you're packed in tight and are never far from the band, which is great. Check out the wall listing all the bands who have gigged here on their way up, down, or maintaining their careers; it's truly stunning the range and caliber of the performers. Some things never seem to change- it's still a great place to see cool music and have a good time and major acts play just as much as underground, independent, and hometown wonders that keep the local music scene worth paying attention to. Oh- and the shows are usually cheap. In an era where major acts routinely ask $40.00 and up, up, up for a concert, I'll take my $10.00 show and tell them to polish The Man's shoes, thank you very much.",4

Bottom of the Hill,Chloe S.,"San Francisco, CA","Sep 18, 2006","I hate the 22 and I hate going to B.O.T.H. because I know the 22 will never arrive after a show ends. And for some reason it's always REALLY FUCKING COLD after shows, making the 87 hour wait for the bus feel like, well, 87000 hours. HOWEVER: my favorite bands tend to play here so it's immediately a favorite venue. Beers could be cheaper (god, I couldn't be any cheaper, though) but the girls' room has 2 stalls, which is better than one. Decent smoking patio and decent sized space. Just wish the sound quality was more consistent. One time I smoked pot in the upstairs/backstage, which shortly proved itself to be a baaaaaaaaaaaad idea. I mean, I wasn't *that* drunk beforehand, so I thought it'd be okay. My body plus drinking plus smoking weed equals barf-fest Y2K (I just felt like reminding ya'll of the year 2000, that's all), so I shoulda known better.  Long story short, Jessi called me cab after I officially turned green and I had to hold my face in this extremely unattractive position as a means to to ensure no puking on the ride home. Even though my fare ended up being 10 bucks or so, I gave the dude a twenty because I could not wait for change. After what seemed like a decade, I managed to put the right key (finally) in the lock and let my wasted ass inside my house, where I then proceeded to throw up in the sink and toilet for quite some time. Realizing that my roommate and the band would be at my house any minute, I attempted to stand my sorry ass up to hide in my bedroom. Yeah, no dice. I ended up crawling down the hallway on all fours to my room and passed out, still wearing my shoes and jacket. I remember feeling very worried that the front door would swing open right as I crawled past, totally terrifying Jessi and our friends but being too fucked up to even respond to their horror. Vomit monster. I was.Woke up to barf in my hair and a bunch of sleepy kids in my living room, who busted me out for being a vomit monster. God, I turn myself on.",4

I just checked out Alias and Tarsier here and had a great time. Decent bar, cover at the door tends to be reasonable, and there's a smoking patio out back. No real seating but who needs to sit down when you are busy dancing your ass off in front of the stage? Plus, you can order a corndog at the little food counter. Foods on a stick = perfect snacks to grub on while dancing.

They host everyone from unknown-just-getting-their-start local bands to names that have appeared on MTV!  It's a small brick building in the Potrero District.  Best of all, there is a lot of street parking, just watch the signs because you'll get a ticket or towed if it's a street sweeping night.  We almost got a ticket because we came out just before the street sweeper came around.  Shows end pretty late and it fills up pretty quick.  I like this little tiny venue.",5

The drummer is as close to deity status as i can spatter, and the man has played there six times (he's from the midwest. baffling) without any noticeable complaints, in fact, offering some blustering anecdotes concerning the venue bordering on asinine-but still worth a listen.This place is a model for accidental efficaciousness. It appears as if they are masking corrosion, and thats okay.

Bottom of the Hill,Joel A.,"San Francisco, CA","Aug 7, 2006","A great place to experience indie rock at high decibels. We came here for the first time a couple of weeks ago. Four bands were playing: Tartufi, Dirty on Purpose, Say Hi To Your Mom and Irving. I really enjoyed them all expect Say Hi who were a little too droll for their own good. Dirty on Purpose played a cover and told the audience, ""The first person who can name the original artist wins a CD."" I immediately recognized that they were playing ""Send Me An Angel"" by Real Life. I caught up to one of the band members, George, and he was excited that I had correctly named it. He said he had gotten fifteen incorrect responses. Considering that most of the crowd looked like they were barely legal, it wasn't surprising. My 80's music knowledge finally pays off!

When I saw Dun Gen here, the show was impossible to enjoy because they had to keep adjusting the sound. Usual overpriced bar drinks & what is essentially cafeteria food round this place out, but the venue is still better than Slim's. I really appreciate the back patio because there's nothing worse than going to a show with crappy opening bands and being forced to listen to them! And you know, you can get to the show late but then there is nowhere to stand and every single show I have ever been to has operated on punk rock time, so even if you get there after 10, there's a huge possibilty they're still on local band #1.",4

The interior looks like an old salsa club and it is a rustic place to watch bands that are just making it or great bands past their primeI saw Creeper Lagoon and Earlimart perform here. Both great alternative bands that sound similar to The Breeders, Elliott Smith, and Third Eye Blind.If you've heard of the great Oxford band Ride, their former lead singer performed here recently and if you've heard of the Great North Carolina pop punk band Archers of Loaf, the band's lead singer who is in another band now, performed here.It's a nice hole in the wall and usually, the shows do not sell out here. It's not the Fillmore or the Warfield theatre, where the big gigs are, but it is still well worth going to if you want to see some up and coming Californian and some National and International bands to perform.There is a very good bar and grill place to eat dinner, a block away, called the Yankee Doodle Dandy.",4

The club is tiny and intimate so you can somehow always manage to push your way through the sweaty, drunk crowd to the front row. You can get close enough to practically straddle the amps...or straddle your favorite artist. I saw Her Space Holiday here, and during the opening acts, the singer was watching the music, along with everyone else in the club, instead of pretentiously hanging backstage. It's the same way with all the artists who play here. The dim, musky club atmosphere mixed with the perfect amount of sketchiness from the surrounding neighborhood seems to really bring out the best in the bands who play here. And to top it all off, they allow you in and out privileges for smoke breaks.",5

Bottom of the Hill,Bernie L.,"Portland, OR","Apr 24, 2006","I like the bands that play at Bottom of the Hill. I like the crowd. I like the booze. I like the area. but i just don't like the actual venue. It's a bit cramped, and stuffy. The sound is usually a bit off. and I can't quite get over the fact that the stage is not in the center.
 I know, it's shallow of me.",3
Bottom of the Hill,Ken S.,"San Francisco, CA","Apr 18, 2006","Bottom line...if youve ever been lucky enough to see one of your favorite bands - before they broke - at BOTH, I think youll agree with me...this is, hands down, the best concert venue in SF...Only drawback...getting a cab after a show...BLOWS!",5
Bottom of the Hill,haley d.,"San Francisco, CA","Apr 15, 2006",I've seen quite a few bands play here and I always manage to enjoy myself as well as the music. I like sitting on the shelf on the right. Gives me a good view of all the drunken bastards ruining the lyrics. Good times.,4
Bottom of the Hill,Mike O.,"San Francisco, CA","Apr 1, 2006","I will quote Nicolet K.:
 'They pack the fans into this venue as tightly as David Hasselhoff's speedo... And I wouldn't know first hand, but it probably gets as sweaty and humid as David Hasselhoff's speedo as well.'
 I couldn't have said it better myself.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Elissa D.,"Berkeley, CA","Mar 21, 2006","Boy, SF music venues sure like to pack 'em in. I was here last night for the Art Brut show. It was uncomfortably packed. Reasonably priced beers, but the sound system was pretty awful, our ears were bleeding by the encore. and BEWARE the show was 18 AND OVER! You can imagine the effects of this horrible management decision. Slam dancing??? Seriously??? Oh lord. Lots of parking, that's a rare and wonderful thing. Oh, and the opening act stripped down, pulled out smoked sausages, teared them open with their teeth and ate them. Lovely.",3
Bottom of the Hill,eeeee d.,"San Francisco, CA","Mar 11, 2006","hands down the best live music venue in sf.  great bands, great vibe, outdoor area, tasty food.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Chris W.,"San Jose, CA","Mar 8, 2006",my favorite small club in sf with a constant line-up of great indie bands.  see 'em here first before they get big.,4
Bottom of the Hill,Peter H.,"San Francisco, CA","Mar 7, 2006","small but not cramped, loud but not bleeding ears.",5
Bottom of the Hill,Kerry L.,"San Francisco, CA","Mar 7, 2006",always a fun time even if i don't particularly like the band...there's always the smoking patio...back when i used to smoke...[sigh],5
Bottom of the Hill,Michael N.,"Dunedin, FL","Feb 14, 2006","I love this place.  I used to manage a punk rock band when I lived in Los Angeles and this was the place they always wanted to play in the Bay Area.  Now that I live here I know why.  I have to agree with Michael E. it looks just like Pee Wee Herman's rock venue, but that is what gives it that personal touch.  You can cut lose and not worry about being judged or worse, being kicked out.  If you ever want to see a good rock show, this is the place to be.  I am going to be there this Monday for Presidents Day.  There is going to be three amazing, local, unsigned rock bands playing there.  I hope to see some Yelpers there!",5
Bottom of the Hill,Samantha W.,"Austin, TX","Feb 1, 2006",Evan Dando and I had a 'moment' during his show at Bottom of the Hill. I thank the intimate venue and my memory of every Lemonheads lyric ever written - it was unforgettable.,5
Bottom of the Hill,Taylor P.,"San Francisco, CA","Jan 26, 2006","A venerable San Francisco concert institution, often showcasing bands before they make a crack at bigtime.  Oftentimes you get to experience not one but up to three or more bands in a given night.  What a perfect way to not only see your favorite headliner but to get to see similar music and open up your horizons to other great music.  If you are a smoker, the outdoor patio is a great place to mingle with friends, hipsters, scenesters and even the bands as they make their way back from a performance.  My favorite aspect of the bar -- one of the few locations that you can order both a Guinness and a Strongbow.  Concert + friends + new people + Strongbow = great night.  I always look forward to a show there, only downside is transpo can be a bit sketchy given the remote locale.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Pamela D.,"Tampa, FL","Jan 25, 2006","From what I remember, this seems like a pretty good venue. I wasn't overly excited to be attending a pop-rock concert, but I was suitably pacified by a lot of beer. Good beer, at that. This is a smallish place and therefore you can get 'up close and personal' with the bands. Or you can stand sidestage and drunkenly heckle them, which is what I did. And when you get tired of that, you can migrate towards the back and play pool or air hockey. There are also several soft and cushy benches near the pool table, which come in handy when you are no longer able to stand upright...Oh, hi mom!Beware of the hipsters. If you are one of those disgruntled people who has an irrational dislike towards white-belt wearing youngsters, stay away from Bottom of the Hill or you will become even more disgruntled.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Jordan M.,"San Francisco, CA","Jan 19, 2006",Bottom of the Hill varies quite a bit. I've seen some great shows here when the crowd is small and the band has had proper time to set up. I've also seen shows that have made me move all the way to the back of the room because there are waaaaaaaaaay too many people and someone set the levels to jet-engine-loud.I always manage to get lost on my way to Bottom of the Hill though. It really is in the middle of nowhere and public transit gets you just far enough away to get you lost.,4
Bottom of the Hill,Jessica M.,"Albany, NY","Dec 18, 2005","We drove along some parking lot into what looks like a factory or warehouse neighborhood looking for this place.  As soon as we saw it, everyone in the car gave a collective, ""oooohhhhh.""  Yeah.  It actually is a very humble place where you can find one of the most interesting groups of people; young and old, goth, punk, scenester, emo, blah blah blah.  But we saw this band called the Groovy Ghoulies or something like that and they were a lot of fun.  The atmosphere was a-ok.  Lots of piercings and tats, but a step back into the early 80's.  I think we agreed that we'd go back there.",4
Bottom of the Hill,Young K.,"Santa Monica, CA","Dec 4, 2005","OK.  So the sound system sometimes is off, the noise from people chattering by the entrance can be deafening, it can be unbelievably cramped when a show is sold out, festivities may end at 1 or 2 in the morning (which ain't necessarily a bad thing).  For all of its shortcomings (I'm sure people can and will drum up more), there isn't a better place to see a show in SF.  Bands seem to play their best here, and you won't be far from the stage in this tiny place to miss any of it.  They always book great stuff.  Drinks are pretty cheap.  And the staff have minimal attitude.  Damn, the Wrens were f***ing fantastic on Thursday.",5
