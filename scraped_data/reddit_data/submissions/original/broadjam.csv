,musicians,"Hey y'all - I was wondering about this because I have been getting some requests about licensing my music for ads among other things. I don't really know what to research or where to start. 

From my basic understanding, royalty free is a one-time purchase whereas sync licensing is where you continue to make royalties from it. My music is on Pond5 for royalty free licensing, but I also pitch my music to sync licensing through Broadjam (some of my songs are in one of the libraries I pitched to). 

I usually direct anyone asking for my music to simply purchase from Pond5. But lately I've been wondering if this is a bad approach...Sync licensing seems much more lucrative, and also more official/professional. 

BUT it also feels like directing them to pay for sync licensing would be cheating them from the one time payment option I already have in place on Pond5.

So basically, what I'm wondering is: 

1. Should I even offer royalty free licensing in the first place?
2. Where do you even direct a client for sync licensing? (My music is on BMI.)
3. In what case would you discuss sync licensing vs. royalty free licensing?
4. Are there people who specialize in helping indie musicians with this side of the business? It's just so confusing.

Thanks for any of your help.

Just have a listen and you'll be blown away by Robyn Adams' insightful lyrics, authenticity; and sweet and soulful voice. 

The ""One Chord Song"" couldn't be more profound in this day and age when just about EVERYONE, spends EVERY minute of EVERY DAY acting!  


  


One Chord Song  
Words and Music: Robyn Adams  
Vocals: Robyn Adams  
copyright 2002  


My friend Arno challenged me  
Didn?t know he did it but it still intrigued me  
Write a song using only one chord  
I was on vacation and a little bit bored  
So here goes?  


When I think about who I am and what I?m here for  
It?s a lot like a melody with only one chord  
Who I am is one constant tone  
With life all around me  
It?s my center, my home.  


Now, I may laugh and I may cry and  
I may wonder why children die  
I may scream at the top of my voice  
Drop into depression  
Or jump for joy  
But that?s not me  
That?s not me  
That?s not me, no that?s not me  


Lovers come and lovers go  
The sun shines warm or the cold wind blows  
My day job is rife with stress and I owe money to the IRS  
But that?s not me  
That?s not me  
That?s not me, no that?s not me  


Now, you may think I?m crazy  
And you must have some doubt  
If I?m not who I appear to be, then what am I talking about  
Well that?s the beauty of the human condition  
We all got our own rendition  
But in the end the result is the same  
We?re all playing a great big game.  


When I think about who I am and what I?m here for  
It?s a lot like a melody with only one chord  
It?s a lot like a melody with only one chord  
It?s a lot like a melody with only one chord

,musicpromoscams,"This is a post I have been putting off, but really want to dive into.

For those unaware the sites [Taxi](https://www.taxi.com/), [Broadjam](https://www.broadjam.com/) and [Music X Ray](https://www.musicxray.com/) claim to be able to get your music to top A &amp; R reps of major labels. Film sync supervisors plugged into major productions, radio shows, big blogs, and more.

[I think this Trust Pilot review says it best](https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/5fd6bf0d755dc107e0c2007e), read that if you don't read this. Applies to all three sites.

This is all true, but it's a terribly mis represented truth. Before I go into that, I will admit a great deal of my current success led to the opportunities I found here. The problem is a lack of transparency and awareness of what is needed before wasting thousands of dollars, which I have.

The first harsh reality is that you probably are not as good as you think. I currently produce full time. I am the only person in a city of 400,000 people keyed into the actual industry, working with gold record writers. I still do not consider myself very good.

These three sites basically are a higher end Submit Hub. Which I am also not a fan of for similar reasons. All they want is money, to send your song to whoever you requested. They could care less if you sent a bunch of fart noises. If you pay, they'll send it. That's the core of the problem. There is zero quality control, as most of the money is made from those who shouldn't bother sending music.

The CEO of one of these companies actually told me that people making a six figure income from this type of work, get denied 9/10 times. In other words, a 10% approval rate is standard for people who are the best of the best. That's pretty daunting numbers for someone who isn't a professional.

I've had this confirmed by radio hosts who tell me they deny Five Finger Death Punch spins. The point is regardless how successful you are, get used to being told no, a lot. I mean a lot...A LOT.

Let's say you make $1,200 a month. Submissions on these sites on average are around $15-35 a pop. That's a lot! Per song! Per submission! It can take months to hear back on these as well, if you even do.  Most of the time, you'll be told that the song isn't a good fit. Then they encourage you to send something again.

Now before we keep going, please keep in mind, no, these are not cons. It's just very misleading and over hyped. I had an approval for a ""popular web radio"" to spin my music. Upon getting in contact with them, they revealed that nobody is listening to their radio, and never has been. They tried to recruit me to get them more listeners lol.

They had 50,000 followers on Facebook, and only 200 on insta. 5 on YouTube. They were nobody, and charging people to listen. They admitted to me in private the only income they had was from these sites. I reported them, and absolutely nothing was done, despite this being a clear violation of TOS for all platforms. (It is not supposed to be a form of income, only a way to ensure higher quality submissions/value of time)

Some of the largest players in this will break TOS as well, and deny you, to then hit you up for paid mentorship. Nothing is ever done, as these are some of the biggest names on the platforms that reel in the most fish.

The biggest problem is there is no consistency. You could see a Netflix show needs male country songs, in an old school Johnny Cash, Colter Wall, or Zack Bryan style. Acoustic, live, intimate. To then see the approved song being a female mid 2000s Bonnie Summerville sounding bubble gum pop track.

You can submit for an EDM opportunity that showcases Skrillex as an example, and they will deny your 2011 styled Dubstep for something more like Avicii. (Two very different sounds)

Basically, it's the wild west, and the opportunity can be whatever the person requesting it wants. They will not refund over this. Ironically, if you send something opposite of what's asked for, a provider can blacklist submissions from that account, and often will. ""Please read the description before wasting time and money in submission.""

Most of these ""ears of power"" as I call them are also insane. [In this Taxi music podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jDCjsaac7k) you can hear the CEO of a film sync library make absurd demands that will ""end your career."" I think this is important as it showcases the madness of the industry, and how these sites consider this stuff normal.

Basically, some hot shot music library ceo says if you email him on the weekend, it's unprofessional, and it may get you blacklisted. He says he doesn't want to be bothered by emails on the weekend, I suppose, when he takes time, to, check his emails...on...the weekend? Yikes.

Basically, do they do what they say? Yes. Some of the few wins I had led to a full time career in music without social media. However, you need to be careful. This is not posting to youtube. This is a completely different game, and you need to learn how to play it. They will not teach you. Ya gotta figure it out on your own.

I recommend making a dummy account. Use Privacy payment masking, give it a go, and use what you learn with your own music. Make some tracks as a test. Hire someone. I don't care.

,musicmarketing,"Hello everyone! New here. One of the mods was very helpful in clarifying what kind of content is and is not meant here-- I actually really appreciate it! I'm going to try and follow the rules and post something important to me.   


My name is Isaac, I'm a former E3 presenting game dev turned singer-songwriter. Been doing music full time the last year. Recently I signed four tracks to a Nashville-based song plugger under a one-year non-exclusive contract.   


Something I often tell artists is if you haven't signed anything regarding the rights to the usage of your music, you're missing out! There are so many ways to monetize as an indie without exclusive ownership 360 deals.   


I want to give a quick list of tips on how I did this, and offer some generic insight on how to make it work for you. This is my experience, your mileage may vary.   


1) Admitting my music wasn't sync ready.   
I wasted so much time and money being naive, and not understanding what sync ready even was. Often, I feel this is a common pitfall of a home artist. An easy way to know, is to ask yourself, honestly, if your song played after a top 40 artist would it sound like it belonged there?   


2) Music may be relative, but there's a lot of gatekeeping in the biz, and as awful as it is, learning how to appease what I call ""ears of power"" is a very useful skill set. Research who is listening to music at sync library companies. You can also find a list of artists they've placed, and check them out to see what level they are at.   


3) You can make music for sync that's not for anything else. Look, I'm a singer-songwriter. I make sad boi stuff. But, the music that's made me money, is all pop-heavy Avicii-inspired backing tracks. I do enjoy making these, but I never would have tried, if I only pushed my personal sound.   


4) A lot of sync library companies have strong policies on not contacting them directly. The most recent library I got with, Washing Street Publishing, says so directly on their website. This is quite common. I asked the music supervisor I have spoken with if this includes social media such as Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and email, and the answer is yes.   


5) I used BroadJam for that specific placement. I'm not the biggest fan of it or other sites like it. The CEO of Braodjam told me sync licence success is 1/10, meaning a failure rate of 90% is what people who make a full time living this way deal with. so don't take a ""no"" too personally.   


6) Monetize being told no. Because of BraodJam, Butch Vig, the producer of Nirvana, Green Day, and The Foo fighters told me he liked my song Rewind. Said it sounded like Wake Me Up When September Ends. The amount of paid producing jobs I got name dropping his praise is staggering. If you're creative, you can make any aspect of this work to your advantage.   


7) Be patient. I went into this thinking only my song mattered. It isn't so. A five-time gold record hit songwriter for Garth Brooks said 1 out of 300 of his songs get licenced out, and he doesn't know what makes a potential hit get the greenlight. It's more a game of waiting to be told yes, than your music being worthy. I don't know why but just stick with it.   


My advice isn't law of the land, but please do your research and have realistic expectations. Music syncs do not pay much. National ads can be as low as $500 or so. A Netflix film can be anywhere from $2-5000. Don't quit your job after getting approval--- often a greenlight can change suddenly. I've had 25 approvals, and only 2 placements so far. Just how it goes.   


If you're building income streams it's a wonderful tool. Just give it some time to stick!

On Bigger Licensing Deals
One of the most sought-after deals is to be represented by a big licensing company like Bank Robber Music or Ocean Park Music Group. Most of these deals are made by having the right team on your side and being associated one of the label, management or legal teams these licensing companies work with. Instead of soliciting to a big licensing company with your music, work hard on attracting a great team to your music. It will be much easier to get in their door.
There are many smaller licensing firms who will make small, non-exclusive deals with you and submit you for placements with music supervisors. Many of these contracts are easy to negotiate and very standard. These smaller licensing companies can often be the start to a relationship that will take you to a larger music licensing deal and more placements. Don’t be close-minded to smaller licensing deals. They can be the first step to bigger things.

,audioengineering,"Hey, so an Artist i listen to had certain songs uploaded to a website named ""Broadjam"" back in the early 2000's before Youtube, this was before he was known and just something he did to get noticed, He is a Singer/Rapper/Producer/ engineer ect he has a Platinum Plaque, he does everything.

And i was just wondering, do u think that he kept the stems to the songs? i mean he does not strike me as the type or person to just delete shit like that, but in 2011 he made a mixtape of songs for his fans because the label he was on was not letting him release music at  the current time, so he just put some old unreleased songs onto it, and he put maybe 1 or 2 of those old songs i've mentioned earlier, but the files where in such shit quality, almost as if he just found any copy he could of the songs because he did not have ANY of the stems to re-master them or even any original Wavs.


It just bothers me, he never really talks about those songs, but they were great, and i've always wanted to have the Instrumentals or any stems, he self released them back then before he was known so he still has every right to them.

So just of what i have told you about this artist do u think he still has all his stems from his old stuff? and how do i ask him to listen to it, i want to ask him to buy them from him for like $4000 or something stupid so he would actually consider, but i dont want to sound like i want to buy the rights, i just want to listen to the files",,,,0.0,,Question for Any of you,,,False,,,,,,False,,False,,,,,,,{},,,,,,,,,{},,,0,,,,self,False,,,,,True,,,,,,,,self.audioengineering,,,,,,,False,,,,False,,,,True,False,False,,,,,,,t5_2qkby,,,,,62tw9s,,,HollywoodundeadRares,,2,,,False,,,,/r/audioengineering/comments/62tw9s/question_for_any_of_you/,,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/62tw9s/question_for_any_of_you/,,1491065528,,,,,,,,1494549913.0,,,,,,True,,,,broadjam
,WeAreTheMusicMakers,"Good evening, i've combed this page a few times for great threads and finally worked up the courage to make an account to seek guidance as i've read alot of great insight here but nothing that realllllly hit what i wanted to know.

Basically, i run an indie label of my own and while we've made some great strides over the years i want to break into more streams of income and promotion now that i finally feel my team is ready to take on more, i would like to get a better grasp on whats currently ""working"" in terms of music licensing and song placements

Cdbaby Licensing with rumblefish sounded o.k  but i do distribution with distrokid quite happily and i cant tap into their licensing services without uploading music on cdbaby for what i feel is a inefficient price model for how i run my business and using both would in the long just be extra expense just for a micro-licensing deal (unless i hear that deal is worth it).

Getty images music seems like a ripoff and a half simply because they KNOW they have what seems to be the most success stories with placements

I've had music dealers for over a year and havent heard a peep (i mean maybe our music is just horrible but 3 artist with 10 - 15 songs each and not even a single email in 14 months?)

Im not looking for an easy answer or a singular one I just want to hear from people more experienced than myself what companies are good to start getting a feel for procuring song placements, i would love a sync licensing equivalent to ""distrokid"" but the dragonballs can only be gathered once a year, im cool with the non exclusivev 50/50 models as i want to use them not so much for the money but the exposure, i'd gladly use my own music to test the waters but i need to be pointed in the right direction firsr or atleast tips on how to work music dealers a bit more in my favor

[Great app undrtone. Just signed up. My question: how do you organize your music? Use Itunes? Other apps? Playlists? Examples of playlist names?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/38jo41/i_am_scott_vener_music_supervisor_for_entourage/crvl4h0?context=5)|Im the worst at organizing my music. but for the most part I use Itunes. Because of my job I still buy music. I need the files to edit with.  I am constantly making folders with playlists. But They are mostly job related. Example, if im working on an acura commercial or patron commercial. I just throw in a bunch of songs that I know would work then it just sits there ha.

But I gave it a ""first listen"" scan and think its amazing. Wavybone is a jam.  Also diggin MAX B.  Kendricks album is tough for synchs bc he is so lyrical.

,Songwriters,"The SongDoor 2014 International Songwriting Competition is now open for submissions. Awards totaling more than $41,000 will be given to entrants in six categories. Complete information is available at http://songdoor.com.

“Last year was our biggest ever,” said SongDoor president, Tony Zotta. “We want to continue growing, so we always add something new each year. This year, it’s ‘uVote.’ From January 8-20, 2015, anyone can listen to and vote for their favorite finalist song. The writer of the winning song will receive $500 cash. You can vote for your own song, so you, your friends and family will also have a chance to win that money for you if you enter a song that makes it to the finals.“

All entrants will receive $120 worth of free songwriting tools, which includes a full-access 45-day trial from SongU.com (valued at $49.95), plus music editing software which is valued at $79.95. No special membership is required and anyone 16 or older may enter. The entry fee remains at $10 per song, which is what it was in 2006 when SongDoor launched.

This year's competition is in partnership with SongU.com, 16 Ton Studio, Hard Twist Music-BMI, MasterWriter, Broadjam, Herringbone Studio and author Robin Frederick, and runs through November 15, 2014. Last year's Grand Award winners Justin Froese and Nancy Montgomery (both from WA) won with their crossover Christian hit, “Finally Here.”

Our judges are back again this year: Nancy Moran, Joe Beck, Bill Shore, Jason Blume, Dennis Winters and Steve Avedis. Two Grammy® nominations, a #1 Europe chart hit, a wildly successful national tour and a Top 10 Billboard Country hit are among just a few accomplishments of the SongDoor judges last year alone.

Entrants are eligible to win the Grand Award, which includes a single-song publishing contract with Hard Twist Music-BMI (owned by mega-hit songwriter Bill Shore), a full-band private session demo at 16 Ton Studio, a one-year full-access membership to SongU.com, a copy of MasterWriter 3.0 songwriting software, a full membership to Broadjam and an autographed copy of Robin Frederick’s best-selling songwriting book for film and TV. Six Category Winners each receive a valuable package of awards, including a top-shelf guitar or vocal studio demo produced at Herringbone Studio, and memberships to both SongU.com and Broadjam.

Songs may be entered in six different categories: Christian, Country, Pop, Hard Rock/Alternative Rock, Soft Rock/Singer-Songwriter and Instrumental. Entries are accepted online or by mail through November 15, 2014.
