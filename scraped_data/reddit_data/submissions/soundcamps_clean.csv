13gimll,1683987065.0,MusicPromotion,Intelligent-Leopard7,Best Spotify Promotion Methods?,"Hey Guys!

Hope you doin well. I'm independent musician for more than 7 years. You already know how it's such a trouble to promote your own music as independent musicians. I had this problem as well but this issue really start to get so much annoying for me. In deep Im about to give it up.

Let me write you which Spotify promotion &amp; marketing methods I've tried so far.

1- Google ads - Obviously useless for musician

2- Ig Ads - Better than google but not effective again

3- Playlist Promotion website: Like soundcampaign, playlist push I almost spend more than 1.000 dolar on that website. Yeahh they put your song some organic playlist but maybe we gain about 10k stream totally. 1.000 dolar for 1.000 stream this is insane as I said. These are nice websites but for price and gain really I don't think people can work with these website more than 1

4- Tiktok influencer: Full of bot. For my last release I worked with 10 micro-influencer total 10m people watch these video but thats all! Even not small move to stream

5- Purchase Bot Streams: All musicians &amp; independent record labels around me talk about [Spotifypanel.com](https://Spotifypanel.com) for last 1 years which they always use their bot stream services to boost their spotify streams. As I know or heard lots of biggest world start using their services as well. We all know that these was not the solution in the long term or can hurt our profile. I make some try about 10 dolar. believe me or not but these plays has better outcome for me when I compare to other costly way. But This is just 10 dolar order Im'm not sure that you can build all your career on bot plays.

Shortly I need your advise guys :) Really gladly appreciate all your advice.

I'm a music curator on Spotify, I own a large network of playlists and I've been working as curator on platforms such as Submithub, Playlister Club, Groover... 

Well, I used to work on Soundcampaign for a while and I noticed many things:

\- They don't have any filter for the artists / music, most of the music I received sounded like a produced just opened a DAW for the 1st time, which means they're not going to be picked by us and the platform is literally taking their money.

\- As curators, the 1st point I explained means that we're the 'bad' guys from the artist perspective, so we can get negative reviews from the artists.

\- Then comes Soundcampaign and say your 'reviews' aren't being good enough (which are very extended and well developed, never had any complaint on Submithub for example) and they use that excuse to avoid paying us for our work.

So, the point is: Soundcampaing is a complete SCAM, for both artists and curators.

The playlists owner answered me that my song didn't fit in their playlist, and for a while I was able to watch at their playlist from a link in the backend (they removed this link after my first complain) and in a playlist (for example) tagged as CELTIC ROCK there were bands like COLDPLAY, BRUNO MARS, ONE DIRECTION, BEYONCE, MAROON5.

o17cla,1623856827.0,soundcampaign,Alan_Greenspin,"The SoundCampaign Saga, Spamming and Doxxing and Fraud, oh my!","Here is some background as to why this whole subreddit exists.

Long ago, I created a Spotify playlist of songs to accompany the Fallout universe of games. They were all from 1949-1961 and my list clearly indicated that. Predictably my email address was scraped from the playlist and sold as marketing lists to record labels and artists (who wanted their songs on lists) and once the torrent of emails came in I removed all of my contact information from every list.

I was diligent in unsubscribing or blocking the wave of emails from this brief time (nearly 2 years ago) and the torrent of emails turned into a trickle.

Thursday, March 27th 2021 I received the 2nd email in a row from a representative from SoundCampaign. He sent me the usual followup email that any beginner salesman has used.

&gt;Hi there,  
&gt;  
&gt;I haven’t received a reply about the mail I sent to you a few days ago.I assume that you might be very busy and may have forgotten to check it, so I thought to follow-up.  
&gt;  
&gt;Have you taken a look at it yet? I look forward to your reply.  
&gt;  
&gt;Kind regards,REDACTEDArtists Management at SoundCampaign

I replied back that I would like to unsubscribe, and that they needed to have an unsubscribe option on their emails in the future if they wanted to appear to be a legitimate business. I received another email from this person the following day, and requested to be unsubscribed again.

I received this response:

&gt;As stated before, the internet does not work in that way. As a lawyer, I fully know what I am talking about. No need for any explanations from your side.  
&gt;  
&gt;You are not on any mailing list, by the way. However, you won 't receive any other communications.

&gt;Best,  
&gt;  
&gt;REDACTEDArtists Department Manager at SoundCampaign

Odd. I hadn't had my email in my Spotify for 2 years and, yet, this person had apparently magically guessed my email. The fact that my playlist was clearly not modern music was apparently irrelevant - he just HAD to get in touch with me. I wasn't buying it.

Irritated, I decided to look at their website and found that they very proudly listed a TrustPilot page with a 4.4/5 rating. Impressive! What was even more impressive was their Instagram, which had only ever posted 4 times and had 19K followers.

&amp;#x200B;

I checked to make sure I was eligible to submit a review on TrustPilot (I was) and then posted my negative interaction with this guy.

Within a few hours I received an email from SoundCampaign again. A new guy this time! A Customer Support Specialist.

&gt;I hope you are doing well. This is REDACTED, a Customer Support Specialist at SoundCampaign.   
&gt;  
&gt;I am sending you this email because a few days ago you wrote a 1-star review about SoundCampaign on TrustPilot and you were asked to provide your information. However, we could not find the email address you provided on our database.   
&gt;  
&gt;I would like to kindly ask you to provide me with the email address you used to register on SoundCampaign so that we can stop sending you emails that you do not want to receive and also to see about the possibility that you can delete the review in order to avoid misunderstandings with our artists.  
&gt;  
&gt;I also apologize for any misunderstandings that may have occurred with mailings in the past and hope that we can talk to resolve this.   
&gt;  
&gt;I look forward to hearing from you.

One thing I can say positive about SoundCampaign is that their tone is almost always exceedingly polite! I emailed this new guy back and let him know that I do not have an email address with them because of his coworker repeatedly emailing me in spite of being asked to stop. I also requested to no longer receive email from SoundCampaign. This is my third time to request it.

He replied back fairly quickly.

&gt;Thank you so much for your response.  
&gt;  
&gt;We understand the situation and apologize for any inconveniences again.However, as you have stated, you are not a customer of ours, therefore it is not appropriate to provide a review based on an inexistent customer experience. Trustpilot is meant for customers that have acquired a service.Moreover, you are currently not -and you have never been- on a mailing list. Your email was public on Spotify and this is how my colleagues could contact you. We will never contact you again as we understand that you do not want to receive emails from us.  
&gt;  
&gt;We kindly ask you to voluntarily remove your review in order to avoid misunderstandings with our artists. 

Hmm. This new guy #2 seems to know what he's talking about! I'd better check the trustpilot page, maybe I'm remembering the rules wrong.

Well no, clearly that's wrong. Guy #2 must be mistaken. I let him know about the Trustpilot Guidelines and asked him again to please stop messaging me.

I heard nothing from SoundCampaign for a couple of days. It was quiet. Then I received a notice from TrustPilot - my review had been flagged. I needed to provide all of my interactions with Guy #1 and Guy #2, which I happily provided, along with another review covering my interactions with Guy #2.

Basically as soon as my second review hit, an old friend re-appeared. Guy #1 sent me a new email, but... it wasn't with all the other emails. It sure looked like his email address, though! Upon closer inspection, guy #1 has a domain for his list spamming ([soundcmps.com](https://soundcmps.com)) and one for his actual work email ([soundcampaign.com](https://soundcampaign.com)) so as to not get their intra-office communications blacklisted at the major spam houses. Smart!

&gt;From the very beginning we have been completely respectful and have had no issue with you not wanting to be part of our curators network.  
&gt;  
&gt;My colleague REDACTED #2 just kindly invited you to remove your review as, once again, you are not a real customer.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, don't worry. We will kindly proceed and escalate the case to get the needed rectifications done.   
&gt;  
&gt;Have an amazing day!

Both of my reviews were flagged at this point, and I provided all of the contact information once again to TrustPilot.

I put in a support request to TrustPilot to let them know that SoundCampaign was continuing to email me and was flagging legitimate reviews as fraudulent.

I spoke to Spotify regarding SoundCampaign emailing me in regards to my Spotify playlist and received this response.

&gt;Thank you for sharing these details, we sincerely appreciate this.  
&gt;  
&gt;We filed an internal report on this website and on their activities to let the right people in Spotify investigate this further and take all the necessary actions against them. At the same time, let us recommend to report this scam to the proper authorities.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks again for your cooperation. Let us know if you have any other questions.

&gt;All the best,Escalations Team - Spotify Customer Support

Sadly, my local authorities couldn't do much about spam email coming from - where was this company?

A quick search of SoundCampaign's website listed an address in Israel. I ran the address through Google and it was, in fact, just a WeWork. Thankfully, Guy #1 had provided his full name and a quick search revealed that he was from Barranquilla, a town in Colombia.

I shared my frustration with SoundCampaign on my personal networks on LinkedIn and Facebook. I searched Reddit and discovered that my good 'friend' Guy #1 was active on Reddit and was quick to strike down any notions that SoundCampaign was anything less than legitimate. I let another commenter know that SoundCampaign was spamming playlist owners with offers, and Guy #1 **doxxed me on Reddit.**

That's fine. Two can play at that game. I made another post, and another, until every mention of SoundCampaign I could find featured my wonderful experience with SoundCampaign.

This made Guy #1 very angry.

The emails started slow at first. A newsletter called 'NextDraft', one called 'LifeEdited' and the BBC all suddenly had requests from my email address to be signed up. Wish, Healthline, GetSiteControl, another newsletter called 'Brain Pickings' all suddenly had signups from what appeared to be me. I suspected the wonderful staff at SoundCampaign, but couldn't prove anything definitively.

Not until Guy #1 messed up and started to submit forms on his competitor's sites to waste both my time and theirs.

I received an email from a nice person at iBoostU, who responded with the contents of a submitted form, including the IP address from which the form was submitted. A quick search:

&amp;#x200B;

[Direct identifying information blurred out.](https://preview.redd.it/kykky8zs8n571.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea2d2dd6eb7ea0deaa47999a75f7b1c66c4b416f)

Barranquilla. That sounded familiar. Of course, this is where Guy #1 is from.

I copied Guy #1 on the email I received from the iBoostU guy and included the CEO of SoundCampaign on the email.

The CEO told me he would do an investigation of what Guy #1 was doing, but in the meantime he would like me to remove my negative reviews. Clever. I told him that I'd take them down when his 'investigation' was complete. I never heard from him again. I was signed up for a new newsletter the next day. And the next day.

My TrustPilot reviews are regularly flagged by SoundCampaign and I have to provide them all the information every time they flag it or the review will be pulled down after 3 days. I realized that this is why SoundCampaign's reviews seem to be so overwhelmingly positive - they harass those who post negative reviews until they are removed.

So that is why this sub exists - to document the continued harassment by SoundCampaign and to share the negative reviews that are either flagged and deleted or bullied off the internet by the staff of SoundCampaign.",1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/soundcampaign/comments/o17cla/the_soundcampaign_saga_spamming_and_doxxing_and/,"The SoundCampaign Saga, Spamming and Doxxing and Fraud, oh my!","the soundcampaign saga, spamming and doxxing and fraud, oh my!","Here is some background as to why this whole subreddit exists.

My TrustPilot reviews are regularly flagged by SoundCampaign and I have to provide them all the information every time they flag it or the review will be pulled down after 3 days. I realized that this is why SoundCampaign's reviews seem to be so overwhelmingly positive - they harass those who post negative reviews until they are removed. So that is why this sub exists - to document the continued harassment by SoundCampaign and to share the negative reviews that are either flagged and deleted or bullied off the internet by the staff of SoundCampaign.","here is some background as to why this whole subreddit exists. long ago, i created a spotify playlist of songs to accompany the fallout universe of games. they were all from 1949-1961 and my list clearly indicated that. predictably my email address was scraped from the playlist and sold as marketing lists to record labels and artists (who wanted their songs on lists) and once the torrent of emails came in i removed all of my contact information from every list. i was diligent in unsubscribing or blocking the wave of emails from this brief time (nearly 2 years ago) and the torrent of emails turned into a trickle. thursday, march 27th 2021 i received the 2nd email in a row from a representative from soundcampaign. he sent me the usual followup email that any beginner salesman has used. >hi there,   >   >i haven’t received a reply about the mail i sent to you a few days ago.i assume that you might be very busy and may have forgotten to check it, so i thought to follow-up.   >   >have you taken a look at it yet? i look forward to your reply.   >   >kind regards,redactedartists management at soundcampaign i replied back that i would like to unsubscribe, and that they needed to have an unsubscribe option on their emails in the future if they wanted to appear to be a legitimate business. i received another email from this person the following day, and requested to be unsubscribed again. i received this response >as stated before, the internet does not work in that way. as a lawyer, i fully know what i am talking about. no need for any explanations from your side.   >   >you are not on any mailing list, by the way. however, you won 't receive any other communications.   >   >best,   >   >redactedartists department manager at soundcampaign odd. i hadn't had my email in my spotify for 2 years and, yet, this person had apparently magically guessed my email. the fact that my playlist was clearly not modern music was apparently irrelevant - he just had to get in touch with me. i wasn't buying it. irritated, i decided to look at their website and found that they very proudly listed a trustpilot page with a 4.4/5 rating. impressive! what was even more impressive was their instagram, which had only ever posted 4 times and had 19k followers. &x200b; i checked to make sure i was eligible to submit a review on trustpilot (i was) and then posted my negative interaction with this guy. within a few hours i received an email from soundcampaign again. a new guy this time! a customer support specialist. >i hope you are doing well. this is redacted, a customer support specialist at soundcampaign.    >   >i am sending you this email because a few days ago you wrote a 1-star review about soundcampaign on trustpilot and you were asked to provide your information. however, we could not find the email address you provided on our database.    >   >i would like to kindly ask you to provide me with the email address you used to register on soundcampaign so that we can stop sending you emails that you do not want to receive and also to see about the possibility that you can delete the review in order to avoid misunderstandings with our artists.   >   >i also apologize for any misunderstandings that may have occurred with mailings in the past and hope that we can talk to resolve this.    >   >i look forward to hearing from you. one thing i can say positive about soundcampaign is that their tone is almost always exceedingly polite! i emailed this new guy back and let him know that i do not have an email address with them because of his coworker repeatedly emailing me in spite of being asked to stop. i also requested to no longer receive email from soundcampaign. this is my third time to request it. he replied back fairly quickly. >thank you so much for your response.   >   >we understand the situation and apologize for any inconveniences again.however, as you have stated, you are not a customer of ours, therefore it is not appropriate to provide a review based on an inexistent customer experience. trustpilot is meant for customers that have acquired a service.moreover, you are currently not -and you have never been- on a mailing list. your email was public on spotify and this is how my colleagues could contact you. we will never contact you again as we understand that you do not want to receive emails from us.   >   >we kindly ask you to voluntarily remove your review in order to avoid misunderstandings with our artists.  hmm. this new guy 2 seems to know what he's talking about! i'd better check the trustpilot page, maybe i'm remembering the rules wrong. well no, clearly that's wrong. guy 2 must be mistaken. i let him know about the trustpilot guidelines and asked him again to please stop messaging me. i heard nothing from soundcampaign for a couple of days. it was quiet. then i received a notice from trustpilot - my review had been flagged. i needed to provide all of my interactions with guy 1 and guy 2, which i happily provided, along with another review covering my interactions with guy 2. basically as soon as my second review hit, an old friend re-appeared. guy 1 sent me a new email, but... it wasn't with all the other emails. it sure looked like his email address, though! upon closer inspection, guy 1 has a domain for his list spamming (soundcmps.com( and one for his actual work email (soundcampaign.com( so as to not get their intra-office communications blacklisted at the major spam houses. smart! >from the very beginning we have been completely respectful and have had no issue with you not wanting to be part of our curators network.   >   >my colleague redacted 2 just kindly invited you to remove your review as, once again, you are not a real customer.   >   >however, don't worry. we will kindly proceed and escalate the case to get the needed rectifications done.    >   >have an amazing day!   >   >best,   >   >redactedartists department manager at soundcampaign both of my reviews were flagged at this point, and i provided all of the contact information once again to trustpilot. i put in a support request to trustpilot to let them know that soundcampaign was continuing to email me and was flagging legitimate reviews as fraudulent. i spoke to spotify regarding soundcampaign emailing me in regards to my spotify playlist and received this response. >thank you for sharing these details, we sincerely appreciate this.   >   >we filed an internal report on this website and on their activities to let the right people in spotify investigate this further and take all the necessary actions against them. at the same time, let us recommend to report this scam to the proper authorities.   >   >thanks again for your cooperation. let us know if you have any other questions.   >   >all the best,escalations team - spotify customer support sadly, my local authorities couldn't do much about spam email coming from - where was this company? a quick search of soundcampaign's website listed an address in israel. i ran the address through google and it was, in fact, just a wework. thankfully, guy 1 had provided his full name and a quick search revealed that he was from barranquilla, a town in colombia. i shared my frustration with soundcampaign on my personal networks on linkedin and facebook. i searched reddit and discovered that my good 'friend' guy 1 was active on reddit and was quick to strike down any notions that soundcampaign was anything less than legitimate. i let another commenter know that soundcampaign was spamming playlist owners with offers, and guy 1 **doxxed me on reddit.** that's fine. two can play at that game. i made another post, and another, until every mention of soundcampaign i could find featured my wonderful experience with soundcampaign. this made guy 1 very angry. the emails started slow at first. a newsletter called 'nextdraft', one called 'lifeedited' and the bbc all suddenly had requests from my email address to be signed up. wish, healthline, getsitecontrol, another newsletter called 'brain pickings' all suddenly had signups from what appeared to be me. i suspected the wonderful staff at soundcampaign, but couldn't prove anything definitively. not until guy 1 messed up and started to submit forms on his competitor's sites to waste both my time and theirs. i received an email from a nice person at iboostu, who responded with the contents of a submitted form, including the ip address from which the form was submitted. a quick search &x200b; direct identifying information blurred out.( barranquilla. that sounded familiar. of course, this is where guy 1 is from. i copied guy 1 on the email i received from the iboostu guy and included the ceo of soundcampaign on the email. the ceo told me he would do an investigation of what guy 1 was doing, but in the meantime he would like me to remove my negative reviews. clever. i told him that i'd take them down when his 'investigation' was complete. i never heard from him again. i was signed up for a new newsletter the next day. and the next day. my trustpilot reviews are regularly flagged by soundcampaign and i have to provide them all the information every time they flag it or the review will be pulled down after 3 days. i realized that this is why soundcampaign's reviews seem to be so overwhelmingly positive - they harass those who post negative reviews until they are removed. so that is why this sub exists - to document the continued harassment by soundcampaign and to share the negative reviews that are either flagged and deleted or bullied off the internet by the staff of soundcampaign.",10,1658

If you really want to dig-in, find some sites that you can check curators, their lists, genre diversity etc. There're lots of them.  


In s.c. ; you dont even know who just listened your song &amp; album :)  


Summary for the S.C. ''campaign'' :  


Paid 90 USD for potencially 14k listeners (according to s.c). Result: Not even 30! Added 3 playlists also (all p.lists have min 600 followers). So, i don't think these playlists alive enough :)  


I can easily say that, it's not a living area. They need to change their business set but i don't think they 'll. Anyway s.c. is continuing to earn money :)

NEW INFO :  
I read their answer (down below). Another quick summary for you:  


There 're 2 variables for the campaign's price:  


1. Curator numbers  
2. ''Potencially'' playlist follower numbers  


Also there were 2 option for my budget:  


1. 56 USD for 6 curators and nearly 5000 playlist followers  
2. 90 USD for 6 curators and nearly 14000 playlist followers.  


So they 're using ''POTENCIALLY'' PLAYLIST FOLLOWER NUMBERS for campaign price. But after a unsuccesfull result, repeating this: ''We're not selling streams. ''  


Yes, we know that and it's not the point.  


If the follower numbers and the campaign result have not any connection, STOP SELLING IT, it's misleading.

m51043,1615746999.0,edmproduction,alfiealfiealfie,Well this is supremely annoying...,"This post concerns anyone daft enough to pitch your EDM song to playlist curators using pitching services. 

For anyone commenting blah blah we told you so; I know so. I am stupid. Please don't make my mistakes. Forewarned is warned etc or whatever the phrase is.

I think playlist [placement is a waste of time](https://najinsan.wordpress.com/2021/02/15/i-paid-for-spotify-playlist-placements-so-you-dont-have-to/), but that's another story.

There are various services that connect the producer with the curator and for a fee you can pitch their track to them. Prices vary massively so Submit hub it's anything from $0 to $3 and Soundcampaign it's anything up to $15 per pitch.

It's the latter service I'm warning folks about. I recently pitched to 12 curators, got accepted to 7 playlists with a cumulative reach of about 16k. Fast forward 2 weeks and my total streams is 290. I paid $160 for the privilege. That works out about 55 cents per stream. FML

But it somehow gets worse!
Of those 7 playlists the song was added, it has been removed from 4 at some point in the last 2 weeks. Of the remaining 3, 2 have yet to yield any streams and the remaining has produced....3 streams. 

But wait! There's more!
One of the playlists that accepted me had the curious distinction of not only removing the track after a few days but also yielded approximately 0 streams anyway. Its so funny I could cry!

I'd treat the integrity of playlists in platforms like Soundcampaign as extreme high risk and I think folks need to know that.

I'm not commenting about Submithub bc Jason will probably pitch in here. I like it there but for different reasons.

Finally, to reiterate, this is just a reflection of my desperation to get a few plays. And the fault is mine for not using better routes to build a fan base.

I recently pitched to 12 curators, got accepted to 7 playlists with a cumulative reach of about 16k. Fast forward 2 weeks and my total streams is 290. I paid $160 for the privilege. That works out about 55 cents per stream. FML But it somehow gets worse! Of those 7 playlists the song was added, it has been removed from 4 at some point in the last 2 weeks. Of the remaining 3, 2 have yet to yield any streams and the remaining has produced....3 streams.  But wait! There's more! One of the playlists that accepted me had the curious distinction of not only removing the track after a few days but also yielded approximately 0 streams anyway. Its so funny I could cry! I'd treat the integrity of playlists in platforms like Soundcampaign as extreme high risk and I think folks need to know that. I'm not commenting about Submithub bc Jason will probably pitch in here. I like it there but for different reasons. Finally, to reiterate, this is just a reflection of my desperation to get a few plays. And the fault is mine for not using better routes to build a fan base.

Some of you will already know this and be all like ""we told you so, you idiot"" in which case I am just reinforcing key findings. The findings also apply to my experience. Caveat emptor.

**Here's what I found out**
* Paying for pitching services such as Submithib, Groover and Soundcampaign works and you can increase your monthly streams on Spotify. I increased mine from 0 to about 2k
* The increase in streams does not translate at all well to followers. I gained maybe 20 followers.
* The success rates of different platforms varies wildly. Submithub approval rate was much less than Soundcampaigns.
* There are factors that dictate how many streams a playlist will refer. These are: track position on playlist, time on playlist, number of likes the playlist has. Before you submit to a playlist check how often it is updated. You want ones with *less updates*
* It is not worth submitting to Instagram influencers - the posts are too transient and short lived in my experience
* Submithub's Hot or Not function is incredibly useful in giving you objective feedback, if not a little honest at times. It was also useful at interacting with record labels.",3,0.58,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/lkh5nm/i_paid_for_spotify_promotion_so_you_dont_have_to/,I paid for Spotify promotion so you don't have to,i paid for spotify promotion so you don't have to,"I've written a long blog post here about it all here( but I'm summarising here so you don't have to go anywhere.

I had several playlists I created using my own music taste and some of them got popular.

My popular playlists under spam by ""report abuse"" bots, which are triggered by jealous playlist curators probably, for around 2 years.

Yesterday I got attacked again. I fixed the playlist data, and this morning I was shocked when I couldn't log in to my account. After a while I received an email that says:

&gt;""Notice under Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use  
&gt;  
&gt;The Terms expressly prohibit users from selling a user account or playlist, or otherwise accepting or offering to accept any compensation, financial or otherwise, to influence the content included on an account or playlist or the name of an account or playlist. It has come to Spotify’s attention that your account has engaged in unauthorized use in violation of the Terms. Spotify has therefore suspended your access to the Service and initiated a thorough review of the unauthorized activities.""

First, how do you know that I sell my playlists? How can you detect it?

Secondly, there are websites that make this explicitly already. Why don't Spotify stop them then? e.g soundcampaign, soundcamps.

I contacted customer services via live chat several times. They redirect me to someone from ""Escalations team"". The guy from the team immediately ended the chat several times. Then I talked to someone else, and he said I will receive an email about it. I contacted again using the given conversation id, but at that time escalations, the team staff said they don't have any information to share and they can't help. They also did say this is not something customer service can help with. So who can help me? I contacted u/SpotifyCares on Twitter many times, and they are basically ignoring me.  


I just want my account back. Is there anything else I can do? My account can be accessed by anyone still. In the worst case, I would want to remove the account completely!

I ran a campaign on Soundcamps and I'm very happy with the results. More than 30 of around 50 curators who listened to my track added it to their playlist. All in all, I've gained around 5,000 plays in one month, which is quite good for me (I was basically at 0 before).

o15f5j,1623851613.0,soundcampaign,Alan_Greenspin,"A real SoundCampaign review, #2:"," **Would not recommend - read my experience**

I would not recommend SoundCamps for those looking for true ""organic"" promotion.  


From my own experience, here is my reasoning.  


1. My genre of music (e.g. bedroom pop) I selected when I submitted the song, seemed to be sent to playlist curators of a completely different genre. One of the reviews I received said something like ""I wish I had a bedroom pop playlist"". After emailing with customer service, this seemed to be just an excuse for not reviewing the song.  


2. Playlists can be full of bots. My song was put into a playlist of over 22k follower and I strongly believe these were mainly bots (you can tell using Chartmetric and Spotify for Artists). The bots have IP addresses from about 5 major cities in the USA, Mexico etc. Almost everyone in the playlist has the same top city of Mexico City.  
This may seem like your song growing an audience but the truth is the steams are fake, it hurts your Spotify algorithm, as the song will be recommended to the wrong users (with random preferences of genre) and puts you at risk of being taken down by Spotify. Not to mention getting blacklisted from Spotify editorial playlists.  


3. After contacting Spotify for Artists regarding the latter, they advised me to ""\[review all\] promotional and marketing efforts"".  


4. Be aware that the ""Artist Protection Program"" only refunds money as credit in your account, so you are forced to spend it with them again. This leaves you in a bad situation if the curator does not review your song, which happened to me almost straight after ordering.  


5. The reviews I received had poor grammar/spelling, seemed very generic, and had poor attention to detail. I understand this is a worldwide service with users of different nationalities but this was not really good enough.  


6. I raised my issues with customer service, and instead of taking action to request (but not force, as I know they cannot do this) that the curator removes my song from the bot playlist, they asked me to pay for more of their 'services', at a discounted rate - I found this insulting. They have not offered any alternative way to help solve things.  


I do not want to spend more money, I want support and for the company to rectify for the service I already bought.  


In conclusion, SoundCamps makes no promises about the streams you will get, which makes it seem a better and safer option, and is why I chose them. But in my experience, curators ignored my song and didn't review it, I was added to a playlist of bots that ruins my statistics and reduces chances of growing, and I lost money where curators left a low effort review or no review at all.",1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/soundcampaign/comments/o15f5j/a_real_soundcampaign_review_2/,"A real SoundCampaign review, 2","a real soundcampaign review, 2"," **Would not recommend - read my experience** I would not recommend SoundCamps for those looking for true ""organic"" promotion.

(I know I know, wandering around is the best, but there may be some spots people don't consider going to).

Places I love:
1) Hardly at 4:30 and A(need to confirm for 2016)- well I camp there for one and consider it one of the best Bars on the Playa. It's a 24 hour shot Bar with a dance floor out front and a lot of fun events.
2) Golden Cafe at the BR French Quarter 7:30ish and B?- really awesome daytime bar with good live music. I think I saw Seth Rogan there, but well you know...
3) Barbie Death Camp (7:30ish)- just awesome
4) Thunderdome 4:00 and Esplanade- Master Blaster says EMBARGO! Just killer to watch beautiful people bash each other with Nerf
5) Distrikt 9:00 and G- one of my favorite daytime soundcamps. Bike parking is stoopid and there is piss everywhere but I love it anyway. Killer, wonderful bunch of people.
6)Ride on the Robot Heart- find it and try to climb aboard or just hang out and watch....whatever, it's all good. I love a lot of their DJ's.
7) Mayan Warrior Art Car- just fantastic
8) HOTD near Rods Road- Another really cool bar. Runs 24 hours, lots of fun.
9) Pink Mammoth- Great DJs and dranks. Daytime party.
10) Bubbles and Bass- just reminds me of the scene where Dumbo ties one on.
11) Daft Punk Annual Party out in the  Deep Playa strait out from the temple most of the way out to the trash fence. BeTs drop at sundown on Wednesday. Do not miss this one brohs.
12) I'll keep adding as I remember things but please all throw out props for your favorite things to do.
13) Strap one on at the Black Rock Roller Disco
14) Make out with a like minded individual on the Ferris Wheel. Its terrifying, and someone will eventually die, but oh what a ride.
15) Grab your sack and ride on the slip and slide thingies

TLDR- post your favorite camps or things to do.

jxjiq,1314584282.0,BurningMan,isodvs,Looking for last minute Burning Man ticket to gift!,"A good buddy and campmate of mine wasn't able to get the money for his ticket this year and has been kinda down on his luck, so I am hoping to surprise him with one but haven't get been able to find any yet. If anyone has one available in Reno or are able to ship, I'd gladly pay face value and would be forever grateful, as would my buddy. 

I'll be playing sets at most of the major soundcamps this year so if you want some dubs or lessons or something, I'd gladly throw something extra into the deal! :D
