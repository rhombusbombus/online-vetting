1akm9xz,1707257447.0,musicmarketing,NoName22415,General Question - Where should I spend money on promotion?,"Hello,  
New to this community, I did read through the commonly asked questions and still just wanted to get a feel for others' experiences out there. I have a band, fairly newly formed, but has kind of built a small amount of momentum.   
We do all the self promotion stuff, have used submithub and submitlink, gone through the tedious processes of finding playlist curators and reaching out directly, all that stuff, basically if it can be done for free, we have and continue to do it.  
Personally, I do not like submithub or submitlink, and it has a lot to do with our music. We do reggae rock, and often the feedback is overwhelmingly positive, but we are either too heavy or not heavy enough to be appropriate for playlists, though we have gotten onto a few pretty good ones - its just not nearly the success rate that would make me want to continue to throw funds at these sites.   


The majority of our plays now come from spotify radio, which is nice, but we really want to see what we can do to push it to another level.   


We have a song releasing March 1st, and I am contemplating using Spotify Marquee, but there is so much conflicting information online. I have also heard good things about groover and haven't tried it, same with Playlist push.   


What have your experiences been? Have any of these services shown actual positive results for you? Did you go a different route and possibly hire a marketing team, and if so, how did that go? I am willing to look into any and all possibilities, but there can be absolutely NO BOTS in any method we use.

 I'll start with the good aspects of Groover: 
• it’s cheap (as it should be).
• “sound experts” are usually professional engineers and producers so they give good constructive feedback in terms of quality and technical stuff. 
• Some curators (not many) are very kind and try to fit the song in any suitable playlist they have even if your stuff is from a specific niche. 

Now, bad aspects of groover:
• its full of people that don’t really know anything about music. (This is bad for anyone that doesn’t make pop or tiktok music)
• Lots of “journalists” and “curators” give very poor feedback and it seems like they dont even listen to the songs.
• All the “indie” or “pro-independent artist” type of users, those are the worst. If you aren’t a copycat of The Strokes, Mac Demarco, etc then avoid pitching to those curators.

183szf1,1700944851.0,edmproduction,Facts-and-Logic-999,Help decoding dumb feedback from Submithub curators,"Okay, so I released this dubstep tune a few weeks ago, not my first time around the block, but I would describe my production skills overall as decent but not great. Upon the release, I sent my track to about 15 or so blog/playlist curators on Submithub and Groover and it was unanimously rejected across the board.  Can't say I'm terribly surprised based on my experience in the scene so far, but I am a bit caught off guard and frustrated by the feedback that I got, and what I understand to be dubstep-industry-isms that just don't really make sense to me. 

I'm actually very open to feedback and using it to improve my skills and music quality, but in order for me to do that, it has to actually make sense. So therefore, I'm wondering if someone could help translate dubstep-gatekeeper-speak into plain english for me? I'll list some of the feedback points I got in order from most stupid to least stupid:

&amp;#x200B;

1. ""It sounds like you're using too many presets""

Well that's funny, because I'm literally not using any. I might have used some pads or something from Omnisphere or Kontakt in the background, but all the basses/leads/arps etc. are created by me from scratch 95% of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. ""Your sounds sound too old""

Old? I made them all for this track and have never used any of them before. I've not listened to every dubstep track in existence, but I don't know of any other tracks that have used these exact sounds. I'm sure there are examples of similar sounds out there, but it's not like I'm ripping off any particular track or artist.

&amp;#x200B;

3. ""Your mix/master has problems""

I literally hired a professional engineer to mix and master it, but ok.

&amp;#x200B;

4. ""Your drop isn't loud enough""

By ""not loud enough"" I'm assuming they mean ""not compressed enough"", because if you look at the waveform of the track, there's really not much if any headroom left in there during the drop. My engineer and I had tried further compressing the bass group, but it ended up sounding messy and distorted, so we opted for only moderate compression on the bass sounds. I guess this the closest to a valid point of the things listed here, but it's hard for me to picture an average listener going through a playlist and saying ""eww sounds like this producer didn't use enough sausage fattner on their basses"", especially considering how many boring/uncreative tracks are on those same playlists.

&amp;#x200B;

So what is going on here? Clearly I'm in the dark about some things, so please enlighten me. Thanks.

16vlazy,1696016649.0,musicmarketing,lilboss049,The Truth About Groover,"Let me start by saying that I am a pop artist that has been focused on growing an organic fan base over the last year. I have been releasing 1 new song every 5 weeks so that I am always pushing out content and feeding the Spotify algorithm. With each new release, I promote the song for 5 weeks. I use Instagram Ads, Facebook Ads, and playlist pitching (SubmitHub and Groover). I have grown my IG from 500 to over 3k. I average at least 10k monthly listeners on Spotify and have over 200k total streams across 12 releases. I am even starting to grow at a steady pace on Apple Music just off of my ads campaign. So I'm not HUGE or anything, but I would consider myself as starting to become established. My music has high quality mixing, high quality production (I hire a professional producer on SoundBetter), and is professionally mastered. So, naturally, my music has a professional feel to it and it is something I'm proud of. So why then, does Groover troll me? Let me explain. 

Initially, I really liked Groover, mostly because it has a HUGE curator base. But after using Groover for over 1 year, I am finally convinced that 90% of the curators on this site are just trying to get paid. Why do I say this? Because, although my music sounds ""professional and on par with the industry standard,"" my song is almost NEVER added to playlists on Groover. Let me show you some screenshots:

Keep in mind that this song is a Pop Ballad with a Rap in Verse 2. So it's a Pop/Rap song with like a Marshmello type beat. It sounds very similar to something Juice Wrld, The Kid Laroi, JB, Post Malone or Halsey might put out. It is a sad song about how hard it is to let someone go with a very catchy hook, and again professionally mixed, mastered, lined up, and produced. All of these curators proceed to tell me the exact same thing. Then tell me that it's not a fit for their playlist. I go to their playlist and guess who's on their playlists. Juice Wrld, Post, Kid, JB, etc. It's honestly all a load of crap. ""Your song is AMAZING, well produced, sounds professional, but we aren't gonna add it. Thanks send us your next track."" This has been my experience with Groover for the last year. So for those of you out there who are trying to get your music out there, just be very careful here. In my opinion, the owner of the site needs to clean this up.

So, naturally, my music has a professional feel to it and it is something I'm proud of. So why then, does Groover troll me? Let me explain.  Initially, I really liked Groover, mostly because it has a HUGE curator base. But after using Groover for over 1 year, I am finally convinced that 90% of the curators on this site are just trying to get paid. Why do I say this? Because, although my music sounds ""professional and on par with the industry standard,"" my song is almost NEVER added to playlists on Groover. Let me show you some screenshots &x200B; Keep in mind that this song is a Pop Ballad with a Rap in Verse 2. So it's a Pop/Rap song with like a Marshmello type beat. It sounds very similar to something Juice Wrld, The Kid Laroi, JB, Post Malone or Halsey might put out. It is a sad song about how hard it is to let someone go with a very catchy hook, and again professionally mixed, mastered, lined up, and produced. All of these curators proceed to tell me the exact same thing. Then tell me that it's not a fit for their playlist. I go to their playlist and guess who's on their playlists. Juice Wrld, Post, Kid, JB, etc. It's honestly all a load of crap. ""Your song is AMAZING, well produced, sounds professional, but we aren't gonna add it. Thanks send us your next track."" This has been my experience with Groover for the last year. So for those of you out there who are trying to get your music out there, just be very careful here. In my opinion, the owner of the site needs to clean this up. I have already spent THOUSANDS of dollars on this website, and yet I get WAY better exposure just running my own ads.","let me start by saying that i am a pop artist that has been focused on growing an organic fan base over the last year. i have been releasing 1 new song every 5 weeks so that i am always pushing out content and feeding the spotify algorithm. with each new release, i promote the song for 5 weeks. i use instagram ads, facebook ads, and playlist pitching (submithub and groover). i have grown my ig from 500 to over 3k. i average at least 10k monthly listeners on spotify and have over 200k total streams across 12 releases. i am even starting to grow at a steady pace on apple music just off of my ads campaign. so i'm not huge or anything, but i would consider myself as starting to become established. my music has high quality mixing, high quality production (i hire a professional producer on soundbetter), and is professionally mastered. so, naturally, my music has a professional feel to it and it is something i'm proud of. so why then, does groover troll me? let me explain.  initially, i really liked groover, mostly because it has a huge curator base. but after using groover for over 1 year, i am finally convinced that 90% of the curators on this site are just trying to get paid. why do i say this? because, although my music sounds ""professional and on par with the industry standard,"" my song is almost never added to playlists on groover. let me show you some screenshots &x200b; keep in mind that this song is a pop ballad with a rap in verse 2. so it's a pop/rap song with like a marshmello type beat. it sounds very similar to something juice wrld, the kid laroi, jb, post malone or halsey might put out. it is a sad song about how hard it is to let someone go with a very catchy hook, and again professionally mixed, mastered, lined up, and produced. all of these curators proceed to tell me the exact same thing. then tell me that it's not a fit for their playlist. i go to their playlist and guess who's on their playlists. juice wrld, post, kid, jb, etc. it's honestly all a load of crap.

16tbpq5,1695791865.0,musicmarketing,oldjack,Groover is trash,"(1) The website itself is terrible. After you search, you have to click on a curator to see whether they have 17,000 Spotify followers or 42 or 0. This forces you to click back and forth constantly. There is no way to sort by followers so you waste time checking if anyone is even worth your money.

(2) Curators misrepresent their interests. They claim they want multiple genres of music and then reject you because they only accept one specific genre. This is an obvious bait-and-switch designed to get your money. Or they broadly claim they want artists that sound like ""Post Malone"", ""Radiohead"", ""Blink 182"", ""Kendrick Lamar"", and ""Tame Impala""...wtf is this? And the curators that actually have focused interests have zero following so they're worthless.

(3) The technical feedback proves the curators are clueless. I'm totally ok if someone simply doesn't like the style of my song. But when some unqualified curator says ""the vocals are too low in the mix"" when they objectively aren't, or the guitars ""have too much compression"" when they're not compressed, it shows these people are just pretending to sound knowledgeable. One curator even suggested our singer should sing in a completely different style-- as if an established band with published music is gonna change their sound for one random person. Totally illogical feedback.

To be clear, I've had songs accepted and rejected on Groover, Submithub, and Daily Playlists. I've got reasonable feedback and dumb feedback on all three as well.

He offers us paid campaigns worth between 800 and 1200 euros (radio only or online and radio combined, single only or whole album/EP).

He wanted to start right away next week, but we put the brakes on for now, because we are not technically ready for a campaign of this scale yet, e.g. we don't have professional photos yet, no website etc.... .

We were hit by a big feedback and share wave last week due to some successful groover campaigns with some very good blogposts and we still have to get used to the new reality.

Does anyone have experience with such campaigns here? I asked him if he could send us a contract in advance, but he said, for example, that he would only send only an invoice if we book the campaign.

15afew7,1690400131.0,musicmarketing,conversebasin,Where to Start with Label Partnerships,"Hello, I'm having trouble figuring out where to start with labels. I'm on pace to finish 50 songs this year in the indie pop/rock/electronic genres. Strayed away quite a bit from my DJ roots as I evolve as an artist.

I could prolly do more songs, but I have a full-time job and am doing an undergrad voice program at Berklee. Also, the songs have to be written, practiced, and recorded. One song a week is quite a bit of work to actually finish.

Thankfully, I am working with a pro producer, so my role as the artist is mainly singing and songwriting.

My question is, where do I start with finding a label to partner with? Should I release singles, should I just submit all of them to labels and let them be broken up into wherever they go, should I form 3 albums out of them?

It seems there are 3 distinct types of songs (indiepop, indierock, and indietronica), so could do 3 albums, but I don't know of a label to talk to who would be interested in 3 albums. Labels are all about singles, but my projects tell a story, and I think should be released together.

Any ideas where to start besides labelradar, submithub, or groover?

Is it best to just put them all out as singles, let them all spread their wings in different directions, like a pack of butterflies? That might be a bit chaotic, but it sure would plant a lot of seeds.

I was having a browse and couldn't find a recent playlist submission thread. In short, I'm a fairly new artist, have released three songs and my album drops in a month. 

I'm wondering if anyone has some advice on getting heard regarding playlist submissions - I feel getting on many playlists is the best way to branch out. 

The three I'm considering paying for are **submit hub, musosoup** and **Groover.** Just to add, I have used **dailyplaylists** and think it is great.

\- They don't have any filter for the artists / music, most of the music I received sounded like a produced just opened a DAW for the 1st time, which means they're not going to be picked by us and the platform is literally taking their money.

\- As curators, the 1st point I explained means that we're the 'bad' guys from the artist perspective, so we can get negative reviews from the artists.

\- Then comes Soundcampaign and say your 'reviews' aren't being good enough (which are very extended and well developed, never had any complaint on Submithub for example) and they use that excuse to avoid paying us for our work.

n34vjc,1619956345.0,musicmarketing,hazechatos,Playlists: the best way to reach new fans?,"Hi guys,

I’m currently preparing my next release. I put lot of efforts in this single, but also some money on the artwork and mastering (paying for these two was totally new to me). So I’ve focused on making quality this time.

My current fanbase is very small, and I was thinking of targeting playlists on Spotify, to reach more people and maybe fans.

For the moment, I’ve only heard about Spotify pitch tool, directly emailing a curator (pretty time consuming?), or using platforms like Submithub or Groover (legit?).

But if I get this straight, I have to know exactly what genre and what potential category of audience my song has. Which is sometimes difficult at the beginning of a career.

What is your experience with these? Did it pay off? Are playlists the best way to reach new fans?

For instance, if you have the time, which kind of genre/playlist type could I reach with my song, and how?

&amp;#x200B;

* **Budget** \- 150-200€
* **Source** \- iPhone XS (with lightning to 3.5 apple adapter) music from spotify 320kbps, sony walkman D-NE300 with cd's (i also got a 2020 ipad pro but i dont have any dongle to connect headphones
* **Requirements for Isolation** I have a pair of airpods pro that i can youse on the way and when i need isolation, so the setup would be mostly for home usage with no needs for isolation
* **Will you be using these Headphones in Public?** nop
* **Preferred Type of Headphone** \- I already have my airpods as in-ear so im searching for a pair of over/ on ear. I have a pair of sharkoon B1 (over-ear headset i use for college lessons on the pc) and i found that my ears sticks a bit too much and they hit the inside of the headphones because there isnt enough depth, so i think that should be considered
* **Preferred tonal balance** \- I just dont know exactly, i like to be able to listen clearly to the bass line and to have crisp drum sounds, but i've never experienced good headphone so i dont know what im searching for
* **Past headphones** \- Airpods pro and the sharkoon B1 are my main headphones now. I have a lot of experience with crappy headphone.
* **Preferred Music** \- I used to listen mostly to rap/pop/indie, but in the last year im re-discovering more genres. I like mostly of toto discography and i listen to A LOT of jazz, mostly smooth jazz (groover jr, john clemmer), so id like to have something not too deviated to a genre
* **What would you like to improve on from your set-up** \- Thats a good question. Im here to ask if the best way-to-go is to invest ""everything"" in a pair of headphones, or if i should buy other things like another source device before (?).(I know what a DAC and a preamp are but im kinda ignorant, so treat me accordingly)

I consider really goodlooking the grado sr60e/80e, but i have no idea if they are good in my situation.

If you live outside of the US, please also provide:

* **Location** \- Italy - Europe

Some of you will already know this and be all like ""we told you so, you idiot"" in which case I am just reinforcing key findings. The findings also apply to my experience. Caveat emptor.

**Here's what I found out**
* Paying for pitching services such as Submithib, Groover and Soundcampaign works and you can increase your monthly streams on Spotify. I increased mine from 0 to about 2k
* The increase in streams does not translate at all well to followers. I gained maybe 20 followers.
* The success rates of different platforms varies wildly. Submithub approval rate was much less than Soundcampaigns.
* There are factors that dictate how many streams a playlist will refer. These are: track position on playlist, time on playlist, number of likes the playlist has. Before you submit to a playlist check how often it is updated. You want ones with *less updates*
* It is not worth submitting to Instagram influencers - the posts are too transient and short lived in my experience
* Submithub's Hot or Not function is incredibly useful in giving you objective feedback, if not a little honest at times.

k18kuv,1606365999.0,musicmarketing,thesillymedico,Marketing for a band that doesn't perform live (strategy doubts),"LONG POST ALERT : So, I'm an an Anesthesiology resident from India who is working most of the time in OT, ICU or covid care ICUs. Besides this I am half of a composer-producer duo who makes music in all genres, mostly clubbing together different genres with some Indian flavours. Me being in one place and my partner being in a completely different place, who is a busy hard working sound engineer, we both don't get much to work on the marketing side of the music.

My current strategy : usually I design the concept and program the song with my laptop and midi controller. Get a rough version done and send it out to my partner. We brainstorm on it, make the track better. And I usually find similar artists from #covers on Instagram and collaborate with them for vocals. Once the track is (half) done(with my rough vocal take), I get the cover art done, I have my friend who helps me get the press release writeup done (he is really good at it). I try to get a music video done usually animated or some stock or sometimes hire dancers to get a somewhat decent music video.

I email my music, PR and unlisted video out to some good music magazines, bloggers, mainly Indian and a few outside ones. Do a short campaign on submithub and groover. Then a week near the release date I send my music to BBC radio for a feature request. When everything goes well, I get  radioplay, listicles/feature on good sites, and once, we were lucky enough to be noticed by Spotify curators and got on Indiestan editorial playlist.

Once the song is out, I usually run an ad campaign on Facebook/insta stories, which is either a hit or a miss. We have been lucky in that till now.

Besides doing all this, we have around 3k monthly listeners on Spotify, the maximum streams we had was 14000 for one song which was a rap on covid in 3 Indian languages which got on a few good playlists.

All these things I do in my spare time and my main goal is to get exposure for the fellow musicians I work with, my partner who is trying to make a name in the Indian sound engineering scene and hopefully some exposure and fans for the artists we feature in our songs. Mostly all the expenses are paid from my pocket, with all the covid situation going on, I don't usually 0 balance at the end of the month.

 We don't do stage shows as it's practically impossible for me and my partner to do something like that. I make my music with a laptop, and akai mpk mini and ATH M50s. That's all the gear I own. I am a classically trained Pianist who haven't got to touch my piano thats in my home since the last 6 years as I never got to visit my hometown since then.

Where am I going wrong? What am I supposed to do that I'm not doing yet? It's all fun and I enjoy music as well as medicine very much and I would never give up one for the other. Should I consider the expenses that occur now as investments and hope that it will pay out eventually? Or should I be doing less and just hope a song goes viral? I love going through YouTube videos on marketing, messaging bloggers and stuff like that, try my own hand on the marketing biz. But the 0 balance at the end of the Month really frustrates me.",3,0.72,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicmarketing/comments/k18kuv/marketing_for_a_band_that_doesnt_perform_live/,Marketing for a band that doesn't perform live (strategy doubts),marketing for a band that doesn't perform live (strategy doubts),"LONG POST ALERT  So, I'm an an Anesthesiology resident from India who is working most of the time in OT, ICU or covid care ICUs.

9x1scv,1542214203.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,OP-1Kanobi,Submitted my track to 81 blogs the day it was released. Here's what happened:,"Rejected. Over and over. The cake is a lie.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bit of background on the track:**

Genre: Electronic with a hint of Indie

Instruments: OP-1, Classical Guitar, Korg Volca Beats, Telecaster, Vocals w harmonies

It was professionally mastered and of a high quality - recorded in a university studio with an SSL desk and ATC monitors (yum i know). 414 on the vox.

&amp;#x200B;

**Submissions:**

Submit Hub:

\- Sent to 28 different blogs who I believed were an appropriate fit in terms of genre

\- Opted for no feedback - just listen for minimum 90 seconds

\- No takers sadly

Email:

\- Emailed 53 blogs directly who again seemed 'right' for this track and logged on a spreadsheet

\- 2 were defunct emails; 1 got back saying they were gonna pass; 1 recommended I sign up for Groover

\- Also no takers

&amp;#x200B;

**Take home:**

\- Ended up releasing the same track on Soundcloud as a preview for the full album

\- Was accepted by all the free sc repost channels I sent it to which got it to approaching 2k plays now

\- Approach blogs a few weeks before your release and offer a premiere

\- Could simply need to approach more blogs

&amp;#x200B;

Sort of at a loss for what to do now in order to promote the album aside from social media marketing. Other options seem to revolve around paid promotion, which I'm too broke for atm so any pearls of wisdom you'd be willing to share would be much appreciated.

**Background** by /u/pomfiture

[""rock 'n' roll aimed to alter consciousness""](http://clrvynt.com/cool-ghouls-interview-count-off/) - September 2016


**Cool Ghouls** formed by **Ryan Wong**, **Pat Thomas**, **Pat McDonald**, and **Alex Fleshman** finished College and settled in San Francisco. Their music centers around what I can only describe as melodic jamming, putting together a riff and running with it. 

*Animal Races* is the band's fourth release, after a debut EP on Under the Gun Records and two albums on Empty Cellar Records. In contrast to their earlier work, this was not recorded live in studio but rather dubbed and overdubbed. That said, Producer **Kelley Stoltz** perfectly captures the sound and, more importantly, the energy of the band and channels it into a rollicking rhythmic trip of catchy licks and riffs, energetic basslines, and masterful drumming.

---- 

**Review** by /u/pomfiture

[""Cosmic American Rock 'n' Roll""](http://www.imposemagazine.com/features/cool-ghouls-prep-for-animal-races) - August 2016

All it takes is a riff, and you're ready to rumble. Throwbacks to **Link Wray and the Wraymen** and **Churchill Downs** boil down to hot tracks on cool wax. Roll a joint. Sit down. Put the needle on the right groove. Light up, and get ready for a journey.

&gt; Q: **What do your parents think about your music?**
&gt; 
&gt; A: *They love that we're in this band - they think it's so fun!*

**Cool Ghouls**' sound defies easy characterization. Press promos say they're not *retro*, but that's about as firm a definition as *indie* in the sense that really anything can be or sound that way. Other ""retro-esque"" bands sound just like the bands on *Nuggets* or *Pebbles*, but **Cool Ghouls** manage to sidestep that by not just rehashing, tearing the sound apart and putting back together, but by also incorporating sounds apart from the psychedelic scene of the late 60s. Yes, there's drone and electric guitar, but there's also pedal steel and MIDI equipment involved.

&gt; Q: **What were your inspirations behind this work?**
&gt; 
&gt; A: Animal Races *came out of a tough year for us. A couple of us went through bad break-ups, [and] SF was continuing to be fucked by its newfound wealth...*

The title track is a tight groover with a message: San Francisco's nouveau riche are killing the city. The words ""Housing Crisis"" barely begin to illustrate the plight of the city's middle class, edged out of their homes by rich eggheads and investors too busy investing in the new passing tech craze to care about the growing homeless and jobless population in San Francisco proper. We sometimes see these villains as the heroes, writer Ryan Wong posits, but in that, we are ""rewarded with the things it takes"" from us. They know the struggle. All of the band members have day jobs, none of which are in the Tech sector. 

&gt; Q: **Who do you play music [for]?**
&gt; 
&gt; A: *The people*.

There's a certain plebeian aspect to the record, and not plebeian in the **/mu/-slash-/r/indieheads** sense, but rather plebeian in the classical sense - this is music for the lower classes, lowbrow music that explains the human condition as experienced by the hobos on Valencia street. ""Brown Bag"" is the hobo anthem for the ages: ""Sittin"" on some grass drinking beer"" while killer riffs - most of the album is centered on these killer riffs - play in the background. Reminiscent of cock rock, for sure, but not without the intelligent rhythm section of **Pat Thomas** and **Alex Fleshman**, who are _expressive_ but not without drowning the melody. One such instance of this would be Time Capsule, which starts with some awe-inducing psych guitar laden with effects, while the rhythm section does its thing in the background. Waves of jangly guitar wash over you as three vocal tracks sing to the future about what's ""happening right now"". The drums here are emotive but still restrained by Kelley Stoltz's amazing production and Mikey Youngâ€™s stellar mixing, letting the guitar parts shine in all their jangly glory.

&gt; **On the topic of living in San Francisco:**
&gt; 
&gt; A: *If we leave, Cool Ghouls is dead.* 

Of course, not everything on the album is meant to be a riff. There is a certain gem in this tracklist that boils over with tweeness - or rather, as twee as psychedelic rock can get. ""Days"" can be considered, after ""Never You Mind"", as one of the standout tracks on the record. Seriously sweet piano melodies float over what sounds like a 12-string rhythm guitar and, of course, a killer electric guitar riff. 

Overall, this album is very refreshing, coming from a band that's not only a spectacularly wild live show, but also stupid good in the studio. The electricity from their live shows has definitely not been diminished by the analog tape this was recorded on, nor has it been diminished by being recorded track by track. This is as much a feat by the band as it is a feat by the producer and mixer, who don't receive nearly enough praise for keeping the band's ethos of rock 'n' roll alive and well.

","hey, it is garage rock day on album of the year 2016 with /u/pomfiture talking about san fran's cool ghouls. get hip!  - - artist cool ghouls ---  listen apple music( bandcamp( spottyfoo( ---  **background** by /u/pomfiture ""rock 'n' roll aimed to alter consciousness""( - september 2016 **cool ghouls** formed by **ryan wong**, **pat thomas**, **pat mcdonald**, and **alex fleshman** finished college and settled in san francisco. their music centers around what i can only describe as melodic jamming, putting together a riff and running with it.  *animal races* is the band's fourth release, after a debut ep on under the gun records and two albums on empty cellar records. in contrast to their earlier work, this was not recorded live in studio but rather dubbed and overdubbed. that said, producer **kelley stoltz** perfectly captures the sound and, more importantly, the energy of the band and channels it into a rollicking rhythmic trip of catchy licks and riffs, energetic basslines, and masterful drumming. ---  **review** by /u/pomfiture ""cosmic american rock 'n' roll""( - august 2016 all it takes is a riff, and you're ready to rumble. throwbacks to **link wray and the wraymen** and **churchill downs** boil down to hot tracks on cool wax. roll a joint. sit down. put the needle on the right groove. light up, and get ready for a journey. > q **what do your parents think about your music?** >  > a *they love that we're in this band - they think it's so fun!* **cool ghouls**' sound defies easy characterization. press promos say they're not *retro*, but that's about as firm a definition as *indie* in the sense that really anything can be or sound that way. other ""retro-esque"" bands sound just like the bands on *nuggets* or *pebbles*, but **cool ghouls** manage to sidestep that by not just rehashing, tearing the sound apart and putting back together, but by also incorporating sounds apart from the psychedelic scene of the late 60s. yes, there's drone and electric guitar, but there's also pedal steel and midi equipment involved. > q **what were your inspirations behind this work?** >  > a animal races *came out of a tough year for us. a couple of us went through bad break-ups, and sf was continuing to be fucked by its newfound wealth...* the title track is a tight groover with a message san francisco's nouveau riche are killing the city. the words ""housing crisis"" barely begin to illustrate the plight of the city's middle class, edged out of their homes by rich eggheads and investors too busy investing in the new passing tech craze to care about the growing homeless and jobless population in san francisco proper. we sometimes see these villains as the heroes, writer ryan wong posits, but in that, we are ""rewarded with the things it takes"" from us. they know the struggle. all of the band members have day jobs, none of which are in the tech sector.  > q **who do you play music for?** >  > a *the people*. there's a certain plebeian aspect to the record, and not plebeian in the **/mu/-slash-/r/indieheads** sense, but rather plebeian in the classical sense - this is music for the lower classes, lowbrow music that explains the human condition as experienced by the hobos on valencia street. ""brown bag"" is the hobo anthem for the ages ""sittin"" on some grass drinking beer"" while killer riffs - most of the album is centered on these killer riffs - play in the background. reminiscent of cock rock, for sure, but not without the intelligent rhythm section of **pat thomas** and **alex fleshman**, who are _expressive_ but not without drowning the melody. one such instance of this would be time capsule, which starts with some awe-inducing psych guitar laden with effects, while the rhythm section does its thing in the background. waves of jangly guitar wash over you as three vocal tracks sing to the future about what's ""happening right now"". the drums here are emotive but still restrained by kelley stoltz's amazing production and mikey youngâ€™s stellar mixing, letting the guitar parts shine in all their jangly glory. > **on the topic of living in san francisco** >  > a *if we leave, cool ghouls is dead.*  of course, not everything on the album is meant to be a riff. there is a certain gem in this tracklist that boils over with tweeness - or rather, as twee as psychedelic rock can get. ""days"" can be considered, after ""never you mind"", as one of the standout tracks on the record. seriously sweet piano melodies float over what sounds like a 12-string rhythm guitar and, of course, a killer electric guitar riff.  overall, this album is very refreshing, coming from a band that's not only a spectacularly wild live show, but also stupid good in the studio. the electricity from their live shows has definitely not been diminished by the analog tape this was recorded on, nor has it been diminished by being recorded track by track. this is as much a feat by the band as it is a feat by the producer and mixer, who don't receive nearly enough praise for keeping the band's ethos of rock 'n' roll alive and well. *** **favorite lyrics** by /u/pomfiture > and you painted the land and the sky > with the colors i see in your eyes > and you taught all the birds to sing your name > so that i know you're never far away * sundial > attn people of the future > i'm talking to you now > it's already happened > it's happening right now * time capsule > tell me did you feel it > feel it when you died > tell me did you realize > when you were gone * when you were gone  ***** **talking points** by /u/pomfiture * what do you think about the current crop of garage rock artists lately? any specific ones hold your interest above the others?
