&amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

so I've been using DistroKid for quite some time now and until recently, I've only had good experiences (except for slow customer service). Unfortunately, a few days ago, I discovered something that disturbs me greatly.

&amp;#x200B;

# Short explanation of DistroKid and the ""Leave A Legacy"" feature

DistroKid is a distribution service that allows independent artists to submit music to platforms like Spotify, Apple Music and many more. You pay them annually (between $19.99 and $79.99 depending on how many artist profiles you want to set up) and are then able to upload as many songs as you want. DistroKid collects your royalties and transfers 100% of them to your account.

When you terminate your subscription, your songs will be taken down from stores because allegedly, keeping them up and collecting the royalties requires work effort and thus has to be paid for.

However, when you upload a song, you have the option to use the so-called ""Leave A Legacy"" feature. For a one-time-payment of $29 for a single or $49 for an album, ""DistroKid will never delete this album from stores due to a lapsed DistroKid membership, **even** ***if you die***."" This is a direct quote from the upload form.

&amp;#x200B;

# ""Leave A Legacy"" only takes effect when you die!?

I happen to be on the newsletter of the ""Indie Music Academy"". The guy behind it, Ryan Waczek, uploaded a video to YouTube about how he ""got banned"" from DistroKid. You can find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYUknhwd1Y8).

Short summary: Ryan uploaded an album. When it wasn't published on the planned date, he contacted support to find out stores rejected his submission and wouldn't accept any future submissions via DistroKid. Ryan decided to pay the ""Leave A Legacy"" fee for all of his uploads so that he could terminate his DistroKid subscription since he would have to switch do a different distributor in the future. He found out that - against common belief - the ""Leave A Legacy"" feature does not apply when you freely choose to end your subscription.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, the theory is: DistroKid's ""Leave A Legacy"" feature does not allow you to end your subscription and still keep your songs up in stores. It only takes effect in case you are **""*****not able*****""** **to continue your subscription, for example in the event of death.**

&amp;#x200B;

I chose to make up my own mind and not fully trust one YouTube video. So I contacted DistroKid's customer service and got a vague, but unsettling response.

&gt;The “Leave a Legacy” extra can be added to a release so that it won't be removed \*due to a lapsed membership payment\* (if you're unable to pay the annual fee in the event of death, etc.). However, adding this extra to a release does not replace your annual membership fee, and it is not a one-time payment for all of your releases.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you intentionally cancel your DistroKid subscription, you wouldn't be able to upload any additional albums, and previous releases will be removed from stores.

([Here's](https://imgur.com/o78vutQ) a screenshot of my ticket. Feel free to contact support yourself if you want confirmation)

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I'm the only one, but this really makes me angry. Wording like ""DistroKid will never delete this album from stores due to a lapsed DistroKid membership, **even** ***if you die.***"" lead me to believe that if I pay the extra fee of $29 / $49, my uploads were safe. Maybe I'm just stupid and naive, but to me it looks more like DistroKid intentionally tries to mislead their customers here. I admit I didn't read the full terms of use and distribution agreement (and I think most people haven't), but a quick cmd + f search shows that in neither of them, the ""Leave A Legacy"" feature is even mentioned.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd really like to know your opinions about this. As I said, I never had extraordinarily bad experiences with DistroKid, but this, to me, is utterly shady.

Also, can't hurt to mention DistroKid founder u/pudjam666. Maybe you can take a stand here?

&amp;#x200B;

Best wishes

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: as u/Bart_s_Noises pointed out, the FAQ state that ""Leave A Legacy"" also takes effect when your credit card runs out.

&gt;In the FAQ, it now says ""even if your credit card stops working and you never renew--even if you die""  
&gt;  
&gt;So if you just cancel your credit card and use a new one it should work...

Might be worth considering.
