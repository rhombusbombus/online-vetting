1agom93,1706829064.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,Past_Bandicoot7199,Anyone looking for a QUALITY music review/feedback platform ? Not playlist marketing. (Assuming you want to grow and monetize ),"I’ve been looking for a quality review source for quite a while . 

So I’ll start by saying I’ve been a music producer for some years now ( 7+) and along the way have worked with many friends who are small to mid sized artists. 

One major, sticking point that I find is that it’s  always a struggle to get quality unbiased opinions of the music . It leads to endless debates and makes it difficult to put your limited resources and efforts toward the right stuff at times. 

The issue with friends and family is that I always feel that the reaction is biased in someway . I’ve tried many services, such as groover, submit hub, etc. Not bad, but I always end up feeling like either bots are the Listeners” Or that main focus of the site are playlist ads and promotion. No focus on reviews and artists development. Many have suggested things such as listening parties, but for an upcoming artist, it can be difficult and expensive getting a good number of people in the same room. 

Long story short , this past year I learned to code and My buddy and I attempted to build a web app where you the artist can connect to multiple listeners of your genre (sort of building a digital listening group ) and you can purchase an in-depth survey review from them. We’re trying to make this QUALITY, so I’d love to hear some feedback. 

For now we’re hiding the Artist identity to get rid of the whole bias and favoritism issue. What do you guys think? I should be  ready to to beta test in the next few days ,  if you’re interested Pm me with your email and artist name. I’ll send it over.

1auqssj,1708358582.0,musicmarketing,saitej_19032000,How to get initial traction (based on comments from this subreddit),"Hello everyone,

One of my posts did very well recently and I got a ton of feedback on 'how to get initial traction on songs.'

This post will summarise all the advice I got.

Original Post: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/musicmarketing/s/QDpQUwh53V


Tips to get initial traction.

1. Collaborate with other artists - This was the most common advice of all. Doesn't cost much and is fun too. Only problem, there aren't much platforms that allow us to do this automatically, so you actually have to reach out to people.

2. SubmitHub - spend some bucks and you get a good deal, problem is that it is hard to predict how much you can make out of your investment.

3. Spotify and Meta Ads - ear what you can chew type

4. Live shows, open mics - personally, toughest one but well worth it 

5. Instagram Reels/Tiktok - they help you get the attention of labels and make your life easier. A chance to go viral. Hardest part is being consistent. (? Maybe an app that has templates to simply record and it automatically posts it for me..idk)

6. Repostexchange - this one is pretty old. Takes time to get results. Good for getting feedback.

Thankyou all for responding. If you all have any more ideas, feel free to share them below. I'll add them as they come 

Fun Discussion - submithub and repostexchange are great platforms, but not the best for us, if you want an app, what features would you need it to have?

1atbd23,1708201450.0,musicmarketing,jimmyslaysdragons,"Blessed by the Release Radar algorithm on our previous single, but not on our current one. Any insight?","Hi all, my indie rock band is currently releasing our new EP as singles with the waterfall method every 6 weeks. 

This is our second EP. Prior to releasing the first single from this new EP, we were averaging only 25-30 monthly listeners on our original EP and we had \~60 followers.

For whatever reason, our second single got picked up by Spotify's Release Radar and was streamed by an extra \~1,500 listeners above our normal amount. However, this did not happen for our first our third single, even though we do the same thing for each single: Pitch to Spotify editorial 1 month in advance of release and then pitch to \~15 playlists on SubmitHub on release day.

* Single #1: Released and submitted to playlists on SubmitHub. Got on 4 playlists. \~400 streams in the first week. \~20 streams from Release Radar.
* Single #2: Released and submitted to playlists on SubmitHub. Got on 5 playlists. \~500 streams in the first week. \~20 streams from Release Radar in the first week. **BUT** in the **second week**, it suddenly got another **1,500 streams** from Release Radar. We gained 25 new followers and peaked at around 2,200 monthly listeners.
* Single #3: Released last week and submitted to playlists on SubmitHub. Got on 4 playlists. \~300 streams in the first week. \~40 streams from Release Radar. **Did not get added to more Release Radar playlists in week 2.**

After Single #2's unexpected success, I was hoping that Single #3 would get the same Release Radar bump, but it didn't happen.

Anyone have insight into what happened here? We have 2 more singles in the pipeline and I'd love to increase their chances of getting that Release Radar bump again. Thanks!

1akm9xz,1707257447.0,musicmarketing,NoName22415,General Question - Where should I spend money on promotion?,"Hello,  
New to this community, I did read through the commonly asked questions and still just wanted to get a feel for others' experiences out there. I have a band, fairly newly formed, but has kind of built a small amount of momentum.   
We do all the self promotion stuff, have used submithub and submitlink, gone through the tedious processes of finding playlist curators and reaching out directly, all that stuff, basically if it can be done for free, we have and continue to do it.  
Personally, I do not like submithub or submitlink, and it has a lot to do with our music. We do reggae rock, and often the feedback is overwhelmingly positive, but we are either too heavy or not heavy enough to be appropriate for playlists, though we have gotten onto a few pretty good ones - its just not nearly the success rate that would make me want to continue to throw funds at these sites.   


The majority of our plays now come from spotify radio, which is nice, but we really want to see what we can do to push it to another level.   


We have a song releasing March 1st, and I am contemplating using Spotify Marquee, but there is so much conflicting information online. I have also heard good things about groover and haven't tried it, same with Playlist push.   


What have your experiences been? Have any of these services shown actual positive results for you? Did you go a different route and possibly hire a marketing team, and if so, how did that go? I am willing to look into any and all possibilities, but there can be absolutely NO BOTS in any method we use.

We do all the self promotion stuff, have used submithub and submitlink, gone through the tedious processes of finding playlist curators and reaching out directly, all that stuff, basically if it can be done for free, we have and continue to do it.   Personally, I do not like submithub or submitlink, and it has a lot to do with our music. We do reggae rock, and often the feedback is overwhelmingly positive, but we are either too heavy or not heavy enough to be appropriate for playlists, though we have gotten onto a few pretty good ones - its just not nearly the success rate that would make me want to continue to throw funds at these sites.    The majority of our plays now come from spotify radio, which is nice, but we really want to see what we can do to push it to another level.    We have a song releasing March 1st, and I am contemplating using Spotify Marquee, but there is so much conflicting information online. I have also heard good things about groover and haven't tried it, same with Playlist push.    What have your experiences been? Have any of these services shown actual positive results for you? Did you go a different route and possibly hire a marketing team, and if so, how did that go? I am willing to look into any and all possibilities, but there can be absolutely NO BOTS in any method we use.

**Tips for Submit Hub:**

* I really went through most of their playlists and made sure to strongly categorize my song, the song I used was SomeWhere, I produced, recorded the vocals, mixed, and mastered it. I also made sure to pop out an instrumental version so I could shoot 2 shots at one time. 
* I chose emo rap and sad songs because that is the energy and vibe that it has.
* Be very particular about the playlist, as most of you know, they will be picky about your song
* Songs under 3 minutes do best 
* If you use a lot of autotune, check to make sure they like that, I know that sounds weird to hone in on, but I have had really good songs with great feedback from playlisters get denied because they don't like autotune, I find its either playlisters like autotune or completely hate it haha
* Cover Art Matters, from the image it is plain as day to see what I put together for the artwork to invoke a certain response, the visual hook is there to at least make a person ask what could this song be
* Arrangement: Intro (usually foreshadows what the chorus will be), Verse, Chorus, Verse, Outro - This is the arrangement I usually follow. I am not telling you to copy, I just find this creates a solid storyline that most people can understand. I do see music as a rollercoaster ride with chapters. 
* When submitting I write one pitch for everyone that usually states, ""HI there, I really like your playlists and felt this sad emo song would be a good fit for it, thanks for listening"" If you can't clearly define what category your song fits into, your going to have a hard time get approvals.
* Create your own lists of playlisters that have accepted you or at least give feedback that makes sense. I say this because if a playlisters gives me a bullshxt response that makes no sense, I make sure to cross them off my list to never submit to again.

I'm low budget but maybe try SubmitHub to for the first time see if others will subscribe to my YouTube channel and maybe try to sell my first song, Indie Folk, me singing and playing solo acoustic guitar... on a place like Spotify.  Also, can I sell my song on CD Baby at the same time, or is that taboo? 

SubmitHub help said they no longer submit to record companies, so does this mean playlists and blogs are the primary option SubmitHub offers for promoting my song? 

How far does $100 go? 

Does SubmitHub try to place me or do I have to do that job via SubmitHub ""SH"" to get anywhere? 

I don't know anything about self-promotion which is why I want to try SH. So before I promote myself through SH I better have my song already posted for sale at Spotify, right? 

Also I've asked SH help several times what box, should I check in their submission process, ""Released (public)"" or ""Unreleased (private)""?  

They also haven't answered if the premium membership is very beneficial to someone like me who is an unknown musician/songwriter? What have your experiences been with SH? 

Is being an Indie Folk singer and my first song to promote, a sad unrequited love song, an unpopular genre? Any feedback is greatly appreciated!

My question, apart from submithub and groover and musosoup, and ofcourse apart from editorial playlists, is there any realistic way of getting onto a big playlist? Even when i get approval from submithub etc., and I do filter by engagement, the numbers are so low i need some proper push.

1afog6a,1706724908.0,musicians,mhkaz,"Here is my guide to Spotify, other DSPs &amp; releases in general.","Saw a dude trying to make ppl jump through hoops on his website earlier to get some basic info on the pretense of it being ""free"" so they can later spam you with their courses. I don't like that. That annoys me. 

So I have decided to re-post a guide I made in r/musicmarketing earlier this week. Hopefully, this gives you some straight info without sacrificing your inbox.   
\_\_\_\_  


&amp;#x200B;

I've been finding myself commenting the same couple of things under each ""help"" me post so I decided to give this sub a condensed version of what tell my artists &amp; clients.  This is a basic roadmap covering critical aspects of a music release – from the initial stages of preparing and strategizing your release to post-release promotion.

Please remember that without a REAL connection with your fan base, you will not achieve anything, this means treating them as humans not just dumping your songs onto them. Make it enjoyable to watch your videos, images, etc. BE AUTHENTIC IN YOUR CONTENT. I can’t stress this enough, the same way you can spot disingenuous content, they can also. Stop with the bullshit tacky “coming out soon” videos, listen now posts, etc. Make exciting content that showcases your AUTHENTIC self.

I don't want to hear your complaints about Spotify &amp; social media being the devil. Tbh, not sure why you'd be in a music marketing subreddit to begin with if that's the case. If you want to be a studio musician or work in sync, that's cool, I support it and it's an extremely lucrative career path but this isn't going to be for you.

For those trying to gain an audience, I hope this serves you well.

Cheers

**Pre-Release Preparation- 3 Months Before Release**

Creating an effective Pre-Release Content Strategy involves a balance. It's about generating excitement and anticipation for your release without falling into the trap of making your content feel like just another shitty artist trying to peddle their music. *Everyone* is constantly bombarded with ads, the challenge lies in crafting content that stands out by being authentic and engaging, rather than just another look at me, play my music, me me me post.

The key is to focus on storytelling and genuine engagement. Share the story behind your music, not just the end product. This could include a behind-the-scenes breakdown into your creative process, the ups and downs of making music, and personal hobbies that give your audience a window into your world as an artist. By doing so, you're not only building anticipation for your release but also forging a deeper connection with your audience. Be yourself, why would you want people to like a fake version of you? You will hate yourself for having to uphold an image that isn’t you.

Incorporate elements like teaser videos or studio session snippets, but ensure they are more than just basic previews. They should invite your audience into your world, offering a taste of your upcoming work while also providing value in themselves. This could be through the emotion they evoke, the story they tell, or the unique perspective they offer.

It's crucial to interact with your audience rather than just broadcast to them. Engage them in conversations, ask for their opinions, and make them feel like a part of your musical journey because guess what? They are! Your goal is to transform your audience from passive listeners to active participants. These will be the ones that buy tickets, merch, engage on posts, and anticipate future releases.

Your Pre-Release Content Strategy should not only aim to inform your audience about your upcoming release but also to connect with them on a human level. Make your content so engaging and authentic that it stands out amidst the crap you probably complain about getting more attention, don’t make advertisements, create a meaningful and intriguing glimpse into who you are.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Strategic Contact Research | Early Relationship Building - +3 Months Before Release**

Building a list of contacts with websites, blogs, and writers' emails is a task that goes beyond “networking”. It's about cultivating genuine relationships (yes, this will be an ongoing theme) with those who can help amplify your music's reach. The goal is not just to gain coverage but to connect with individuals who genuinely resonate with your music and your story.

Start by researching and identifying websites, blogs, and writers that align with your genre and style. This isn't just about finding any music platform but focusing on those where your music naturally fits. Use Google or Rocketreach, but also explore the social media profiles and personal websites of these writers and bloggers. Pay attention to their work, understanding the type of content they produce and the music they typically feature. Do not stalk or be weird. Keep it professional.

When reaching out, personalize your message. Reference specific articles or reviews they've written that resonated with you, don’t make shit up. This shows that you're not just sending a mass message but that you give a damn &amp; have taken the time to understand their work and interests. Don’t forget these are humans with their own goals and objectives with their writing. You don’t just collaborate with anyone and that is exactly what you are asking of them if you think about it.

Introduce yourself and your music, but also express interest in their perspectives and insights. This should be done even before you have a release planned. The idea is to start a conversation, not just pitch your music like everyone else. By doing so, you’re laying the groundwork for a relationship based on mutual respect and interest. DO NOT FAKE RELATIONSHIPS, find people you genuinely fuck with, there are tons of writers out there find yours.

It’s crucial to ensure that these contacts care about your genre or style. A targeted outreach means that your music finds the right ears, making the conversations more productive and meaningful.

Once you establish contact, maintain the relationship. Comment on their articles, share their work, or engage in discussions about music. This isn't about relentless self-promotion; it’s about being part of a community. You have to show support, it can’t always be a one-way street. When the time comes to send your press release or share your music, it won’t just be another email in their inbox; it’ll be a message from a familiar and respected member of their musical circle.

Remember, building contacts is a long-term investment. It’s about creating a network of supporters and advocates for you, your project &amp; your music, not just a one-off promotional exchange. This approach not only shows consistency but increases the chances of your music being featured and appreciated while enriching your understanding of the music industry and its key players.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Profile Optimization - 3 Months Before Release**

Remember, the objective of ANY PLATFORM is to keep listeners engaged with your content. This means not just attracting them to your profile but keeping them there with updated, and interactive content. Why would Spotify give a half-assed profile the spotlight? Why would they playlist someone who doesn't give a shit?

With Spotify's focus on providing an experience, fully fleshed-out profiles that utilize *all available features* and showcase your music's uniqueness are more likely to be highlighted and recommended within the platform.

Optimizing your Spotify profile involves several key elements that ensure your presence on the platform is as compelling and engaging as possible. Spotify wants to showcase artist using their platform to its fullest potential.

It's essential to keep your profile and cover photos updated regularly, especially with each new release. This visual aspect is crucial as it's often the first impression potential listeners have of your music. Your bio is another vital component. It should be more than just a list of achievements or a dry account of your musical history, no one gives a shit. Instead, it should tell your story, connecting with listeners and giving them insight into who you are as an artist and what your music represents.

Adding a “Canvas” to every release is crucial, A well-chosen Canvas can complement your song's mood, add to its storytelling, and increase engagement, as visually captivating tracks tend to get more shares and saves. A creative and eye-catching Canvas that isn’t cookie-cutter could be just the thing that makes someone stop scrolling and start listening.  Doing the Amazon ""canvas"" equivalent which is [voice intros](https://artists.amazonmusic.com/new-release-intro).

The integration of lyrics through [Musixmatch](https://pro.musixmatch.com/) is an often-overlooked feature. By syncing your lyrics, you enhance the listener's experience, allowing them to connect more deeply with your songs &amp; share snippets on socials.

Use Spotify's 'Clips' feature. This tool allows you to add short video clips to your tracks, providing a visual element that can enhance listener engagement and showcase your music's personality.

Linking merchandise to your profile is also an important aspect of optimization. It not only offers fans a way to support you but also adds another layer of professionalism to your profile.

Display your tour/show dates with [Songkick Tourbox](https://tourbox.songkick.com/).

All of these things will make your profile a “model Spotify Artist” &amp; one they won't hesitate to promote/highlight/showcase.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Press Release - 2 Months Before Release\***

^(\[We are assuming that you have your final Master &amp; have distributed it at this point; this needs to be done WELL in advance, not a few weeks before so you have access to pitching\])

When crafting a press release for your single or album, it’s important to capture your project in a way that engages and informs. You don’t want to be using crazy words, be GENUINE (literally the key to everything) Start with an introductory paragraph that hooks the reader – this could be a brief story about the inspiration behind the album, a notable collaboration, or an interesting aspect of the production.

In the body of the press release, provide more detail. This should include background on the making of the album or single, discussion on the lyrics, and any unique features or highlights. If there’s a particular narrative or theme that ties the project together, elaborate on this to give writers and bloggers a deeper understanding of your work. Include quotes from yourself or collaborators that provide personal insights into the music.

Finish with details such as track listings, availability (platforms where the music will be released), and contact information for further inquiries.

Don’t forget to add links to your music, social media profiles, and any relevant multimedia assets like album art or promotional photos.

The length of a press release generally should be about one page, roughly 500-750 words, to ensure it's short yet informative enough to engage the reader.

&amp;#x200B;

*Press Release Example:*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**“SMALL IMAGE OF ALBUM ARTWORK”**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Unnamed Artist - “Echoes of Heartbreak”**  
&gt;  
&gt;\[short link to stream/DL\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Release Date: \[Date Placeholder\]  
&gt;  
&gt;**\[City, State\]** – In an expressive release of emotion, \[Artist Name\] presents their latest single ""Song Title"", a narrative on heartbreak and the personal journey towards recovery. This track, born out of an intense five-hour session with collaborator \[Collaborator Name\], is not only deeply personal but also resonates with a large audience.  
&gt;  
&gt;Facing one of their most challenging breakups, \[Artist Name\] turned to songwriting for comfort, “I felt completely isolated, and this song became a medium for the emotions I was grappling with.” ""Song Title"" confronts the dichotomy between societal expectations to recover swiftly from a breakup and the reality of enduring heartache.  
&gt;  
&gt;The single addresses the often silent pressure to heal quickly from heartbreak, contrasting it with the more extended process of true emotional recovery. \[Artist Name\] explains, “This song is about the uncomfortable rush society imposes on us to heal.” It extends empathy to those still feeling sad long after a relationship has ended, serving as a reminder that healing is a personal journey.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Song Title” is not just a single; it is a message that healing takes time and should not be rushed. Through this song, \[Artist Name\] connects with those on the arduous path of emotional healing, affirming, “Your feelings are valid and understood.”

&amp;#x200B;

**Distributing Press Release - 1.5 Months Before Release**

Distribution of your press release is where your contact building comes into play. Utilize the relationships you’ve developed with bloggers, journalists, and writers. Since you’ve taken the time to understand their interests and build rapport, tailor your email or message when sending the press release. Highlight aspects of your release that align with their previous work or interests.

Remember that the most impactful connections are those you’ve personally nurtured. These are the individuals who are more likely to give your release the attention it deserves. When you send out the press release, personalize your emails. A personal touch shows that you’re not just sending out a mass email but that you value the recipient's role in the music industry.

The goal of the press release is not just to inform, but to tell your story. It’s about presenting your music in a way that resonates with your audience and provides them with everything they need to write a compelling piece about your work.

Timing is also critical. Plan to send out your press release 1.5 months in advance of your release date, giving writers and bloggers enough time to cover your music.

After sending your press release, it's crucial to follow up effectively without being annoying. Begin by giving recipients a week and a half to review your press release. Then, send a follow-up email, reiterating the key points and offering additional information or answers to questions. The key is to be persistent but not pushy, so if there's no response after one or two follow-ups, it's best to move on.

Don’t be that person who comments “Check your DM’s/email” on their socials.

&amp;#x200B;

**Spotify/DSP Pitch** **- 1 Month Before Release**

When making your Spotify pitch, consider it as an alternative version to your press release, but tailored specifically for Spotify’s curators. The pitch should convey the unique elements of your music, extracting key parts of your press release such as the story behind the song, its distinctive features, and any inspirations. This ensures consistency in your messaging and leverages the time/effort you’ve already put into crafting your press release.

The inclusion of a marketing plan in your pitch is crucial. This plan should detail how you intend to drive engagement and listeners to Spotify. Highlight any promotional activities, social media campaigns, or content strategies that will draw traffic to your track on the platform. The aim is to show Spotify that you are not only invested in promoting your music but also in contributing to keeping users engaged on their platform. This is why optimizing your profile is so important.

The most important aspects of pitching are focusing on clarity and relevance. Ensure your pitch is concise, directly addressing why your track would be a good fit for the playlist you’re targeting. It’s important to be genre-specific and align your music with the curator's tastes and the playlist’s theme. You have a limited amount of words to do this, so be smart.

What to avoid in a pitch is equally important. Do not use generic statements and exaggerations that don't provide specific information about your music. Avoid making unrealistic claims or comparisons that may set expectations too high. The goal is to be authentic and honest, presenting your music in a way that speaks for itself.

In summary, a successful Spotify pitch is a blend of insightful information from your press release, a clear and concise explanation of what makes your track unique, and a solid plan for driving engagement on the platform. It’s about showing Spotify not just the quality of your music, but also your proactive approach to attracting and retaining listeners on their platform.

When pitching to Spotify's Editorial Playlist, keep your submission concise, limiting it to 500 characters. Ideally, submit your pitch at least 2 weeks before your release date. This timing increases the likelihood of your track also being included in algorithmic playlists like Release Radar &amp; Radio.

When composing your pitch, remember to include the following elements:

* Always use third-person narration.
* Mention the artist's name, their location, and the genres they represent.
* Provide details about the track, including insights into the production process, lyrics, sounds, and the emotions it conveys.
* Describe your promotion strategy

&amp;#x200B;

*Example 1:*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""'Ava Grayson', a Denver singer-songwriter, and 'Nova Pulse', a Parisian producer, present 'Whispering Pines', a folk-electronica fusion. Ava's vocals and Nova's Moby-like electronic arrangements have intrigued 'Harmony Records', with promotion planned on NPR's All Songs Considered and across US and French music blogs and radio.""

&amp;#x200B;

*Example 2:*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""'KRONIK', Miami's bass scene star, collaborates with Tokyo's 'Lunar Echoes' on 'Neon Dreams', a vibrant colorbass track blending pulsating beats and Madeon-style electronics. Garnering 'ElectroGroove Records' interest, it's slated for SiriusXM's BPM and various EDM festivals and blogs in the US and Japan.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Amazon Pitch - 1 Month Before Release**

While many artists focus primarily on Spotify, it's crucial not to forget about Amazon Music. This platform gets less attention from artists, giving you a potential advantage due to the less crowded space. By using your Spotify strategies on Amazon Music, you can tap into a unique audience segment. Ensure your Amazon Music profile is meticulously updated and fully utilized.

This includes leveraging distinctive features like voice intros, which allow you to add a personal touch to your music, and Twitch integrations, catering to the crossover audience between music listeners and gaming communities.

Additionally, Amazon Music's less saturated environment compared to Spotify's crowded playlisting space can work in your favor. With fewer artists pitching, your music has a higher chance of standing out and being featured. This approach is not just about diversification; it’s a strategic move to increase visibility where your competition might be lower.

Each platform has its audience and quirks, and by not limiting yourself to just one, you increase your chances of reaching a wider, more varied listener base. In the end, while Spotify is undeniably a major player in the music streaming world, leveraging other platforms like Amazon Music can provide you with an edge in a highly competitive market.

*^(\*\*Keep in mind that Amazon pitches have a 1000-character limit use it to your advantage to add more details.)*

&amp;#x200B;

**Third-Party Playlist Pitching -** **1 Month Before Release**

Investigate and submit your music to relevant Spotify playlists. To find curators, check the playlist's description on Spotify for contact info, or use Google to search for the curator's details. You will be using the same strategy used for obtaining writers/bloggers' contact information.

When pitching to a Spotify User Playlist, the approach can vary widely, ranging from an email to an Instagram DM, or even more unconventional methods (Submithub, Weird websites, etc.), depending on the curator's preferred submission process. Discover their guidelines by examining their user profile or the playlist's description.

To truly stand out to a user curator, it's crucial to grasp what they're looking for. Do they, have a deep interest in your genre, or are they more financially driven?

Regardless, simplicity is key. Avoid getting bogged down in excessive details.

Key Points for Your Pitch:

* Emphasize simplicity, which is always appreciated.
* Maintain a kind and friendly tone.
* Clearly state your artist name, location, and genre(s).
* Briefly describe your track, including production highlights, its distinctive sounds, and the emotions it evokes.
* Outline your promotion strategy. If advantageous, include your follower count and monthly listeners; if not, it's better to omit these details.

*Example:*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Hey \[Playlist Curator's Name\]!  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm a huge fan of your playlist \[Playlist Name\]. I wanted to reach out to inquire about your submission process. I've recently worked on a new track that I believe would be a fantastic fit for “playlist name”.  
&gt;  
&gt;The track, titled ""\[Insert Song Title\],"" is a bass-heavy track set to release on \[Insert Release Date\]. This song holds a special place as it represents \[briefly describe the story or inspiration behind the song\]. \[Decribe track further production/sound-wise\], something I feel would resonate well with the vibe of your playlist.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm currently promoting this track across various platforms, including \[insert marketing strategy here\]. I believe it would add a unique flavor to your collection.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'd be thrilled if you could spare a moment to listen to it.  
&gt;  
&gt;Here's the link: \[Insert Link Here\].  
&gt;  
&gt;Looking forward to your thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Choosing the Right Playlisting Services** **- 1 Month Before Release**

***If your budget is over $500***, When considering playlisting services, prioritize those that are curated by individuals who value genuine selection overpaid, automatic placements. Opt for services that distribute your track to playlist curators, allowing them to choose whether to include your music based on its merit. It's important to remember that this process is discretionary, much like Spotify's, where curators have the final say in adding or not adding your track to their playlists. This approach ensures a more authentic and potentially rewarding placement for your music. Playlisting is a strategy that broadens your reach, but *its true value is realized only when complemented with consistent, quality music releases and targeted advertising for future projects*. It's about not just capturing an audience, but also maintaining their interest and loyalty over time. I highly recommend not doing playlisting if you do not have additional funds to engage the audience afterward.

***With a budget under $500***, the focus should be on leveraging organic growth and cost-effective strategies. Creating engaging content is key – music videos, behind-the-scenes footage, and interactive social media posts designed to resonate with your audience and encourage shares. This approach helps increase visibility without a heavy reliance on advertising funds. Simultaneously, targeted social media ads can be highly effective. Even small investments in platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok, *when carefully tailored to your target audience* or *placed behind content already performing well organically* can yield significant results. Tapping into existing networks, and collaborating with other artists or fans are cost-efficient ways to expand your reach. Continuously analyze and adapt your strategies based on audience engagement patterns, ensuring that every dollar of your budget is effectively utilized to grow your listener base.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Post-Release Promotion** **- Ongoing After Release Until Next Release Cycle**

Post-release, your focus should shift towards content creation and social media engagement to keep the conversation around your track vibrant. Share updates, user-generated content, reviews, and mentions of your music. Engage your audience with varied content like live performance videos, behind-the-scenes glimpses of the creation process, and discussions about the track's meaning.

Remember, the long-term goal is to get picked up by Spotify's algorithm, leading to features in radio stations, discovery playlists, and more. This kind of organic growth can be more valuable than editorial playlisting in the long run, as it signifies a genuine and growing interest in your music.

Simultaneously, targeted social media ad campaigns can broaden your reach, drawing in new listeners. Showcasing playlist additions, positive reviews, and fan testimonials can add credibility and pique curiosity, attracting a wider audience.

Amid these promotional activities, expressing gratitude plays a crucial role. Thank your fans through various channels, as they are fundamental to your music's success. Consider personal engagement strategies, like live Q&amp;A sessions, thank-you emails, or special content dedicated to fans. This appreciation helps fortify their loyalty and encourages ongoing support.

Equally important is acknowledging the playlists, writers, and bloggers who supported your release. Public shoutouts, personalized messages, or mentions in interviews not only show your appreciation but also strengthen your relationships within the music industry. This can pave the way for continued support and coverage for your future releases.

In essence, post-release promotion is a balanced mix of maintaining visibility for your track and nurturing the relationships you've built with your audience and industry professionals. By combining ongoing engagement with a heartfelt expression of gratitude, you set a foundation for sustained growth and support in your musical journey.

I will not be providing resources to third-party playlisting services since most offered online are not legitimate &amp; their performances vary with each genre &amp; campaign. Quality tends to decline pretty quickly since platforms start seeing $$ over integrity. For an up-to-date list of recommended playlist services or individuals feel free to reach out.  I'm happy to provide these, I just don't want this post to stay here praising them and not be updated if their quality drops.

What I will provide is a link to a tool that will help assist you in seeing bot activity on playlists to verify the legitimacy this can be found here: [https://www.artist.tools](https://www.artist.tools/)

I *highly recommend* auditing any playlist/curator you plan on working with before your campaign.

If you are still facing problems with obtaining streams then it might be time to go back to the studio and clean things up or check on your content. This may seem harsh, but the truth is that Spotify is giving you access to millions of people who otherwise you would need to hit the streets to acquire. Just because you don’t have to pass out mixtapes in 2024, doesn’t mean that you don’t have to put in the work. The platforms DSPs offer give you a chance to reach a global audience. This guide won't guarantee you being playlisted but it will greatly improve your chances.

Thank you for making it this far. 

If you still need help, I don’t mean “I want someone to do everything for me” help, feel free to reach out.",1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1afog6a/here_is_my_guide_to_spotify_other_dsps_releases/,"Here is my guide to Spotify, other DSPs & releases in general.","here is my guide to spotify, other dsps & releases in general.","Saw a dude trying to make ppl jump through hoops on his website earlier to get some basic info on the pretense of it being ""free"" so they can later spam you with their courses. I don't like that. That annoys me.  So I have decided to re-post a guide I made in r/musicmarketing earlier this week. Hopefully, this gives you some straight info without sacrificing your inbox.    \_\_\_\_   &x200B; I've been finding myself commenting the same couple of things under each ""help"" me post so I decided to give this sub a condensed version of what tell my artists & clients.  This is a basic roadmap covering critical aspects of a music release – from the initial stages of preparing and strategizing your release to post-release promotion. Please remember that without a REAL connection with your fan base, you will not achieve anything, this means treating them as humans not just dumping your songs onto them. Make it enjoyable to watch your videos, images, etc. BE AUTHENTIC IN YOUR CONTENT. I can’t stress this enough, the same way you can spot disingenuous content, they can also. Stop with the bullshit tacky “coming out soon” videos, listen now posts, etc. Make exciting content that showcases your AUTHENTIC self. I don't want to hear your complaints about Spotify & social media being the devil. Tbh, not sure why you'd be in a music marketing subreddit to begin with if that's the case. If you want to be a studio musician or work in sync, that's cool, I support it and it's an extremely lucrative career path but this isn't going to be for you. For those trying to gain an audience, I hope this serves you well. Cheers &x200B; &x200B; **Pre-Release Preparation- 3 Months Before Release** Creating an effective Pre-Release Content Strategy involves a balance. It's about generating excitement and anticipation for your release without falling into the trap of making your content feel like just another shitty artist trying to peddle their music. *Everyone* is constantly bombarded with ads, the challenge lies in crafting content that stands out by being authentic and engaging, rather than just another look at me, play my music, me me me post. The key is to focus on storytelling and genuine engagement. Share the story behind your music, not just the end product. This could include a behind-the-scenes breakdown into your creative process, the ups and downs of making music, and personal hobbies that give your audience a window into your world as an artist. By doing so, you're not only building anticipation for your release but also forging a deeper connection with your audience. Be yourself, why would you want people to like a fake version of you? You will hate yourself for having to uphold an image that isn’t you. Incorporate elements like teaser videos or studio session snippets, but ensure they are more than just basic previews. They should invite your audience into your world, offering a taste of your upcoming work while also providing value in themselves. This could be through the emotion they evoke, the story they tell, or the unique perspective they offer. It's crucial to interact with your audience rather than just broadcast to them. Engage them in conversations, ask for their opinions, and make them feel like a part of your musical journey because guess what? They are! Your goal is to transform your audience from passive listeners to active participants. These will be the ones that buy tickets, merch, engage on posts, and anticipate future releases. Your Pre-Release Content Strategy should not only aim to inform your audience about your upcoming release but also to connect with them on a human level. Make your content so engaging and authentic that it stands out amidst the crap you probably complain about getting more attention, don’t make advertisements, create a meaningful and intriguing glimpse into who you are. &x200B; &x200B; **Strategic Contact Research | Early Relationship Building - 3 Months Before Release** Building a list of contacts with websites, blogs, and writers' emails is a task that goes beyond “networking”. It's about cultivating genuine relationships (yes, this will be an ongoing theme) with those who can help amplify your music's reach. The goal is not just to gain coverage but to connect with individuals who genuinely resonate with your music and your story. Start by researching and identifying websites, blogs, and writers that align with your genre and style. This isn't just about finding any music platform but focusing on those where your music naturally fits. Use Google or Rocketreach, but also explore the social media profiles and personal websites of these writers and bloggers. Pay attention to their work, understanding the type of content they produce and the music they typically feature. Do not stalk or be weird. Keep it professional. When reaching out, personalize your message. Reference specific articles or reviews they've written that resonated with you, don’t make shit up. This shows that you're not just sending a mass message but that you give a damn & have taken the time to understand their work and interests. Don’t forget these are humans with their own goals and objectives with their writing. You don’t just collaborate with anyone and that is exactly what you are asking of them if you think about it. Introduce yourself and your music, but also express interest in their perspectives and insights. This should be done even before you have a release planned. The idea is to start a conversation, not just pitch your music like everyone else. By doing so, you’re laying the groundwork for a relationship based on mutual respect and interest. DO NOT FAKE RELATIONSHIPS, find people you genuinely fuck with, there are tons of writers out there find yours. It’s crucial to ensure that these contacts care about your genre or style. A targeted outreach means that your music finds the right ears, making the conversations more productive and meaningful. Once you establish contact, maintain the relationship. Comment on their articles, share their work, or engage in discussions about music. This isn't about relentless self-promotion; it’s about being part of a community. You have to show support, it can’t always be a one-way street. When the time comes to send your press release or share your music, it won’t just be another email in their inbox; it’ll be a message from a familiar and respected member of their musical circle. Remember, building contacts is a long-term investment. It’s about creating a network of supporters and advocates for you, your project & your music, not just a one-off promotional exchange. This approach not only shows consistency but increases the chances of your music being featured and appreciated while enriching your understanding of the music industry and its key players. &x200B; &x200B; **Profile Optimization - 3 Months Before Release** Remember, the objective of ANY PLATFORM is to keep listeners engaged with your content. This means not just attracting them to your profile but keeping them there with updated, and interactive content. Why would Spotify give a half-assed profile the spotlight? Why would they playlist someone who doesn't give a shit? With Spotify's focus on providing an experience, fully fleshed-out profiles that utilize *all available features* and showcase your music's uniqueness are more likely to be highlighted and recommended within the platform. Optimizing your Spotify profile involves several key elements that ensure your presence on the platform is as compelling and engaging as possible. Spotify wants to showcase artist using their platform to its fullest potential. It's essential to keep your profile and cover photos updated regularly, especially with each new release. This visual aspect is crucial as it's often the first impression potential listeners have of your music. Your bio is another vital component. It should be more than just a list of achievements or a dry account of your musical history, no one gives a shit. Instead, it should tell your story, connecting with listeners and giving them insight into who you are as an artist and what your music represents. Adding a “Canvas” to every release is crucial, A well-chosen Canvas can complement your song's mood, add to its storytelling, and increase engagement, as visually captivating tracks tend to get more shares and saves. A creative and eye-catching Canvas that isn’t cookie-cutter could be just the thing that makes someone stop scrolling and start listening.  Doing the Amazon ""canvas"" equivalent which is voice intros When crafting a press release for your single or album, it’s important to capture your project in a way that engages and informs. You don’t want to be using crazy words, be GENUINE (literally the key to everything) Start with an introductory paragraph that hooks the reader – this could be a brief story about the inspiration behind the album, a notable collaboration, or an interesting aspect of the production. In the body of the press release, provide more detail. This should include background on the making of the album or single, discussion on the lyrics, and any unique features or highlights. If there’s a particular narrative or theme that ties the project together, elaborate on this to give writers and bloggers a deeper understanding of your work. Include quotes from yourself or collaborators that provide personal insights into the music. Finish with details such as track listings, availability (platforms where the music will be released), and contact information for further inquiries. Don’t forget to add links to your music, social media profiles, and any relevant multimedia assets like album art or promotional photos. The length of a press release generally should be about one page, roughly 500-750 words, to ensure it's short yet informative enough to engage the reader. &x200B; *Press Release Example* &x200B; >**“SMALL IMAGE OF ALBUM ARTWORK”**   >   >**Unnamed Artist - “Echoes of Heartbreak”**   >   >\short link to stream/DL\   >   >Release Date \Date Placeholder\   >   >**\City, State\** – In an expressive release of emotion, \Artist Name\ presents their latest single ""Song Title"", a narrative on heartbreak and the personal journey towards recovery. This track, born out of an intense five-hour session with collaborator \Collaborator Name\, is not only deeply personal but also resonates with a large audience.   >   >Facing one of their most challenging breakups, \Artist Name\ turned to songwriting for comfort, “I felt completely isolated, and this song became a medium for the emotions I was grappling with.” ""Song Title"" confronts the dichotomy between societal expectations to recover swiftly from a breakup and the reality of enduring heartache.   >   >The single addresses the often silent pressure to heal quickly from heartbreak, contrasting it with the more extended process of true emotional recovery. \Artist Name\ explains, “This song is about the uncomfortable rush society imposes on us to heal.” It extends empathy to those still feeling sad long after a relationship has ended, serving as a reminder that healing is a personal journey.   >   >“Song Title” is not just a single; it is a message that healing takes time and should not be rushed. Through this song, \Artist Name\ connects with those on the arduous path of emotional healing, affirming, “Your feelings are valid and understood.”   >   >Social Links | Media Assets \hyperlinks\   >   >For Inquiries/Press email.com &x200B; **Distributing Press Release - 1.5 Months Before Release** Distribution of your press release is where your contact building comes into play. Utilize the relationships you’ve developed with bloggers, journalists, and writers. Since you’ve taken the time to understand their interests and build rapport, tailor your email or message when sending the press release. Highlight aspects of your release that align with their previous work or interests. Remember that the most impactful connections are those you’ve personally nurtured. These are the individuals who are more likely to give your release the attention it deserves. When you send out the press release, personalize your emails. A personal touch shows that you’re not just sending out a mass email but that you value the recipient's role in the music industry. The goal of the press release is not just to inform, but to tell your story. It’s about presenting your music in a way that resonates with your audience and provides them with everything they need to write a compelling piece about your work. Timing is also critical. Plan to send out your press release 1.5 months in advance of your release date, giving writers and bloggers enough time to cover your music. After sending your press release, it's crucial to follow up effectively without being annoying. Begin by giving recipients a week and a half to review your press release. Then, send a follow-up email, reiterating the key points and offering additional information or answers to questions. The key is to be persistent but not pushy, so if there's no response after one or two follow-ups, it's best to move on. Don’t be that person who comments “Check your DM’s/email” on their socials. &x200B; **Spotify/DSP Pitch** **- 1 Month Before Release** When making your Spotify pitch, consider it as an alternative version to your press release, but tailored specifically for Spotify’s curators. The pitch should convey the unique elements of your music, extracting key parts of your press release such as the story behind the song, its distinctive features, and any inspirations. This ensures consistency in your messaging and leverages the time/effort you’ve already put into crafting your press release. The inclusion of a marketing plan in your pitch is crucial. This plan should detail how you intend to drive engagement and listeners to Spotify. Highlight any promotional activities, social media campaigns, or content strategies that will draw traffic to your track on the platform. The aim is to show Spotify that you are not only invested in promoting your music but also in contributing to keeping users engaged on their platform. This is why optimizing your profile is so important. The most important aspects of pitching are focusing on clarity and relevance. Ensure your pitch is concise, directly addressing why your track would be a good fit for the playlist you’re targeting. It’s important to be genre-specific and align your music with the curator's tastes and the playlist’s theme. You have a limited amount of words to do this, so be smart. What to avoid in a pitch is equally important. Do not use generic statements and exaggerations that don't provide specific information about your music. Avoid making unrealistic claims or comparisons that may set expectations too high. The goal is to be authentic and honest, presenting your music in a way that speaks for itself. In summary, a successful Spotify pitch is a blend of insightful information from your press release, a clear and concise explanation of what makes your track unique, and a solid plan for driving engagement on the platform. It’s about showing Spotify not just the quality of your music, but also your proactive approach to attracting and retaining listeners on their platform. When pitching to Spotify's Editorial Playlist, keep your submission concise, limiting it to 500 characters. Ideally, submit your pitch at least 2 weeks before your release date. This timing increases the likelihood of your track also being included in algorithmic playlists like Release Radar & Radio. When composing your pitch, remember to include the following elements * Always use third-person narration. * Mention the artist's name, their location, and the genres they represent. * Provide details about the track, including insights into the production process, lyrics, sounds, and the emotions it conveys. * Describe your promotion strategy &x200B; *Example 1* &x200B; >""'Ava Grayson', a Denver singer-songwriter, and 'Nova Pulse', a Parisian producer, present 'Whispering Pines', a folk-electronica fusion. Ava's vocals and Nova's Moby-like electronic arrangements have intrigued 'Harmony Records', with promotion planned on NPR's All Songs Considered and across US and French music blogs and radio."" &x200B; *Example 2* &x200B; >""'KRONIK', Miami's bass scene star, collaborates with Tokyo's 'Lunar Echoes' on 'Neon Dreams', a vibrant colorbass track blending pulsating beats and Madeon-style electronics. Garnering 'ElectroGroove Records' interest, it's slated for SiriusXM's BPM and various EDM festivals and blogs in the US and Japan."" &x200B; &x200B; **Amazon Pitch - 1 Month Before Release** While many artists focus primarily on Spotify, it's crucial not to forget about Amazon Music. This platform gets less attention from artists, giving you a potential advantage due to the less crowded space. By using your Spotify strategies on Amazon Music, you can tap into a unique audience segment. Ensure your Amazon Music profile is meticulously updated and fully utilized. This includes leveraging distinctive features like voice intros, which allow you to add a personal touch to your music, and Twitch integrations, catering to the crossover audience between music listeners and gaming communities. Additionally, Amazon Music's less saturated environment compared to Spotify's crowded playlisting space can work in your favor. With fewer artists pitching, your music has a higher chance of standing out and being featured. This approach is not just about diversification; it’s a strategic move to increase visibility where your competition might be lower. Each platform has its audience and quirks, and by not limiting yourself to just one, you increase your chances of reaching a wider, more varied listener base. In the end, while Spotify is undeniably a major player in the music streaming world, leveraging other platforms like Amazon Music can provide you with an edge in a highly competitive market. *^(\*\*Keep in mind that Amazon pitches have a 1000-character limit use it to your advantage to add more details.)* &x200B; **Third-Party Playlist Pitching -** **1 Month Before Release** Investigate and submit your music to relevant Spotify playlists. To find curators, check the playlist's description on Spotify for contact info, or use Google to search for the curator's details. You will be using the same strategy used for obtaining writers/bloggers' contact information. When pitching to a Spotify User Playlist, the approach can vary widely, ranging from an email to an Instagram DM, or even more unconventional methods (Submithub, Weird websites, etc.), depending on the curator's preferred submission process. Discover their guidelines by examining their user profile or the playlist's description. To truly stand out to a user curator, it's crucial to grasp what they're looking for. Do they, have a deep interest in your genre, or are they more financially driven? Regardless, simplicity is key. Avoid getting bogged down in excessive details. Key Points for Your Pitch * Emphasize simplicity, which is always appreciated. * Maintain a kind and friendly tone. * Clearly state your artist name, location, and genre(s). * Briefly describe your track, including production highlights, its distinctive sounds, and the emotions it evokes. * Outline your promotion strategy. If advantageous, include your follower count and monthly listeners; if not, it's better to omit these details. *Example* &x200B; >Hey \Playlist Curator's Name\!   >   >I'm a huge fan of your playlist \Playlist Name\. I wanted to reach out to inquire about your submission process. I've recently worked on a new track that I believe would be a fantastic fit for “playlist name”.   >   >The track, titled ""\Insert Song Title\,"" is a bass-heavy track set to release on \Insert Release Date\. This song holds a special place as it represents \briefly describe the story or inspiration behind the song\. \Decribe track further production/sound-wise\, something I feel would resonate well with the vibe of your playlist.   >   >I'm currently promoting this track across various platforms, including \insert marketing strategy here\. I believe it would add a unique flavor to your collection.   >   >I'd be thrilled if you could spare a moment to listen to it.   >   >Here's the link \Insert Link Here\.   >   >Looking forward to your thoughts. &x200B; **Choosing the Right Playlisting Services** **- 1 Month Before Release** ***If your budget is over $500***, When considering playlisting services, prioritize those that are curated by individuals who value genuine selection overpaid, automatic placements. Opt for services that distribute your track to playlist curators, allowing them to choose whether to include your music based on its merit. It's important to remember that this process is discretionary, much like Spotify's, where curators have the final say in adding or not adding your track to their playlists. This approach ensures a more authentic and potentially rewarding placement for your music. Playlisting is a strategy that broadens your reach, but *its true value is realized only when complemented with consistent, quality music releases and targeted advertising for future projects*. It's about not just capturing an audience, but also maintaining their interest and loyalty over time. I highly recommend not doing playlisting if you do not have additional funds to engage the audience afterward. ***With a budget under $500***, the focus should be on leveraging organic growth and cost-effective strategies. Creating engaging content is key – music videos, behind-the-scenes footage, and interactive social media posts designed to resonate with your audience and encourage shares. This approach helps increase visibility without a heavy reliance on advertising funds. Simultaneously, targeted social media ads can be highly effective. Even small investments in platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok, *when carefully tailored to your target audience* or *placed behind content already performing well organically* can yield significant results. Tapping into existing networks, and collaborating with other artists or fans are cost-efficient ways to expand your reach. Continuously analyze and adapt your strategies based on audience engagement patterns, ensuring that every dollar of your budget is effectively utilized to grow your listener base. &x200B; &x200B; **Post-Release Promotion** **- Ongoing After Release Until Next Release Cycle** Post-release, your focus should shift towards content creation and social media engagement to keep the conversation around your track vibrant. Share updates, user-generated content, reviews, and mentions of your music. Engage your audience with varied content like live performance videos, behind-the-scenes glimpses of the creation process, and discussions about the track's meaning. Remember, the long-term goal is to get picked up by Spotify's algorithm, leading to features in radio stations, discovery playlists, and more. This kind of organic growth can be more valuable than editorial playlisting in the long run, as it signifies a genuine and growing interest in your music. Simultaneously, targeted social media ad campaigns can broaden your reach, drawing in new listeners. Showcasing playlist additions, positive reviews, and fan testimonials can add credibility and pique curiosity, attracting a wider audience. Amid these promotional activities, expressing gratitude plays a crucial role. Thank your fans through various channels, as they are fundamental to your music's success.

Public shoutouts, personalized messages, or mentions in interviews not only show your appreciation but also strengthen your relationships within the music industry. This can pave the way for continued support and coverage for your future releases. In essence, post-release promotion is a balanced mix of maintaining visibility for your track and nurturing the relationships you've built with your audience and industry professionals.

&x200b; **strategic contact research | early relationship building - 3 months before release** building a list of contacts with websites, blogs, and writers' emails is a task that goes beyond “networking”. it's about cultivating genuine relationships (yes, this will be an ongoing theme) with those who can help amplify your music's reach. the goal is not just to gain coverage but to connect with individuals who genuinely resonate with your music and your story. start by researching and identifying websites, blogs, and writers that align with your genre and style. this isn't just about finding any music platform but focusing on those where your music naturally fits. use google or rocketreach, but also explore the social media profiles and personal websites of these writers and bloggers. pay attention to their work, understanding the type of content they produce and the music they typically feature. do not stalk or be weird. keep it professional. when reaching out, personalize your message. reference specific articles or reviews they've written that resonated with you, don’t make shit up. this shows that you're not just sending a mass message but that you give a damn & have taken the time to understand their work and interests. don’t forget these are humans with their own goals and objectives with their writing. you don’t just collaborate with anyone and that is exactly what you are asking of them if you think about it. introduce yourself and your music, but also express interest in their perspectives and insights. this should be done even before you have a release planned. the idea is to start a conversation, not just pitch your music like everyone else. by doing so, you’re laying the groundwork for a relationship based on mutual respect and interest. do not fake relationships, find people you genuinely fuck with, there are tons of writers out there find yours. it’s crucial to ensure that these contacts care about your genre or style. a targeted outreach means that your music finds the right ears, making the conversations more productive and meaningful. once you establish contact, maintain the relationship. comment on their articles, share their work, or engage in discussions about music. this isn't about relentless self-promotion; it’s about being part of a community. you have to show support, it can’t always be a one-way street. when the time comes to send your press release or share your music, it won’t just be another email in their inbox; it’ll be a message from a familiar and respected member of their musical circle. remember, building contacts is a long-term investment. it’s about creating a network of supporters and advocates for you, your project & your music, not just a one-off promotional exchange. this approach not only shows consistency but increases the chances of your music being featured and appreciated while enriching your understanding of the music industry and its key players. &x200b; &x200b; **profile optimization - 3 months before release** remember, the objective of any platform is to keep listeners engaged with your content. this means not just attracting them to your profile but keeping them there with updated, and interactive content. why would spotify give a half-assed profile the spotlight? why would they playlist someone who doesn't give a shit? with spotify's focus on providing an experience, fully fleshed-out profiles that utilize *all available features* and showcase your music's uniqueness are more likely to be highlighted and recommended within the platform. optimizing your spotify profile involves several key elements that ensure your presence on the platform is as compelling and engaging as possible. spotify wants to showcase artist using their platform to its fullest potential. it's essential to keep your profile and cover photos updated regularly, especially with each new release. this visual aspect is crucial as it's often the first impression potential listeners have of your music. your bio is another vital component. it should be more than just a list of achievements or a dry account of your musical history, no one gives a shit. instead, it should tell your story, connecting with listeners and giving them insight into who you are as an artist and what your music represents. adding a “canvas” to every release is crucial, a well-chosen canvas can complement your song's mood, add to its storytelling, and increase engagement, as visually captivating tracks tend to get more shares and saves. a creative and eye-catching canvas that isn’t cookie-cutter could be just the thing that makes someone stop scrolling and start listening.  doing the amazon ""canvas"" equivalent which is voice intros when crafting a press release for your single or album, it’s important to capture your project in a way that engages and informs. you don’t want to be using crazy words, be genuine (literally the key to everything) start with an introductory paragraph that hooks the reader – this could be a brief story about the inspiration behind the album, a notable collaboration, or an interesting aspect of the production. in the body of the press release, provide more detail. this should include background on the making of the album or single, discussion on the lyrics, and any unique features or highlights. if there’s a particular narrative or theme that ties the project together, elaborate on this to give writers and bloggers a deeper understanding of your work. include quotes from yourself or collaborators that provide personal insights into the music. finish with details such as track listings, availability (platforms where the music will be released), and contact information for further inquiries. don’t forget to add links to your music, social media profiles, and any relevant multimedia assets like album art or promotional photos. the length of a press release generally should be about one page, roughly 500-750 words, to ensure it's short yet informative enough to engage the reader. &x200b; *press release example* &x200b; >**“small image of album artwork”**   >   >**unnamed artist - “echoes of heartbreak”**   >   >\short link to stream/dl\   >   >release date \date placeholder\   >   >**\city, state\** – in an expressive release of emotion, \artist name\ presents their latest single ""song title"", a narrative on heartbreak and the personal journey towards recovery. this track, born out of an intense five-hour session with collaborator \collaborator name\, is not only deeply personal but also resonates with a large audience.   >   >facing one of their most challenging breakups, \artist name\ turned to songwriting for comfort, “i felt completely isolated, and this song became a medium for the emotions i was grappling with.” ""song title"" confronts the dichotomy between societal expectations to recover swiftly from a breakup and the reality of enduring heartache.   >   >the single addresses the often silent pressure to heal quickly from heartbreak, contrasting it with the more extended process of true emotional recovery. \artist name\ explains, “this song is about the uncomfortable rush society imposes on us to heal.” it extends empathy to those still feeling sad long after a relationship has ended, serving as a reminder that healing is a personal journey.   >   >“song title” is not just a single; it is a message that healing takes time and should not be rushed. through this song, \artist name\ connects with those on the arduous path of emotional healing, affirming, “your feelings are valid and understood.”   >   >social links | media assets \hyperlinks\   >   >for inquiries/press email.com &x200b; **distributing press release - 1.5 months before release** distribution of your press release is where your contact building comes into play. utilize the relationships you’ve developed with bloggers, journalists, and writers. since you’ve taken the time to understand their interests and build rapport, tailor your email or message when sending the press release. highlight aspects of your release that align with their previous work or interests. remember that the most impactful connections are those you’ve personally nurtured. these are the individuals who are more likely to give your release the attention it deserves. when you send out the press release, personalize your emails. a personal touch shows that you’re not just sending out a mass email but that you value the recipient's role in the music industry. the goal of the press release is not just to inform, but to tell your story. it’s about presenting your music in a way that resonates with your audience and provides them with everything they need to write a compelling piece about your work. timing is also critical. plan to send out your press release 1.5 months in advance of your release date, giving writers and bloggers enough time to cover your music. after sending your press release, it's crucial to follow up effectively without being annoying. begin by giving recipients a week and a half to review your press release. then, send a follow-up email, reiterating the key points and offering additional information or answers to questions. the key is to be persistent but not pushy, so if there's no response after one or two follow-ups, it's best to move on. don’t be that person who comments “check your dm’s/email” on their socials. &x200b; **spotify/dsp pitch** **- 1 month before release** when making your spotify pitch, consider it as an alternative version to your press release, but tailored specifically for spotify’s curators. the pitch should convey the unique elements of your music, extracting key parts of your press release such as the story behind the song, its distinctive features, and any inspirations. this ensures consistency in your messaging and leverages the time/effort you’ve already put into crafting your press release. the inclusion of a marketing plan in your pitch is crucial. this plan should detail how you intend to drive engagement and listeners to spotify. highlight any promotional activities, social media campaigns, or content strategies that will draw traffic to your track on the platform. the aim is to show spotify that you are not only invested in promoting your music but also in contributing to keeping users engaged on their platform. this is why optimizing your profile is so important. the most important aspects of pitching are focusing on clarity and relevance. ensure your pitch is concise, directly addressing why your track would be a good fit for the playlist you’re targeting. it’s important to be genre-specific and align your music with the curator's tastes and the playlist’s theme. you have a limited amount of words to do this, so be smart. what to avoid in a pitch is equally important. do not use generic statements and exaggerations that don't provide specific information about your music. avoid making unrealistic claims or comparisons that may set expectations too high. the goal is to be authentic and honest, presenting your music in a way that speaks for itself. in summary, a successful spotify pitch is a blend of insightful information from your press release, a clear and concise explanation of what makes your track unique, and a solid plan for driving engagement on the platform. it’s about showing spotify not just the quality of your music, but also your proactive approach to attracting and retaining listeners on their platform. when pitching to spotify's editorial playlist, keep your submission concise, limiting it to 500 characters. ideally, submit your pitch at least 2 weeks before your release date. this timing increases the likelihood of your track also being included in algorithmic playlists like release radar & radio. when composing your pitch, remember to include the following elements * always use third-person narration. * mention the artist's name, their location, and the genres they represent. * provide details about the track, including insights into the production process, lyrics, sounds, and the emotions it conveys. * describe your promotion strategy &x200b; *example 1* &x200b; >""'ava grayson', a denver singer-songwriter, and 'nova pulse', a parisian producer, present 'whispering pines', a folk-electronica fusion. ava's vocals and nova's moby-like electronic arrangements have intrigued 'harmony records', with promotion planned on npr's all songs considered and across us and french music blogs and radio."" &x200b; *example 2* &x200b; >""'kronik', miami's bass scene star, collaborates with tokyo's 'lunar echoes' on 'neon dreams', a vibrant colorbass track blending pulsating beats and madeon-style electronics. garnering 'electrogroove records' interest, it's slated for siriusxm's bpm and various edm festivals and blogs in the us and japan."" &x200b; &x200b; **amazon pitch - 1 month before release** while many artists focus primarily on spotify, it's crucial not to forget about amazon music. this platform gets less attention from artists, giving you a potential advantage due to the less crowded space. by using your spotify strategies on amazon music, you can tap into a unique audience segment. ensure your amazon music profile is meticulously updated and fully utilized. this includes leveraging distinctive features like voice intros, which allow you to add a personal touch to your music, and twitch integrations, catering to the crossover audience between music listeners and gaming communities. additionally, amazon music's less saturated environment compared to spotify's crowded playlisting space can work in your favor. with fewer artists pitching, your music has a higher chance of standing out and being featured. this approach is not just about diversification; it’s a strategic move to increase visibility where your competition might be lower. each platform has its audience and quirks, and by not limiting yourself to just one, you increase your chances of reaching a wider, more varied listener base. in the end, while spotify is undeniably a major player in the music streaming world, leveraging other platforms like amazon music can provide you with an edge in a highly competitive market. *^(\*\*keep in mind that amazon pitches have a 1000-character limit use it to your advantage to add more details.)* &x200b; **third-party playlist pitching -** **1 month before release** investigate and submit your music to relevant spotify playlists. to find curators, check the playlist's description on spotify for contact info, or use google to search for the curator's details. you will be using the same strategy used for obtaining writers/bloggers' contact information. when pitching to a spotify user playlist, the approach can vary widely, ranging from an email to an instagram dm, or even more unconventional methods (submithub, weird websites, etc.), depending on the curator's preferred submission process. discover their guidelines by examining their user profile or the playlist's description. to truly stand out to a user curator, it's crucial to grasp what they're looking for. do they, have a deep interest in your genre, or are they more financially driven? regardless, simplicity is key. avoid getting bogged down in excessive details. key points for your pitch * emphasize simplicity, which is always appreciated. * maintain a kind and friendly tone. * clearly state your artist name, location, and genre(s). * briefly describe your track, including production highlights, its distinctive sounds, and the emotions it evokes. * outline your promotion strategy. if advantageous, include your follower count and monthly listeners; if not, it's better to omit these details. *example* &x200b; >hey \playlist curator's name\!   >   >i'm a huge fan of your playlist \playlist name\. i wanted to reach out to inquire about your submission process. i've recently worked on a new track that i believe would be a fantastic fit for “playlist name”.   >   >the track, titled ""\insert song title\,"" is a bass-heavy track set to release on \insert release date\. this song holds a special place as it represents \briefly describe the story or inspiration behind the song\. \decribe track further production/sound-wise\, something i feel would resonate well with the vibe of your playlist.   >   >i'm currently promoting this track across various platforms, including \insert marketing strategy here\. i believe it would add a unique flavor to your collection.   >   >i'd be thrilled if you could spare a moment to listen to it.   >   >here's the link \insert link here\.   >   >looking forward to your thoughts. &x200b; **choosing the right playlisting services** **- 1 month before release** ***if your budget is over $500***, when considering playlisting services, prioritize those that are curated by individuals who value genuine selection overpaid, automatic placements. opt for services that distribute your track to playlist curators, allowing them to choose whether to include your music based on its merit. it's important to remember that this process is discretionary, much like spotify's, where curators have the final say in adding or not adding your track to their playlists. this approach ensures a more authentic and potentially rewarding placement for your music. playlisting is a strategy that broadens your reach, but *its true value is realized only when complemented with consistent, quality music releases and targeted advertising for future projects*. it's about not just capturing an audience, but also maintaining their interest and loyalty over time. i highly recommend not doing playlisting if you do not have additional funds to engage the audience afterward. ***with a budget under $500***, the focus should be on leveraging organic growth and cost-effective strategies. creating engaging content is key – music videos, behind-the-scenes footage, and interactive social media posts designed to resonate with your audience and encourage shares. this approach helps increase visibility without a heavy reliance on advertising funds. simultaneously, targeted social media ads can be highly effective. even small investments in platforms like facebook, instagram, or tiktok, *when carefully tailored to your target audience* or *placed behind content already performing well organically* can yield significant results. tapping into existing networks, and collaborating with other artists or fans are cost-efficient ways to expand your reach. continuously analyze and adapt your strategies based on audience engagement patterns, ensuring that every dollar of your budget is effectively utilized to grow your listener base. &x200b; &x200b; **post-release promotion** **- ongoing after release until next release cycle** post-release, your focus should shift towards content creation and social media engagement to keep the conversation around your track vibrant. share updates, user-generated content, reviews, and mentions of your music. engage your audience with varied content like live performance videos, behind-the-scenes glimpses of the creation process, and discussions about the track's meaning. remember, the long-term goal is to get picked up by spotify's algorithm, leading to features in radio stations, discovery playlists, and more. this kind of organic growth can be more valuable than editorial playlisting in the long run, as it signifies a genuine and growing interest in your music. simultaneously, targeted social media ad campaigns can broaden your reach, drawing in new listeners. showcasing playlist additions, positive reviews, and fan testimonials can add credibility and pique curiosity, attracting a wider audience. amid these promotional activities, expressing gratitude plays a crucial role. thank your fans through various channels, as they are fundamental to your music's success. consider personal engagement strategies, like live q&a sessions, thank-you emails, or special content dedicated to fans. this appreciation helps fortify their loyalty and encourages ongoing support. equally important is acknowledging the playlists, writers, and bloggers who supported your release. public shoutouts, personalized messages, or mentions in interviews not only show your appreciation but also strengthen your relationships within the music industry. this can pave the way for continued support and coverage for your future releases. in essence, post-release promotion is a balanced mix of maintaining visibility for your track and nurturing the relationships you've built with your audience and industry professionals. by combining ongoing engagement with a heartfelt expression of gratitude, you set a foundation for sustained growth and support in your musical journey. &x200b;

↑ ***rinse and repeat***  ↑ &x200b; if you are still facing problems with obtaining streams then it might be time to go back to the studio and clean things up or check on your content. this may seem harsh, but the truth is that spotify is giving you access to millions of people who otherwise you would need to hit the streets to acquire. just because you don’t have to pass out mixtapes in 2024, doesn’t mean that you don’t have to put in the work. the platforms dsps offer give you a chance to reach a global audience. this guide won't guarantee you being playlisted but it will greatly improve your chances. thank you for making it this far.  if you still need help, i don’t mean “i want someone to do everything for me” help, feel free to reach out.",12,4157

1aeeuoq,1706585712.0,musicmarketing,Chrissy_boy,Anyone have advice when you're in a marketing stalemate and the streams stop coming in?,"For context, this is in the rock genre, and my song is technically a success, but the streams just stopped coming in. It hit release radar and discover weekly, however it is not preforming as well as I thought it should based on Spotifys algorithmic expectations. It has a 31% popularity score and currently has 10,700 streams. It did well on releaser radar for a week and got me like 4k or more streams, but the next week just dipped horribly to only like a few hundred for the week. It finally creeped up to 30% and hit discover weekly but is only doing 25 streams a day on DW, which I feel like is because people aren't listening all the way through, even though I have 450 saves and my followers are going up 5 a day and at 285 now.

I used submithub which helped me get into some playlists, and I used playlist supply which wasn't helpful, and I am checking other playlists on [artist.tools](https://artist.tools/). I am also running Facebook ads based on Andrew Southworth, which I'm pretty sure is not working the way he explains it should. I have a ""fans also like"" section that seems so random and not really super in touch with the music I make so I have no idea if that is why things aren't moving like I thought they would. I am confused and not sure why this song isn't doing better based on the data.

I've been finding myself commenting the same couple of things under each ""help"" me post so I decided to give this sub a condensed version of what tell my artists &amp; clients.  This is a basic roadmap covering critical aspects of a music release – from the initial stages of preparing and strategizing your release to post-release promotion. 

Please remember that without a REAL connection with your fan base, you will not achieve anything, this means treating them as humans not just dumping your songs onto them. Make it enjoyable to watch your videos, images, etc. BE AUTHENTIC IN YOUR CONTENT. I can’t stress this enough, the same way you can spot disingenuous content, they can also. Stop with the bullshit tacky “coming out soon” videos, listen now posts, etc. Make exciting content that showcases your AUTHENTIC self.  

I don't want to hear your complaints about Spotify &amp; social media being the devil. If you want to be a studio musician or work in sync, that's cool, I support it but this isn't for you.  

For those trying to gain an audience, I hope this serves you well. 

Cheers

**Pre-Release Preparation- 3 Months Before Release**

Creating an effective Pre-Release Content Strategy involves a balance. It's about generating excitement and anticipation for your release without falling into the trap of making your content feel like just another shitty artist trying to peddle their music. *Everyone* is constantly bombarded with ads, the challenge lies in crafting content that stands out by being authentic and engaging, rather than just another look at me, play my music, me me me post.

The key is to focus on storytelling and genuine engagement. Share the story behind your music, not just the end product. This could include a behind-the-scenes breakdown into your creative process, the ups and downs of making music, and personal hobbies that give your audience a window into your world as an artist. By doing so, you're not only building anticipation for your release but also forging a deeper connection with your audience. Be yourself, why would you want people to like a fake version of you? You will hate yourself for having to uphold an image that isn’t you. 

Incorporate elements like teaser videos or studio session snippets, but ensure they are more than just basic previews. They should invite your audience into your world, offering a taste of your upcoming work while also providing value in themselves. This could be through the emotion they evoke, the story they tell, or the unique perspective they offer.

It's crucial to interact with your audience rather than just broadcast to them. Engage them in conversations, ask for their opinions, and make them feel like a part of your musical journey because guess what? They are! Your goal is to transform your audience from passive listeners to active participants. These will be the ones that buy tickets, merch, engage on posts, and anticipate future releases. 

Your Pre-Release Content Strategy should not only aim to inform your audience about your upcoming release but also to connect with them on a human level. Make your content so engaging and authentic that it stands out amidst the crap you probably complain about getting more attention, don’t make advertisements, create a meaningful and intriguing glimpse into who you are.

**Strategic Contact Research | Early Relationship Building - +3 Months Before Release**

Building a list of contacts with websites, blogs, and writers' emails is a task that goes beyond “networking”. It's about cultivating genuine relationships (yes, this will be an ongoing theme) with those who can help amplify your music's reach. The goal is not just to gain coverage but to connect with individuals who genuinely resonate with your music and your story.

Start by researching and identifying websites, blogs, and writers that align with your genre and style. This isn't just about finding any music platform but focusing on those where your music naturally fits. Use Google or Rocketreach, but also explore the social media profiles and personal websites of these writers and bloggers. Pay attention to their work, understanding the type of content they produce and the music they typically feature. Do not stalk or be weird. Keep it professional. 

When reaching out, personalize your message. Reference specific articles or reviews they've written that resonated with you, don’t make shit up. This shows that you're not just sending a mass message but that you give a damn &amp; have taken the time to understand their work and interests. Don’t forget these are humans with their own goals and objectives with their writing. You don’t just collaborate with anyone and that is exactly what you are asking of them if you think about it. 

Introduce yourself and your music, but also express interest in their perspectives and insights. This should be done even before you have a release planned. The idea is to start a conversation, not just pitch your music like everyone else. By doing so, you’re laying the groundwork for a relationship based on mutual respect and interest. DO NOT FAKE RELATIONSHIPS, find people you genuinely fuck with, there are tons of writers out there find yours.  

It’s crucial to ensure that these contacts care about your genre or style. A targeted outreach means that your music finds the right ears, making the conversations more productive and meaningful. 

Once you establish contact, maintain the relationship. Comment on their articles, share their work, or engage in discussions about music. This isn't about relentless self-promotion; it’s about being part of a community. You have to show support, it can’t always be a one-way street. When the time comes to send your press release or share your music, it won’t just be another email in their inbox; it’ll be a message from a familiar and respected member of their musical circle.

Remember, building contacts is a long-term investment. It’s about creating a network of supporters and advocates for you, your project &amp; your music, not just a one-off promotional exchange. This approach not only shows consistency but increases the chances of your music being featured and appreciated while enriching your understanding of the music industry and its key players.

**Profile Optimization - 3 Months Before Release\***

Remember, the objective of ANY PLATFORM is to keep listeners engaged with your content. This means not just attracting them to your profile but keeping them there with updated, and interactive content. Why would Spotify give a half-assed profile the spotlight? Why would they playlist someone who doesn't give a shit? 

With Spotify's focus on providing an experience, fully fleshed-out profiles that utilize *all available features* and showcase your music's uniqueness are more likely to be highlighted and recommended within the platform.

Optimizing your Spotify profile involves several key elements that ensure your presence on the platform is as compelling and engaging as possible. Spotify wants to showcase artist using their platform to its fullest potential. 

It's essential to keep your profile and cover photos updated regularly, especially with each new release. This visual aspect is crucial as it's often the first impression potential listeners have of your music. Your bio is another vital component. It should be more than just a list of achievements or a dry account of your musical history, no one gives a shit. Instead, it should tell your story, connecting with listeners and giving them insight into who you are as an artist and what your music represents. 

Adding a “Canvas” to every release is crucial, A well-chosen Canvas can complement your song's mood, add to its storytelling, and increase engagement, as visually captivating tracks tend to get more shares and saves. A creative and eye-catching Canvas that isn’t cookie-cutter could be just the thing that makes someone stop scrolling and start listening.  Doing the Amazon ""canvas"" equivalent which is [voice intros](https://artists.amazonmusic.com/new-release-intro).  

The integration of lyrics through [Musixmatch](https://pro.musixmatch.com/) is an often-overlooked feature. By syncing your lyrics, you enhance the listener's experience, allowing them to connect more deeply with your songs &amp; share snippets on socials. 

Use Spotify's 'Clips' feature. This tool allows you to add short video clips to your tracks, providing a visual element that can enhance listener engagement and showcase your music's personality. 

Linking merchandise to your profile is also an important aspect of optimization. It not only offers fans a way to support you but also adds another layer of professionalism to your profile.

Display your tour/show dates with [Songkick Tourbox](https://tourbox.songkick.com/).

All of these things will make your profile a “model Spotify Artist” &amp; one they won't hesitate to promote/highlight/showcase. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Press Release - 2 Months Before Release\***  
^(\[We are assuming that you have your final Master &amp; have distributed it at this point; this needs to be done WELL in advance, not a few weeks before so you have access to pitching\]) 

When crafting a press release for your single or album, it’s important to capture your project in a way that engages and informs. You don’t want to be using crazy words, be GENUINE (literally the key to everything) Start with an introductory paragraph that hooks the reader – this could be a brief story about the inspiration behind the album, a notable collaboration, or an interesting aspect of the production. 

In the body of the press release, provide more detail. This should include background on the making of the album or single, discussion on the lyrics, and any unique features or highlights. If there’s a particular narrative or theme that ties the project together, elaborate on this to give writers and bloggers a deeper understanding of your work. Include quotes from yourself or collaborators that provide personal insights into the music. 

Finish with details such as track listings, availability (platforms where the music will be released), and contact information for further inquiries. 

Don’t forget to add links to your music, social media profiles, and any relevant multimedia assets like album art or promotional photos. 

The length of a press release generally should be about one page, roughly 500-750 words, to ensure it's short yet informative enough to engage the reader.  


&gt;*Press Release Example:*   
  
&gt;  
&gt;**“SMALL IMAGE OF ALBUM ARTWORK”**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Unnamed Artist - “Echoes of Heartbreak”**   
&gt;  
&gt;\[short link to stream/DL\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Release Date: \[Date Placeholder\]  
&gt;  
&gt;**\[City, State\]** – In an expressive release of emotion, \[Artist Name\] presents their latest single ""Song Title"", a narrative on heartbreak and the personal journey towards recovery. This track, born out of an intense five-hour session with collaborator \[Collaborator Name\], is not only deeply personal but also resonates with a large audience.  
&gt;  
&gt;Facing one of their most challenging breakups, \[Artist Name\] turned to songwriting for comfort, “I felt completely isolated, and this song became a medium for the emotions I was grappling with.” ""Song Title"" confronts the dichotomy between societal expectations to recover swiftly from a breakup and the reality of enduring heartache.  
&gt;  
&gt;The single addresses the often silent pressure to heal quickly from heartbreak, contrasting it with the more extended process of true emotional recovery. \[Artist Name\] explains, “This song is about the uncomfortable rush society imposes on us to heal.” It extends empathy to those still feeling sad long after a relationship has ended, serving as a reminder that healing is a personal journey.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Song Title” is not just a single; it is a message that healing takes time and should not be rushed. Through this song, \[Artist Name\] connects with those on the arduous path of emotional healing, affirming, “Your feelings are valid and understood.”

&amp;#x200B;

  
**Distributing Press Release - 1.5 Months Before Release**

Distribution of your press release is where your contact building comes into play. Utilize the relationships you’ve developed with bloggers, journalists, and writers. Since you’ve taken the time to understand their interests and build rapport, tailor your email or message when sending the press release. Highlight aspects of your release that align with their previous work or interests. 

Remember that the most impactful connections are those you’ve personally nurtured. These are the individuals who are more likely to give your release the attention it deserves. When you send out the press release, personalize your emails. A personal touch shows that you’re not just sending out a mass email but that you value the recipient's role in the music industry. 

The goal of the press release is not just to inform, but to tell your story. It’s about presenting your music in a way that resonates with your audience and provides them with everything they need to write a compelling piece about your work.

Timing is also critical. Plan to send out your press release 1.5 months in advance of your release date, giving writers and bloggers enough time to cover your music. 

After sending your press release, it's crucial to follow up effectively without being annoying. Begin by giving recipients a week and a half to review your press release. Then, send a follow-up email, reiterating the key points and offering additional information or answers to questions. The key is to be persistent but not pushy, so if there's no response after one or two follow-ups, it's best to move on. 

Don’t be that person who comments “Check your DM’s/email” on their socials.  


&amp;#x200B;

**Spotify/DSP Pitch** **- 1 Month Before Release**

When making your Spotify pitch, consider it as an alternative version to your press release, but tailored specifically for Spotify’s curators. The pitch should convey the unique elements of your music, extracting key parts of your press release such as the story behind the song, its distinctive features, and any inspirations. This ensures consistency in your messaging and leverages the time/effort you’ve already put into crafting your press release.

The inclusion of a marketing plan in your pitch is crucial. This plan should detail how you intend to drive engagement and listeners to Spotify. Highlight any promotional activities, social media campaigns, or content strategies that will draw traffic to your track on the platform. The aim is to show Spotify that you are not only invested in promoting your music but also in contributing to keeping users engaged on their platform. This is why optimizing your profile is so important.

The most important aspects of pitching are focusing on clarity and relevance. Ensure your pitch is concise, directly addressing why your track would be a good fit for the playlist you’re targeting. It’s important to be genre-specific and align your music with the curator's tastes and the playlist’s theme. You have a limited amount of words to do this, so be smart. 

What to avoid in a pitch is equally important. Do not use generic statements and exaggerations that don't provide specific information about your music. Avoid making unrealistic claims or comparisons that may set expectations too high. The goal is to be authentic and honest, presenting your music in a way that speaks for itself.

In summary, a successful Spotify pitch is a blend of insightful information from your press release, a clear and concise explanation of what makes your track unique, and a solid plan for driving engagement on the platform. It’s about showing Spotify not just the quality of your music, but also your proactive approach to attracting and retaining listeners on their platform.

When pitching to Spotify's Editorial Playlist, keep your submission concise, limiting it to 500 characters. Ideally, submit your pitch at least 2 weeks before your release date. This timing increases the likelihood of your track also being included in algorithmic playlists like Release Radar &amp; Radio. 

When composing your pitch, remember to include the following elements:

* Always use third-person narration.
* Mention the artist's name, their location, and the genres they represent.
* Provide details about the track, including insights into the production process, lyrics, sounds, and the emotions it conveys.
* Describe your promotion strategy

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*Example 1:*  
&gt;  
&gt;""'Ava Grayson', a Denver singer-songwriter, and 'Nova Pulse', a Parisian producer, present 'Whispering Pines', a folk-electronica fusion. Ava's vocals and Nova's Moby-like electronic arrangements have intrigued 'Harmony Records', with promotion planned on NPR's All Songs Considered and across US and French music blogs and radio.""  
&gt;  
&gt;*Example 2:*   
&gt;  
&gt;""'KRONIK', Miami's bass scene star, collaborates with Tokyo's 'Lunar Echoes' on 'Neon Dreams', a vibrant colorbass track blending pulsating beats and Madeon-style electronics. Garnering 'ElectroGroove Records' interest, it's slated for SiriusXM's BPM and various EDM festivals and blogs in the US and Japan.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Amazon Pitch - 1 Month Before Release**

While many artists focus primarily on Spotify, it's crucial not to forget about Amazon Music. This platform gets less attention from artists, giving you a potential advantage due to the less crowded space. By using your Spotify strategies on Amazon Music, you can tap into a unique audience segment. Ensure your Amazon Music profile is meticulously updated and fully utilized. 

This includes leveraging distinctive features like voice intros, which allow you to add a personal touch to your music, and Twitch integrations, catering to the crossover audience between music listeners and gaming communities.

Additionally, Amazon Music's less saturated environment compared to Spotify's crowded playlisting space can work in your favor. With fewer artists pitching, your music has a higher chance of standing out and being featured. This approach is not just about diversification; it’s a strategic move to increase visibility where your competition might be lower.

Each platform has its audience and quirks, and by not limiting yourself to just one, you increase your chances of reaching a wider, more varied listener base. In the end, while Spotify is undeniably a major player in the music streaming world, leveraging other platforms like Amazon Music can provide you with an edge in a highly competitive market.

*^(\*\*Keep in mind that Amazon pitches have a 1000-character limit use it to your advantage to add more details.)*  


&amp;#x200B;

 **Third-Party Playlist Pitching -** **1 Month Before Release**

Investigate and submit your music to relevant Spotify playlists. To find curators, check the playlist's description on Spotify for contact info, or use Google to search for the curator's details. You will be using the same strategy used for obtaining writers/bloggers' contact information.

When pitching to a Spotify User Playlist, the approach can vary widely, ranging from an email to an Instagram DM, or even more unconventional methods (Submithub, Weird websites, etc.), depending on the curator's preferred submission process. Discover their guidelines by examining their user profile or the playlist's description. 

To truly stand out to a user curator, it's crucial to grasp what they're looking for. Do they, have a deep interest in your genre, or are they more financially driven? 

Regardless, simplicity is key. Avoid getting bogged down in excessive details.

Key Points for Your Pitch:

* Emphasize simplicity, which is always appreciated.
* Maintain a kind and friendly tone.
* Clearly state your artist name, location, and genre(s).
* Briefly describe your track, including production highlights, its distinctive sounds, and the emotions it evokes.
* Outline your promotion strategy. If advantageous, include your follower count and monthly listeners; if not, it's better to omit these details.  


&gt;Example:  
&gt;  
&gt;Hey \[Playlist Curator's Name\]!  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm a huge fan of your playlist \[Playlist Name\]. I wanted to reach out to inquire about your submission process. I've recently worked on a new track that I believe would be a fantastic fit for “playlist name”.  
&gt;  
&gt;The track, titled ""\[Insert Song Title\],"" is a bass-heavy track set to release on \[Insert Release Date\]. This song holds a special place as it represents \[briefly describe the story or inspiration behind the song\]. \[Decribe track further production/sound-wise\], something I feel would resonate well with the vibe of your playlist.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm currently promoting this track across various platforms, including \[insert marketing strategy here\]. I believe it would add a unique flavor to your collection.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'd be thrilled if you could spare a moment to listen to it. Here's the link: \[Insert Link Here\].  
&gt;  
&gt;Looking forward to your thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

 **Choosing the Right Playlisting Services** **- 1 Month Before Release**

***If your budget is over $500***, When considering playlisting services, prioritize those that are curated by individuals who value genuine selection overpaid, automatic placements. Opt for services that distribute your track to playlist curators, allowing them to choose whether to include your music based on its merit. It's important to remember that this process is discretionary, much like Spotify's, where curators have the final say in adding or not adding your track to their playlists. This approach ensures a more authentic and potentially rewarding placement for your music. Playlisting is a strategy that broadens your reach, but *its true value is realized only when complemented with consistent, quality music releases and targeted advertising for future projects*. It's about not just capturing an audience, but also maintaining their interest and loyalty over time. I highly recommend not doing playlisting if you do not have additional funds to engage the audience afterward. 

***With a budget under $500***, the focus should be on leveraging organic growth and cost-effective strategies. Creating engaging content is key – music videos, behind-the-scenes footage, and interactive social media posts designed to resonate with your audience and encourage shares. This approach helps increase visibility without a heavy reliance on advertising funds. Simultaneously, targeted social media ads can be highly effective. Even small investments in platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok, *when carefully tailored to your target audience* or *placed behind content already performing well organically* can yield significant results. Tapping into existing networks, and collaborating with other artists or fans are cost-efficient ways to expand your reach. Continuously analyze and adapt your strategies based on audience engagement patterns, ensuring that every dollar of your budget is effectively utilized to grow your listener base.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 **Post-Release Promotion** **- Ongoing After Release Until Next Release Cycle**  
 

Post-release, your focus should shift towards content creation and social media engagement to keep the conversation around your track vibrant. Share updates, user-generated content, reviews, and mentions of your music. Engage your audience with varied content like live performance videos, behind-the-scenes glimpses of the creation process, and discussions about the track's meaning. 

Remember, the long-term goal is to get picked up by Spotify's algorithm, leading to features in radio stations, discovery playlists, and more. This kind of organic growth can be more valuable than editorial playlisting in the long run, as it signifies a genuine and growing interest in your music.

Simultaneously, targeted social media ad campaigns can broaden your reach, drawing in new listeners. Showcasing playlist additions, positive reviews, and fan testimonials can add credibility and pique curiosity, attracting a wider audience.

Amid these promotional activities, expressing gratitude plays a crucial role. Thank your fans through various channels, as they are fundamental to your music's success. Consider personal engagement strategies, like live Q&amp;A sessions, thank-you emails, or special content dedicated to fans. This appreciation helps fortify their loyalty and encourages ongoing support.

Equally important is acknowledging the playlists, writers, and bloggers who supported your release. Public shoutouts, personalized messages, or mentions in interviews not only show your appreciation but also strengthen your relationships within the music industry. This can pave the way for continued support and coverage for your future releases.

In essence, post-release promotion is a balanced mix of maintaining visibility for your track and nurturing the relationships you've built with your audience and industry professionals. By combining ongoing engagement with a heartfelt expression of gratitude, you set a foundation for sustained growth and support in your musical journey.

I will not be providing resources to third-party playlisting services since most offered online are not legitimate &amp; their performances vary with each genre &amp; campaign. Quality tends to decline pretty quickly since platforms start seeing $$ over integrity. For an up-to-date list of recommended playlist services or individuals feel free to reach out.  I'm happy to provide these, I just don't want this post to stay here praising them and not be updated if their quality drops. 

What I will provide is a link to a tool that will help assist you in seeing bot activity on playlists to verify the legitimacy this can be found here: [https://www.artist.tools](https://www.artist.tools/) 

I *highly recommend* auditing any playlist/playlister you plan on working with before your campaign.

If you are still facing problems with obtaining streams then it might be time to go back to the studio and clean things up (or check on your content). This may seem harsh, but the truth is that Spotify is giving you access to millions of people who otherwise you would need to hit the streets to acquire. Just because you don’t have to pass out mixtapes in 2023, doesn’t mean that you don’t have to put in the work. The platforms DSPs offer give you a chance to reach a global audience. This guide won't guarantee you being playlisted but it will greatly improve your chances.    


Thank you for making it this far, I appreciate you for making me feel like I didn't waste my Sunday trying to help others.  If you still need help, I don’t mean “I want someone to do everything for me” help, feel free to reach out.  ",1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicmarketing/comments/1ad696v/here_is_my_guide_to_spotify_other_dsps_releases/,"Here is my guide to Spotify, other DSPs & releases in general.","here is my guide to spotify, other dsps & releases in general.","&x200B; I've been finding myself commenting the same couple of things under each ""help"" me post so I decided to give this sub a condensed version of what tell my artists & clients.  This is a basic roadmap covering critical aspects of a music release – from the initial stages of preparing and strategizing your release to post-release promotion.  Please remember that without a REAL connection with your fan base, you will not achieve anything, this means treating them as humans not just dumping your songs onto them. Make it enjoyable to watch your videos, images, etc. BE AUTHENTIC IN YOUR CONTENT. I can’t stress this enough, the same way you can spot disingenuous content, they can also. Stop with the bullshit tacky “coming out soon” videos, listen now posts, etc. Make exciting content that showcases your AUTHENTIC self.   I don't want to hear your complaints about Spotify & social media being the devil. If you want to be a studio musician or work in sync, that's cool, I support it but this isn't for you.   For those trying to gain an audience, I hope this serves you well.  Cheers &x200B; &x200B; **Pre-Release Preparation- 3 Months Before Release** Creating an effective Pre-Release Content Strategy involves a balance. It's about generating excitement and anticipation for your release without falling into the trap of making your content feel like just another shitty artist trying to peddle their music. *Everyone* is constantly bombarded with ads, the challenge lies in crafting content that stands out by being authentic and engaging, rather than just another look at me, play my music, me me me post. The key is to focus on storytelling and genuine engagement. Share the story behind your music, not just the end product. This could include a behind-the-scenes breakdown into your creative process, the ups and downs of making music, and personal hobbies that give your audience a window into your world as an artist. By doing so, you're not only building anticipation for your release but also forging a deeper connection with your audience. Be yourself, why would you want people to like a fake version of you? You will hate yourself for having to uphold an image that isn’t you.  Incorporate elements like teaser videos or studio session snippets, but ensure they are more than just basic previews. They should invite your audience into your world, offering a taste of your upcoming work while also providing value in themselves. This could be through the emotion they evoke, the story they tell, or the unique perspective they offer. It's crucial to interact with your audience rather than just broadcast to them. Engage them in conversations, ask for their opinions, and make them feel like a part of your musical journey because guess what? They are! Your goal is to transform your audience from passive listeners to active participants. These will be the ones that buy tickets, merch, engage on posts, and anticipate future releases.  Your Pre-Release Content Strategy should not only aim to inform your audience about your upcoming release but also to connect with them on a human level. Make your content so engaging and authentic that it stands out amidst the crap you probably complain about getting more attention, don’t make advertisements, create a meaningful and intriguing glimpse into who you are. &x200B; &x200B; **Strategic Contact Research | Early Relationship Building - 3 Months Before Release** Building a list of contacts with websites, blogs, and writers' emails is a task that goes beyond “networking”. It's about cultivating genuine relationships (yes, this will be an ongoing theme) with those who can help amplify your music's reach. The goal is not just to gain coverage but to connect with individuals who genuinely resonate with your music and your story. Start by researching and identifying websites, blogs, and writers that align with your genre and style. This isn't just about finding any music platform but focusing on those where your music naturally fits. Use Google or Rocketreach, but also explore the social media profiles and personal websites of these writers and bloggers. Pay attention to their work, understanding the type of content they produce and the music they typically feature. Do not stalk or be weird. Keep it professional.  When reaching out, personalize your message. Reference specific articles or reviews they've written that resonated with you, don’t make shit up. This shows that you're not just sending a mass message but that you give a damn & have taken the time to understand their work and interests. Don’t forget these are humans with their own goals and objectives with their writing. You don’t just collaborate with anyone and that is exactly what you are asking of them if you think about it.  Introduce yourself and your music, but also express interest in their perspectives and insights. This should be done even before you have a release planned. The idea is to start a conversation, not just pitch your music like everyone else. By doing so, you’re laying the groundwork for a relationship based on mutual respect and interest. DO NOT FAKE RELATIONSHIPS, find people you genuinely fuck with, there are tons of writers out there find yours.   It’s crucial to ensure that these contacts care about your genre or style. A targeted outreach means that your music finds the right ears, making the conversations more productive and meaningful.  Once you establish contact, maintain the relationship. Comment on their articles, share their work, or engage in discussions about music. This isn't about relentless self-promotion; it’s about being part of a community. You have to show support, it can’t always be a one-way street. When the time comes to send your press release or share your music, it won’t just be another email in their inbox; it’ll be a message from a familiar and respected member of their musical circle. Remember, building contacts is a long-term investment. It’s about creating a network of supporters and advocates for you, your project & your music, not just a one-off promotional exchange. This approach not only shows consistency but increases the chances of your music being featured and appreciated while enriching your understanding of the music industry and its key players. &x200B; &x200B; **Profile Optimization - 3 Months Before Release\*** Remember, the objective of ANY PLATFORM is to keep listeners engaged with your content. This means not just attracting them to your profile but keeping them there with updated, and interactive content. Why would Spotify give a half-assed profile the spotlight? Why would they playlist someone who doesn't give a shit?  With Spotify's focus on providing an experience, fully fleshed-out profiles that utilize *all available features* and showcase your music's uniqueness are more likely to be highlighted and recommended within the platform. Optimizing your Spotify profile involves several key elements that ensure your presence on the platform is as compelling and engaging as possible. Spotify wants to showcase artist using their platform to its fullest potential.  It's essential to keep your profile and cover photos updated regularly, especially with each new release. This visual aspect is crucial as it's often the first impression potential listeners have of your music. Your bio is another vital component. It should be more than just a list of achievements or a dry account of your musical history, no one gives a shit. Instead, it should tell your story, connecting with listeners and giving them insight into who you are as an artist and what your music represents.  Adding a “Canvas” to every release is crucial, A well-chosen Canvas can complement your song's mood, add to its storytelling, and increase engagement, as visually captivating tracks tend to get more shares and saves. A creative and eye-catching Canvas that isn’t cookie-cutter could be just the thing that makes someone stop scrolling and start listening.  Doing the Amazon ""canvas"" equivalent which is voice intros  When crafting a press release for your single or album, it’s important to capture your project in a way that engages and informs. You don’t want to be using crazy words, be GENUINE (literally the key to everything) Start with an introductory paragraph that hooks the reader – this could be a brief story about the inspiration behind the album, a notable collaboration, or an interesting aspect of the production.  In the body of the press release, provide more detail. This should include background on the making of the album or single, discussion on the lyrics, and any unique features or highlights. If there’s a particular narrative or theme that ties the project together, elaborate on this to give writers and bloggers a deeper understanding of your work. Include quotes from yourself or collaborators that provide personal insights into the music.  Finish with details such as track listings, availability (platforms where the music will be released), and contact information for further inquiries.  Don’t forget to add links to your music, social media profiles, and any relevant multimedia assets like album art or promotional photos.  The length of a press release generally should be about one page, roughly 500-750 words, to ensure it's short yet informative enough to engage the reader.   >*Press Release Example*       >   >**“SMALL IMAGE OF ALBUM ARTWORK”**   >   >**Unnamed Artist - “Echoes of Heartbreak”**    >   >\short link to stream/DL\   >   >Release Date \Date Placeholder\   >   >**\City, State\** – In an expressive release of emotion, \Artist Name\ presents their latest single ""Song Title"", a narrative on heartbreak and the personal journey towards recovery. This track, born out of an intense five-hour session with collaborator \Collaborator Name\, is not only deeply personal but also resonates with a large audience.   >   >Facing one of their most challenging breakups, \Artist Name\ turned to songwriting for comfort, “I felt completely isolated, and this song became a medium for the emotions I was grappling with.” ""Song Title"" confronts the dichotomy between societal expectations to recover swiftly from a breakup and the reality of enduring heartache.   >   >The single addresses the often silent pressure to heal quickly from heartbreak, contrasting it with the more extended process of true emotional recovery. \Artist Name\ explains, “This song is about the uncomfortable rush society imposes on us to heal.” It extends empathy to those still feeling sad long after a relationship has ended, serving as a reminder that healing is a personal journey.   >   >“Song Title” is not just a single; it is a message that healing takes time and should not be rushed. Through this song, \Artist Name\ connects with those on the arduous path of emotional healing, affirming, “Your feelings are valid and understood.”   >   >Social Links | Media Assets \hyperlinks\   >   >For Inquiries/Press email.com    &x200B;    **Distributing Press Release - 1.5 Months Before Release** Distribution of your press release is where your contact building comes into play. Utilize the relationships you’ve developed with bloggers, journalists, and writers. Since you’ve taken the time to understand their interests and build rapport, tailor your email or message when sending the press release. Highlight aspects of your release that align with their previous work or interests.  Remember that the most impactful connections are those you’ve personally nurtured. These are the individuals who are more likely to give your release the attention it deserves. When you send out the press release, personalize your emails. A personal touch shows that you’re not just sending out a mass email but that you value the recipient's role in the music industry.  The goal of the press release is not just to inform, but to tell your story. It’s about presenting your music in a way that resonates with your audience and provides them with everything they need to write a compelling piece about your work. Timing is also critical. Plan to send out your press release 1.5 months in advance of your release date, giving writers and bloggers enough time to cover your music.  After sending your press release, it's crucial to follow up effectively without being annoying. Begin by giving recipients a week and a half to review your press release. Then, send a follow-up email, reiterating the key points and offering additional information or answers to questions. The key is to be persistent but not pushy, so if there's no response after one or two follow-ups, it's best to move on.  Don’t be that person who comments “Check your DM’s/email” on their socials.   &x200B; **Spotify/DSP Pitch** **- 1 Month Before Release** When making your Spotify pitch, consider it as an alternative version to your press release, but tailored specifically for Spotify’s curators. The pitch should convey the unique elements of your music, extracting key parts of your press release such as the story behind the song, its distinctive features, and any inspirations. This ensures consistency in your messaging and leverages the time/effort you’ve already put into crafting your press release. The inclusion of a marketing plan in your pitch is crucial. This plan should detail how you intend to drive engagement and listeners to Spotify. Highlight any promotional activities, social media campaigns, or content strategies that will draw traffic to your track on the platform. The aim is to show Spotify that you are not only invested in promoting your music but also in contributing to keeping users engaged on their platform. This is why optimizing your profile is so important. The most important aspects of pitching are focusing on clarity and relevance. Ensure your pitch is concise, directly addressing why your track would be a good fit for the playlist you’re targeting. It’s important to be genre-specific and align your music with the curator's tastes and the playlist’s theme. You have a limited amount of words to do this, so be smart.  What to avoid in a pitch is equally important. Do not use generic statements and exaggerations that don't provide specific information about your music. Avoid making unrealistic claims or comparisons that may set expectations too high. The goal is to be authentic and honest, presenting your music in a way that speaks for itself. In summary, a successful Spotify pitch is a blend of insightful information from your press release, a clear and concise explanation of what makes your track unique, and a solid plan for driving engagement on the platform. It’s about showing Spotify not just the quality of your music, but also your proactive approach to attracting and retaining listeners on their platform. When pitching to Spotify's Editorial Playlist, keep your submission concise, limiting it to 500 characters. Ideally, submit your pitch at least 2 weeks before your release date. This timing increases the likelihood of your track also being included in algorithmic playlists like Release Radar & Radio.  When composing your pitch, remember to include the following elements * Always use third-person narration. * Mention the artist's name, their location, and the genres they represent. * Provide details about the track, including insights into the production process, lyrics, sounds, and the emotions it conveys. * Describe your promotion strategy &x200B; >*Example 1*   >   >""'Ava Grayson', a Denver singer-songwriter, and 'Nova Pulse', a Parisian producer, present 'Whispering Pines', a folk-electronica fusion. Ava's vocals and Nova's Moby-like electronic arrangements have intrigued 'Harmony Records', with promotion planned on NPR's All Songs Considered and across US and French music blogs and radio.""   >   >*Example 2*    >   >""'KRONIK', Miami's bass scene star, collaborates with Tokyo's 'Lunar Echoes' on 'Neon Dreams', a vibrant colorbass track blending pulsating beats and Madeon-style electronics. Garnering 'ElectroGroove Records' interest, it's slated for SiriusXM's BPM and various EDM festivals and blogs in the US and Japan."" &x200B; &x200B; **Amazon Pitch - 1 Month Before Release** While many artists focus primarily on Spotify, it's crucial not to forget about Amazon Music. This platform gets less attention from artists, giving you a potential advantage due to the less crowded space. By using your Spotify strategies on Amazon Music, you can tap into a unique audience segment. Ensure your Amazon Music profile is meticulously updated and fully utilized.  This includes leveraging distinctive features like voice intros, which allow you to add a personal touch to your music, and Twitch integrations, catering to the crossover audience between music listeners and gaming communities. Additionally, Amazon Music's less saturated environment compared to Spotify's crowded playlisting space can work in your favor. With fewer artists pitching, your music has a higher chance of standing out and being featured. This approach is not just about diversification; it’s a strategic move to increase visibility where your competition might be lower. Each platform has its audience and quirks, and by not limiting yourself to just one, you increase your chances of reaching a wider, more varied listener base. In the end, while Spotify is undeniably a major player in the music streaming world, leveraging other platforms like Amazon Music can provide you with an edge in a highly competitive market. *^(\*\*Keep in mind that Amazon pitches have a 1000-character limit use it to your advantage to add more details.)*   &x200B;  **Third-Party Playlist Pitching -** **1 Month Before Release** Investigate and submit your music to relevant Spotify playlists. To find curators, check the playlist's description on Spotify for contact info, or use Google to search for the curator's details. You will be using the same strategy used for obtaining writers/bloggers' contact information. When pitching to a Spotify User Playlist, the approach can vary widely, ranging from an email to an Instagram DM, or even more unconventional methods (Submithub, Weird websites, etc.), depending on the curator's preferred submission process. Discover their guidelines by examining their user profile or the playlist's description.  To truly stand out to a user curator, it's crucial to grasp what they're looking for. Do they, have a deep interest in your genre, or are they more financially driven?  Regardless, simplicity is key. Avoid getting bogged down in excessive details. Key Points for Your Pitch * Emphasize simplicity, which is always appreciated. * Maintain a kind and friendly tone. * Clearly state your artist name, location, and genre(s). * Briefly describe your track, including production highlights, its distinctive sounds, and the emotions it evokes. * Outline your promotion strategy. If advantageous, include your follower count and monthly listeners; if not, it's better to omit these details.   >Example   >   >Hey \Playlist Curator's Name\!   >   >I'm a huge fan of your playlist \Playlist Name\. I wanted to reach out to inquire about your submission process. I've recently worked on a new track that I believe would be a fantastic fit for “playlist name”.   >   >The track, titled ""\Insert Song Title\,"" is a bass-heavy track set to release on \Insert Release Date\. This song holds a special place as it represents \briefly describe the story or inspiration behind the song\. \Decribe track further production/sound-wise\, something I feel would resonate well with the vibe of your playlist.   >   >I'm currently promoting this track across various platforms, including \insert marketing strategy here\. I believe it would add a unique flavor to your collection.   >   >I'd be thrilled if you could spare a moment to listen to it. Here's the link \Insert Link Here\.   >   >Looking forward to your thoughts. &x200B;  **Choosing the Right Playlisting Services** **- 1 Month Before Release** ***If your budget is over $500***, When considering playlisting services, prioritize those that are curated by individuals who value genuine selection overpaid, automatic placements. Opt for services that distribute your track to playlist curators, allowing them to choose whether to include your music based on its merit. It's important to remember that this process is discretionary, much like Spotify's, where curators have the final say in adding or not adding your track to their playlists. This approach ensures a more authentic and potentially rewarding placement for your music. Playlisting is a strategy that broadens your reach, but *its true value is realized only when complemented with consistent, quality music releases and targeted advertising for future projects*. It's about not just capturing an audience, but also maintaining their interest and loyalty over time. I highly recommend not doing playlisting if you do not have additional funds to engage the audience afterward.  ***With a budget under $500***, the focus should be on leveraging organic growth and cost-effective strategies. Creating engaging content is key – music videos, behind-the-scenes footage, and interactive social media posts designed to resonate with your audience and encourage shares. This approach helps increase visibility without a heavy reliance on advertising funds. Simultaneously, targeted social media ads can be highly effective. Even small investments in platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok, *when carefully tailored to your target audience* or *placed behind content already performing well organically* can yield significant results. Tapping into existing networks, and collaborating with other artists or fans are cost-efficient ways to expand your reach. Continuously analyze and adapt your strategies based on audience engagement patterns, ensuring that every dollar of your budget is effectively utilized to grow your listener base. &x200B; &x200B;  **Post-Release Promotion** **- Ongoing After Release Until Next Release Cycle**     Post-release, your focus should shift towards content creation and social media engagement to keep the conversation around your track vibrant. Share updates, user-generated content, reviews, and mentions of your music. Engage your audience with varied content like live performance videos, behind-the-scenes glimpses of the creation process, and discussions about the track's meaning.  Remember, the long-term goal is to get picked up by Spotify's algorithm, leading to features in radio stations, discovery playlists, and more. This kind of organic growth can be more valuable than editorial playlisting in the long run, as it signifies a genuine and growing interest in your music. Simultaneously, targeted social media ad campaigns can broaden your reach, drawing in new listeners. Showcasing playlist additions, positive reviews, and fan testimonials can add credibility and pique curiosity, attracting a wider audience. Amid these promotional activities, expressing gratitude plays a crucial role. Thank your fans through various channels, as they are fundamental to your music's success. Consider personal engagement strategies, like live Q&A sessions, thank-you emails, or special content dedicated to fans. This appreciation helps fortify their loyalty and encourages ongoing support. Equally important is acknowledging the playlists, writers, and bloggers who supported your release. Public shoutouts, personalized messages, or mentions in interviews not only show your appreciation but also strengthen your relationships within the music industry. This can pave the way for continued support and coverage for your future releases. In essence, post-release promotion is a balanced mix of maintaining visibility for your track and nurturing the relationships you've built with your audience and industry professionals. By combining ongoing engagement with a heartfelt expression of gratitude, you set a foundation for sustained growth and support in your musical journey.    **Resources**      Adobe Express.

&x200b; **profile optimization - 3 months before release\*** remember, the objective of any platform is to keep listeners engaged with your content. this means not just attracting them to your profile but keeping them there with updated, and interactive content. why would spotify give a half-assed profile the spotlight? why would they playlist someone who doesn't give a shit?  with spotify's focus on providing an experience, fully fleshed-out profiles that utilize *all available features* and showcase your music's uniqueness are more likely to be highlighted and recommended within the platform. optimizing your spotify profile involves several key elements that ensure your presence on the platform is as compelling and engaging as possible. spotify wants to showcase artist using their platform to its fullest potential.  it's essential to keep your profile and cover photos updated regularly, especially with each new release. this visual aspect is crucial as it's often the first impression potential listeners have of your music. your bio is another vital component. it should be more than just a list of achievements or a dry account of your musical history, no one gives a shit. instead, it should tell your story, connecting with listeners and giving them insight into who you are as an artist and what your music represents.  adding a “canvas” to every release is crucial, a well-chosen canvas can complement your song's mood, add to its storytelling, and increase engagement, as visually captivating tracks tend to get more shares and saves. a creative and eye-catching canvas that isn’t cookie-cutter could be just the thing that makes someone stop scrolling and start listening.  doing the amazon ""canvas"" equivalent which is voice intros  when crafting a press release for your single or album, it’s important to capture your project in a way that engages and informs. you don’t want to be using crazy words, be genuine (literally the key to everything) start with an introductory paragraph that hooks the reader – this could be a brief story about the inspiration behind the album, a notable collaboration, or an interesting aspect of the production.  in the body of the press release, provide more detail. this should include background on the making of the album or single, discussion on the lyrics, and any unique features or highlights. if there’s a particular narrative or theme that ties the project together, elaborate on this to give writers and bloggers a deeper understanding of your work. include quotes from yourself or collaborators that provide personal insights into the music.  finish with details such as track listings, availability (platforms where the music will be released), and contact information for further inquiries.  don’t forget to add links to your music, social media profiles, and any relevant multimedia assets like album art or promotional photos.  the length of a press release generally should be about one page, roughly 500-750 words, to ensure it's short yet informative enough to engage the reader.   >*press release example*       >   >**“small image of album artwork”**   >   >**unnamed artist - “echoes of heartbreak”**    >   >\short link to stream/dl\   >   >release date \date placeholder\   >   >**\city, state\** – in an expressive release of emotion, \artist name\ presents their latest single ""song title"", a narrative on heartbreak and the personal journey towards recovery. this track, born out of an intense five-hour session with collaborator \collaborator name\, is not only deeply personal but also resonates with a large audience.   >   >facing one of their most challenging breakups, \artist name\ turned to songwriting for comfort, “i felt completely isolated, and this song became a medium for the emotions i was grappling with.” ""song title"" confronts the dichotomy between societal expectations to recover swiftly from a breakup and the reality of enduring heartache.   >   >the single addresses the often silent pressure to heal quickly from heartbreak, contrasting it with the more extended process of true emotional recovery. \artist name\ explains, “this song is about the uncomfortable rush society imposes on us to heal.” it extends empathy to those still feeling sad long after a relationship has ended, serving as a reminder that healing is a personal journey.   >   >“song title” is not just a single; it is a message that healing takes time and should not be rushed. through this song, \artist name\ connects with those on the arduous path of emotional healing, affirming, “your feelings are valid and understood.”   >   >social links | media assets \hyperlinks\   >   >for inquiries/press email.com    &x200b;    **distributing press release - 1.5 months before release** distribution of your press release is where your contact building comes into play. utilize the relationships you’ve developed with bloggers, journalists, and writers. since you’ve taken the time to understand their interests and build rapport, tailor your email or message when sending the press release. highlight aspects of your release that align with their previous work or interests.  remember that the most impactful connections are those you’ve personally nurtured. these are the individuals who are more likely to give your release the attention it deserves. when you send out the press release, personalize your emails. a personal touch shows that you’re not just sending out a mass email but that you value the recipient's role in the music industry.  the goal of the press release is not just to inform, but to tell your story. it’s about presenting your music in a way that resonates with your audience and provides them with everything they need to write a compelling piece about your work. timing is also critical. plan to send out your press release 1.5 months in advance of your release date, giving writers and bloggers enough time to cover your music.  after sending your press release, it's crucial to follow up effectively without being annoying. begin by giving recipients a week and a half to review your press release. then, send a follow-up email, reiterating the key points and offering additional information or answers to questions. the key is to be persistent but not pushy, so if there's no response after one or two follow-ups, it's best to move on.  don’t be that person who comments “check your dm’s/email” on their socials.   &x200b; **spotify/dsp pitch** **- 1 month before release** when making your spotify pitch, consider it as an alternative version to your press release, but tailored specifically for spotify’s curators. the pitch should convey the unique elements of your music, extracting key parts of your press release such as the story behind the song, its distinctive features, and any inspirations. this ensures consistency in your messaging and leverages the time/effort you’ve already put into crafting your press release. the inclusion of a marketing plan in your pitch is crucial. this plan should detail how you intend to drive engagement and listeners to spotify. highlight any promotional activities, social media campaigns, or content strategies that will draw traffic to your track on the platform. the aim is to show spotify that you are not only invested in promoting your music but also in contributing to keeping users engaged on their platform. this is why optimizing your profile is so important. the most important aspects of pitching are focusing on clarity and relevance. ensure your pitch is concise, directly addressing why your track would be a good fit for the playlist you’re targeting. it’s important to be genre-specific and align your music with the curator's tastes and the playlist’s theme. you have a limited amount of words to do this, so be smart.  what to avoid in a pitch is equally important. do not use generic statements and exaggerations that don't provide specific information about your music. avoid making unrealistic claims or comparisons that may set expectations too high. the goal is to be authentic and honest, presenting your music in a way that speaks for itself. in summary, a successful spotify pitch is a blend of insightful information from your press release, a clear and concise explanation of what makes your track unique, and a solid plan for driving engagement on the platform. it’s about showing spotify not just the quality of your music, but also your proactive approach to attracting and retaining listeners on their platform. when pitching to spotify's editorial playlist, keep your submission concise, limiting it to 500 characters. ideally, submit your pitch at least 2 weeks before your release date. this timing increases the likelihood of your track also being included in algorithmic playlists like release radar & radio.  when composing your pitch, remember to include the following elements * always use third-person narration. * mention the artist's name, their location, and the genres they represent. * provide details about the track, including insights into the production process, lyrics, sounds, and the emotions it conveys. * describe your promotion strategy &x200b; >*example 1*   >   >""'ava grayson', a denver singer-songwriter, and 'nova pulse', a parisian producer, present 'whispering pines', a folk-electronica fusion. ava's vocals and nova's moby-like electronic arrangements have intrigued 'harmony records', with promotion planned on npr's all songs considered and across us and french music blogs and radio.""   >   >*example 2*    >   >""'kronik', miami's bass scene star, collaborates with tokyo's 'lunar echoes' on 'neon dreams', a vibrant colorbass track blending pulsating beats and madeon-style electronics. garnering 'electrogroove records' interest, it's slated for siriusxm's bpm and various edm festivals and blogs in the us and japan."" &x200b; &x200b; **amazon pitch - 1 month before release** while many artists focus primarily on spotify, it's crucial not to forget about amazon music. this platform gets less attention from artists, giving you a potential advantage due to the less crowded space. by using your spotify strategies on amazon music, you can tap into a unique audience segment. ensure your amazon music profile is meticulously updated and fully utilized.  this includes leveraging distinctive features like voice intros, which allow you to add a personal touch to your music, and twitch integrations, catering to the crossover audience between music listeners and gaming communities. additionally, amazon music's less saturated environment compared to spotify's crowded playlisting space can work in your favor. with fewer artists pitching, your music has a higher chance of standing out and being featured. this approach is not just about diversification; it’s a strategic move to increase visibility where your competition might be lower. each platform has its audience and quirks, and by not limiting yourself to just one, you increase your chances of reaching a wider, more varied listener base. in the end, while spotify is undeniably a major player in the music streaming world, leveraging other platforms like amazon music can provide you with an edge in a highly competitive market. *^(\*\*keep in mind that amazon pitches have a 1000-character limit use it to your advantage to add more details.)*   &x200b;  **third-party playlist pitching -** **1 month before release** investigate and submit your music to relevant spotify playlists. to find curators, check the playlist's description on spotify for contact info, or use google to search for the curator's details. you will be using the same strategy used for obtaining writers/bloggers' contact information. when pitching to a spotify user playlist, the approach can vary widely, ranging from an email to an instagram dm, or even more unconventional methods (submithub, weird websites, etc.), depending on the curator's preferred submission process. discover their guidelines by examining their user profile or the playlist's description.  to truly stand out to a user curator, it's crucial to grasp what they're looking for. do they, have a deep interest in your genre, or are they more financially driven?  regardless, simplicity is key. avoid getting bogged down in excessive details. key points for your pitch * emphasize simplicity, which is always appreciated. * maintain a kind and friendly tone. * clearly state your artist name, location, and genre(s). * briefly describe your track, including production highlights, its distinctive sounds, and the emotions it evokes. * outline your promotion strategy. if advantageous, include your follower count and monthly listeners; if not, it's better to omit these details.   >example   >   >hey \playlist curator's name\!   >   >i'm a huge fan of your playlist \playlist name\. i wanted to reach out to inquire about your submission process. i've recently worked on a new track that i believe would be a fantastic fit for “playlist name”.   >   >the track, titled ""\insert song title\,"" is a bass-heavy track set to release on \insert release date\. this song holds a special place as it represents \briefly describe the story or inspiration behind the song\. \decribe track further production/sound-wise\, something i feel would resonate well with the vibe of your playlist.   >   >i'm currently promoting this track across various platforms, including \insert marketing strategy here\. i believe it would add a unique flavor to your collection.   >   >i'd be thrilled if you could spare a moment to listen to it. here's the link \insert link here\.   >   >looking forward to your thoughts. &x200b;  **choosing the right playlisting services** **- 1 month before release** ***if your budget is over $500***, when considering playlisting services, prioritize those that are curated by individuals who value genuine selection overpaid, automatic placements. opt for services that distribute your track to playlist curators, allowing them to choose whether to include your music based on its merit. it's important to remember that this process is discretionary, much like spotify's, where curators have the final say in adding or not adding your track to their playlists. this approach ensures a more authentic and potentially rewarding placement for your music. playlisting is a strategy that broadens your reach, but *its true value is realized only when complemented with consistent, quality music releases and targeted advertising for future projects*. it's about not just capturing an audience, but also maintaining their interest and loyalty over time. i highly recommend not doing playlisting if you do not have additional funds to engage the audience afterward.  ***with a budget under $500***, the focus should be on leveraging organic growth and cost-effective strategies. creating engaging content is key – music videos, behind-the-scenes footage, and interactive social media posts designed to resonate with your audience and encourage shares. this approach helps increase visibility without a heavy reliance on advertising funds. simultaneously, targeted social media ads can be highly effective. even small investments in platforms like facebook, instagram, or tiktok, *when carefully tailored to your target audience* or *placed behind content already performing well organically* can yield significant results. tapping into existing networks, and collaborating with other artists or fans are cost-efficient ways to expand your reach. continuously analyze and adapt your strategies based on audience engagement patterns, ensuring that every dollar of your budget is effectively utilized to grow your listener base. &x200b; &x200b;  **post-release promotion** **- ongoing after release until next release cycle**     post-release, your focus should shift towards content creation and social media engagement to keep the conversation around your track vibrant. share updates, user-generated content, reviews, and mentions of your music. engage your audience with varied content like live performance videos, behind-the-scenes glimpses of the creation process, and discussions about the track's meaning.  remember, the long-term goal is to get picked up by spotify's algorithm, leading to features in radio stations, discovery playlists, and more. this kind of organic growth can be more valuable than editorial playlisting in the long run, as it signifies a genuine and growing interest in your music. simultaneously, targeted social media ad campaigns can broaden your reach, drawing in new listeners. showcasing playlist additions, positive reviews, and fan testimonials can add credibility and pique curiosity, attracting a wider audience. amid these promotional activities, expressing gratitude plays a crucial role. thank your fans through various channels, as they are fundamental to your music's success. consider personal engagement strategies, like live q&a sessions, thank-you emails, or special content dedicated to fans. this appreciation helps fortify their loyalty and encourages ongoing support. equally important is acknowledging the playlists, writers, and bloggers who supported your release. public shoutouts, personalized messages, or mentions in interviews not only show your appreciation but also strengthen your relationships within the music industry. this can pave the way for continued support and coverage for your future releases. in essence, post-release promotion is a balanced mix of maintaining visibility for your track and nurturing the relationships you've built with your audience and industry professionals. by combining ongoing engagement with a heartfelt expression of gratitude, you set a foundation for sustained growth and support in your musical journey.    **resources**      adobe express. this may seem harsh, but the truth is that spotify is giving you access to millions of people who otherwise you would need to hit the streets to acquire. just because you don’t have to pass out mixtapes in 2023, doesn’t mean that you don’t have to put in the work. the platforms dsps offer give you a chance to reach a global audience. this guide won't guarantee you being playlisted but it will greatly improve your chances.     thank you for making it this far, i appreciate you for making me feel like i didn't waste my sunday trying to help others.  if you still need help, i don’t mean “i want someone to do everything for me” help, feel free to reach out.

&amp;#x200B;

To clarify some things, no you don't need to upload music on spotify and you also don't need to invest anything.  
It's a pretty simple method but use it as a base to make your own that fits you the best.  
We will be earning from playlists: you share playlists on spotify, get a lot of listeners and get money just by adding artist's songs on them. Simple.  
You can use chatgpt for this by prompting something like ""make me a playlist with \[genre\] songs with \[characteristics\]"", remember to not add specific stuff because it will most likely recommend random songs that aren't close to those genres...  
Let's say your playlist now has a lot fo listeners, now you need to sign up on a site like submithub which lets you become a curator which you basically get paid to promote songs on your playlist. This part of the method needs to be done as it should so don't accept random songs and pretend your doing your job, that only hurts you and artists.  


**How to promote your playlist?**

  
Make an account on tiktok or instagram, if you know how to edit videos, try making an edit with your playlist songs and clips with an awesome ambient that fit well. Add a text according to that aesthetic like ""How life feels/starts feeling when (put whatever fits better, depends a lot on your song and video)"". If you don't know how to edit, just use capcut templates. They won't work as well but if you know how to market it should be able to attract people. If you need background videos get them from royalty free stock sites like pixabay.  
On every video write captions like ""Playlist link in my bio"", i recommend writing something better but the objective is to let viewers know about your playlist.

I will be releasing an EP this year and I am looking for advice on DIY marketing tactics I may not have thought of. 

I released three singles last year and will be bundling them with two new songs and releasing it as an EP this summer. My main goal is college/community radio play, and secondary goal is streaming numbers. 

WHAT I’VE TRIED SO FAR

Last year I tried SubmitHub and Musosoup for playlisting and media coverage. I pitched  to 56 SubmitHub curators and bloggers (I targeted very carefully) and got 19 approved, leading to a single blog article and maybe 3000+ Spotify streams total. Musosoup I got like 100 offers but they are mostly trash so I paid for maybe 4 different articles from seemingly respectable websites. 

I also tried direct contact (email, IG) with many dozens of playlisters using Indie Bible, but had 0 success. 

I also used Earshot for general college/community radio distribution, combined with a DIY email campaign to around 40 of these stations across Canada. I did what I think was a pretty good job following best practices on these emails (proper subject lines, focused content with all relevant info, links to further press kit resources, etc.). I used an online radio tracking tool for some of the songs, and it seems I’ve gotten maybe close to 80 plays on 9 stations in 6 provinces. 


HOW CAN I IMPROVE?

To me, these results are wildly successful considering where I started (nowhere). But I know that college/community stations prefer albums and EPs to singles, and I am hoping I can improve on these results. So…

What new tactics should I consider when trying to get radio play for the EP, beyond or in conjunction with another email campaign? Keep in mind this is Canadian markets. 

What other tactics might I consider to improve streaming numbers? I like SubmitHub and will probably use it again but I don’t really understand how to get any large streaming numbers out of it…

Doesn’t seem like it should be that tricky. However, everything I’m hearing sounds like it’s dusty, nostalgic, Indy stuff, or 80s sounding stuff, Lofi, study beats, ambient, and then some other stuff that wouldn’t even be remotely close to the kind of stuff I’m doing.

I feel like there should be some thing that works for my music. Doesn’t seem like it’s that out there. Just not finding anything.

But there genuinely just doesn’t seem to be many curators on the site who deal with genre-blending or genre-defying music. At least not that I’ve seen. 

For example, one of my hip-hop artists has a Rage Trap-styled song which intentionally flips the genre on its head by introducing more traditional, positive, punchline-styled vocals over classically “rage” styled instrumentals. The song keeps getting rejected but it doesn’t seem that it’s for the song quality. It seems to be the fact that it doesn’t fit neatly into the existing genre-based playlists. According to the feedback, it’s either bc the vocals are too traditional and “punchline style” for the playlist or it’s because the instrumentals are too new wave, unconventional, and not traditional enough for the playlist. 

So… am I just using submithub wrong? Is there a way to find all the more experimental curators who are less concerned about genre?

18l2z92,1702884216.0,synthwaveproducers,SuperBourguignon,Advices about the Youtube algorythm,"Hey guys, hi. I'd like to have your opinion/advice on a matter:

I started releasing tracks in october, 3 tracks si far, with Distrokid. On Youtube, wierdly, I had listeners pretty quickly at the beginning. The second single worked well (for a beginer). I recently released a 3rd track (which I find is the best so far) and it was not pushed as much by the aglorythm, through the ""impressions"" system and is now stagnating. 

I thought it was because people did not like the song or the visual as much as the 2 previous tracks, so I asked for Hot or Not reviews on submithub and every review is good so far... the track was also accepted on some curator's spotify playlists.

I'm quite lost with what makes a content work or not with Youtube, i'd appreciate your insight if you have experience in the matter... Thanks in advance!

One of my songs got featured on what I thought was a high traffic prominent playlist. I was on the playlist for about a month and got almost 5k plays from it. 

Today I log into my distrokid and that one song got me flagged for botting, it's my first strike ever for something like this. I check my metrics, and the 5k streams I got from the playlist in question had been reduced to 4 plays.

So, needless to say, I'm simply off of the playlisting hustle. It's too difficult to vet whether streams are being inflated on them. It seems like you're faced with two options:  
a. spend an enormous amount of time to get features on playlists that can only get you 10-15 plays tops.  
b. focus on higher traffic playlists, which runs the risk of getting your account flagged.  


Learn from my mistake, don't bother focusing on playlisting anymore. Spotify is cracking down hard on the fake streams, and it will only result in you getting fucked.

18d82ny,1701989676.0,musicmarketing,Kypathos,Would it be a mistake to pass on this deal?,"Hello! 

I'm a *very* small instrumental/lo-fi experimental artist (and by small I mean under 300 followers on everything + double digit avg. streams) but I love what I do and would like to get it to more people. I'm really bad at marketing and have wasted time and money over the years in places like submithub, instagram ads, cold emailing etc. to no avail. Haven't sent to any labels because I'm really not sure my music is at that level yet.

For the past year or so I've just been putting out music with no promotion outside of occasional social posts, and my latest release happened to catch the attention of someone who owns a small record label. The owner contacted me, mentioned he loved my EP, and said he wanted to talk about doing physicals for any upcoming music I have. I don't know what specifically the offer would be, but I'm sure I wouldn't be making any money and it'd be purely for the exposure, which I have no problem with in concept.

The label is really small, but is followed by a couple larger labels. It has less followers than I do (barely over 100), and has released work of artists larger than I am with somewhat of a fanbase. None of them are even remotely close to the type of music I make (they're completely rock/hardcore/pop-rock music), so I feel like any audience they may have would not take interest in my work. *But then again, I have relatively no audience.* 

Is (potentially) the wrong audience better than to just continue what I've been doing, throwing spaghetti at the wall until something sticks?

187kyyj,1701357583.0,poppunkers,ShowerBeersMusic,"RELEASE PLAN: This Is How a Small Pop Punk Band Hit 10,000 Streams On Our New Song","This is a follow-up/crosspost from our initial rundown we posted on our release date over on r/musicmarketing. Updating it here since r/poppunkers is full of similarly sized bands who might find this guide useful, as we did achieve our goal of getting our song on Spotify's Discover Weekly algorithm.

My band [Shower Beers dropped a new song](https://open.spotify.com/track/5adaZ6pRhspVTdIPPTQzeQ?si=fe38853d7c8742a8) 3 weeks ago – during the prep process for HOW we’d promote, I utilized a ton of random reddit threads along with what I already knew about the music marketing process. I compiled EVERYTHING we did in this (long) post with the hopes it might help someone down the line. I’ve also included cost breakdowns where appropriate (I’m not giving rates to our partners that aren’t publicly advertising pricing cause I think that’s rude). Gonna preface that I don’t really have any idea what I’m doing, so who knows what’s good advice and what isn’t here. But we did hit 10k in 3 weeks and triggered Spotify’s Discover Weekly algorithm with our new song, so something worked. Buckle up.

BACKGROUND: we’re a very independent pop punk band. This means a few things:

1. We have a somewhat niche genre and audience target. This is important, as it allows us to dig in deeper with our research and community than if we were a standard pop, rap, EDM, or even country artist. Some of the below that works for us won’t work for more saturated genres.

2. We don’t have the financial backing or professional connections a label would provide, so all marketing is either DIY or out of our own pockets. Also no manager/mentor, so really winging it and seeing what sticks.

3. Because we make rock music, it takes a bit longer to write and record songs compared to a pop singer or rapper who *could* just hop on a beat via any number of producers (not saying everyone does this, but it's easier to do if you wanted to). So the “release a song every week” advice is a bit tougher for a band to do. On that note, you gotta make a bigger deal when you DO drop music since it’s less frequent.

4. Streaming metrics don’t have to be important to you, but I like to set a goal for myself of about ***10,000 streams in the first 21 days of release***. The reason being studies show this is about the amount of listeners you need to get a Spotify Popularity Score of \~30%, which happens to be the threshold needed to trigger Spotify’s Discover Weekly algorithmic placements (we [use musicstax](https://musicstax.com/) to track this). This helps us because Spotify will then actively serve our music in front of potential new fans within our genre – the hope being this snowballs into more active listeners who wanna check out our songs. That's always a nice thing for a band (like I mentioned above, we did achieve this for our new song hence this post update, so mission accomplished I guess).

RECORDING PROCESS

This is where a successful marketing campaign must start. If your song sucks from a songwriting/production standpoint, it SHOULDN’T matter how much you advertise. Unless you’re a plant or marketing genius, it’s prob not going to work out.

We found a studio that’s worked with professional artists in our genre ([Audio Pilot Studios](https://www.audiopilotproduction.com/) in NJ). For a 4 song EP, I wrote around 20 songs, demoed 14, and settled on 4. This is important because we’re not walking into the studio “waiting for inspiration strike” or “seeing how the energy goes.” It is very chill if you have enough capital to spend time writing in-studio. Studios are creative spaces and I’m sure that’s an awesome experience. But since we’re bankrolling the session ourselves, I always want to walk in with the songs as close to complete as possible. Obviously working with a producer means certain changes will happen in the moment (and be prepared to be open to those), but you don’t want to waste time on layups like melodies, lyrics, strumming patterns, who plays what, etc. Caveating this doesn’t mean much if you truly can self-produce a record at a high-quality level. We unfortunately can’t do that LOL.

Once tracking and mixing was complete, we shot the EP off to our mastering house at [Rogue Planet Mastering](https://www.rogueplanetmastering.com/). I’m a big believer in a real mastering engineer being able to take your track from 90% to 100% - it gets you that much closer to a high quality record.

I’m not going to break out all of the costs for the recording process, but all-in-all a 4 song EP from start to finish ran us \~$3,500. These costs can balloon quickly if you’re not efficient.

COLLABORATION

I am a huge fan of partnering with artists on tracks. It’s more important now than ever for a few reasons.

1. It gives me a chance to hang and chat with artists I like

2. It brings new (and better?) voices onto the tracks, which provides more texture

3. It helps other artists as they get a fully-produced track to hop on – this is free high quality content creation without any cost beyond slightly associating themselves with us.

4. It alerts fanbases AND streaming algorithms who is part of which scene. This helps serve your songs to your target community with more accuracy.

5. It gives you a partner when marketing the track (features aren’t *required* to promote, but most will help introduce you to their followers/fans so long as you aren’t a dick)

Overall, if a collab is a fit, it’s a real win-win for everyone involved. We found a feature for every track on this EP through different means. Some were via introductions from folks we’ve met in the music industry. Some were cold-calls via Instagram. And others were found right here on reddit in r/popunkers. Only one feature requested payment (everyone else was open to the exposure/free content), so we spent $300 in total from a feature standpoint. 

PRERELEASE PREP

We pitched our first single “One More Shot” to Spotify a bit over a month in advance of our release date. At the very least, folks recommend pitching 4 weeks ahead of your release date so metadata can be ingested into Spotify and internal playlist curators can review the track for placement. The song as of now hasn’t been added to an editorial playlist, but see below for our playlist pitch:

*NYC's Shower Beers recruit Sydney AU heavyweights SoSo for an intl. pop punk riff-fest. Monster gang-vocal chorus (0:50) gives way to mile-a-minute verse (1:18) that jumps from easycore to ska with total abandon (+ a The Sopranos sample for fun). Prod. by Hidden In Plain View's Rob Freeman (Cobra Starship/Gym Class Heroes) &amp; mastered by Grammy-nominated Mike Kalajian, would fit on Pop Punk's Not Dead or Skatepark Punks. Promo includes a press/ad campaign via Don't Blink Mgmt + a full featured EP*

We hit multiple points here in 500 characters: the areas we’re BOTH from, that the track is a collab, our genre is pop punk, timestamps on relevant high points in the track for review, a few stylistic points to raise intrigue, namedropping who produced/mastered the track + their previous work to establish credibility, what specific playlists we’d like to be on, and how we’re promoting the track (and by so doing promote Spotify). You want your pitch to quickly explain who you are, why the track is worth listening to, and where you belong. Take as much guesswork away from a curator – they listen to so much music they don’t have more than a few seconds to give you. Amazon Music also allows you to pitch songs prerelease – we used much of the same as above although they will allow you more characters.

Now that the track was pitched, we had about 5 weeks to prepare for how we were going to promote this. Below are what we felt were the tools at our disposal:

· Social Media Content (IG/TikTok for the most part, followed by Reddit/Threads/Twitter/Youtube)

· Instagram Ads

· Publisher/Blog Outreach

· Radio Outreach

· User-Generated Playlist Pitching

· Podcast Outreach

· Email Marketing

PR

I partnered with [Don’t Blink Management](https://www.dontblinkmg.com/) so we could utilize their established connections to gain a foothold with more popular publishers. I won’t give DBM’s specific rates. But we reached out to about 5 PR agencies and the average quoted cost was around $300-$600 for an independent band’s PR. Between the two of us, we ended up contacting around the below:

  

|Media Type|Emails Sent|Approvals|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Publisher/Blog|163|18|
|Radio|160|6|
|Podcast|20|3|
|Social Influencers|19|3|

So yeah, it’s a lot of work for a \~8% hit rate. Folks will debate the benefit of PR and Radio in today’s music landscape, but pretty much I think it’s fun to see stuff get published or aired about our band. And end of the day, you do music because it’s fun, so I think it’s worth it.

I’m not going to give every PR template I have (you’ll change your message based on publisher/radio/podcasts), but below is what we wrote in regards to publishers (with relevant links removed):

*SUBJECT: PR 11/9 Release: NYC Pop Punk Band Shower Beers Big-Riff Single*

*TL:DR - Shower Beers is dropping ""One More Shot"" (the debut single off our new EP featuring Australian heavyweights SoSo) on 11/9 and hope \[PUBNAME\] would be interested in covering the track.* 

*Hi \[NAME\],*

*I'm \[YOURNAME\] from the NYC-based pop punk band Shower Beers. I'm reaching out as I noticed you've covered some pop-punk acts in the past \[EXAMPLE HERE\] - we were hoping \[NAME\] would consider covering our new single ""One More Shot"" on or after our November 9th release.*

*Streaming and download available at the private Soundcloud link below:*

*PREVIEWLINK*

*Produced at Audio Pilot Studios by Rob Freeman (Gym Class Heroes, Cobra Starship, Hidden In Plain View), ""One More Shot"" is the debut single off our 2nd EP ""Miracle on 34th &amp; 3rd."" We teamed up with the saucy lads in SoSo from Sydney, Australia to create what we feel is an international smash. Idobi Radio once referred to our music as ""an uppercut with brass knuckles"" - we hope \[NAME\] will agree.*

*Feel free to reach out to me at this email if you have questions or need any more information. I've included our official press release via Don't Blink Management HERE and our EPK HERE.*

*Thank you for your consideration!*

The subject line clearly defines what the email is about (calling out location and genre). I add a TL:DR at the top so editors don’t have to read too much before determining if this request is in their wheelhouse (you should only be reaching out to folks in your genre regardless). I try to be personal by finding editor names if I can and providing mine. I’m NOT attaching MP3 files but using streaming/download links – it’s rude to fill someone’s inbox storage with files. Again, I’m providing credibility with our producer’s namedrop AND a link to a previous article written about us by a publisher in the scene (Idobi Radio). I end with our Press Release and EPK so editors should have everything needed to produce content.

The easiest way to find publishers is to be knowledgeable in your community. I read a good amount of the sites I reach out to. But in some cases, the 2nd easiest thing to do is Google artists that are a bit more popular than you are and see who is writing about them. This way you’ll quickly put together a PR database in your genre.

With Radio, it was much of the same as above. First I listed all radio stations in our genre I knew of. Then, I googled our genres + radio (pop punk radio, punk rock radio, easycore radio, etc). Once I scraped those, I used Spotify analytics to find out which countries were listening to pop punk artists the most. For example, Germany and Indonesia are in our top 5 countries, so I made sure to spend extra time researching German and Indonesian rock stations. Then, I checked tour schedules for pop punk artists and found what US states indexed highest amongst the genre. After I had that list, I looked for the top rock-leaning COLLEGE radio stations in those states. Most collegiate stations will have program grids that list what songs/genres they’ve previously played. Spending a few minutes looking for names that match your genre can help you identify who you want to reach out to and who you can skip. 

A note on radio outreach: you’ll want to use Google Drive or Dropbox to host files since most stations will want larger .WAV masters. You’ll ALSO need to include a clean version of your track, specifically with College Radios who try to remain FCC compliant. If you don’t produce your own music, you can easily use Reaper or another DAW to quickly edit curse words out (I’ll use a tape stop on bad words for example). 

For Social Influencers, our PR Agency had a roster they like to work with. On our end, I just reach out to my pals that have some pull and let them know we dropped a track. Whether they promote that or not is on their own accord. If there is an influencer I really want to hear our track, I’ll DM them and then comment on a recent post to check their DMs. It’s a lil intrusive but part of the game so I don’t think anyone gets too annoyed so long as you’re nice.

With Podcasts, I’ll only reach out to shows I’ve listened to before. That way I understand how to prep for the convo and have background on the hosts. 

An underappreciated aspect of going through the PR process is that at the very least, you’ll be introducing your brand and content to folks who are considered tastemakers. So while our first go here might not yield too much success, our name should become more familiar to influencers in the scene which hopefully can compound down the line. 

SOCIAL CONTENT

From a social media standpoint, I’m good enough with [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) and [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/) to edit together stupid social content. Both systems are free and can be learned via some time on Youtube. As of writing this, I’ve made 50 pieces of SFV content that can be posted to support the track. I’ll probably end up with 60-70 posts. On Instagram I focus on more comedic/skit content using our music. TikTok is more engineered for spamming discoverable content, so I’ll focus on clips like lyric videos. This is personal, but I don’t like the cute TikToks of singing to a camera or whatever. I just don’t wanna do it. That probably hurts us, but I work hard to put out different content that I HOPE differentiates a bit from the thousands of musicians on social media filming in their backyards or bedrooms. I’m probably wrong here, but it is what it is, I don’t wanna lipsync in the bathroom.

I’ll also use social media to stay in contact with other artists/individuals I like in the scene. Give your pals engagement on socials, it only helps their posts. 

On TikTok in particular, I’ll look at what similar artists who are having success are using as captions, hashtags, and on-screen text. The way I look at it is you use hashtags to inform the algorithm who to start serving to at first (fans of your micro-genre), on-screen text relevant to your brand that preps the viewer to watch your video, and a caption to engage them to comment. I’m admittedly not great at this but try to keep it in mind.

PLAYLIST PITCHING

Playlist pitching is a double-edged sword. If you’re in a specific genre like we are (pop punk), it’s a bit easier to find relevant playlists. If you’re in a broad genre like pop or rap, you’re going to have a really hard time getting playlist success without paying/getting botted. Just how it seems to be.

For us, we used 5 tools for our playlist database: Submithub, Groover, Dailyplaylists, Playlistsupply, and Spotify’s “Discovered On” section.

[Submithub](https://www.submithub.com/) works for us because they have a lot of pop-punk specific playlists curated by individuals who like our band. For this song, we used 77 credits (\~$65) to pitch to 25 playlists, of which 7 approved. Those 7 playlists resulted in an additional \~700 streams thus far.

[Groover](https://www.reddit.com/r/poppunkers/groover.co/en) I’ve never used before but saw u/MakePopMusic say he liked it. They didn’t have very many pop-punk specific playlists, but we ended up spending \~$20 to pitch to 6 playlists, of which 3 shared our song. That resulted in an additional \~250 streams thus far.

[Dailyplaylist](https://www.reddit.com/r/poppunkers/dailyplaylists.com) is free which I love (we also curate a playlist here). I’ve seen a minor streaming jump on some playlists, nothing crazy though. At the very least with 20 free submissions a week. So far only 3 playlists have accepted us and the lift has been minimal, but that’s what we expect with free submissions.

[Playlistsupply](https://playlistsupply.com/) is a scraper for Spotify data. It will return playlist follower size and relevant contact info if available like email or social. I’ll start by searching our genre (Pop Punk, Punk, Emo, Alternative, Indie Rock, Rock, Metal, Metalcore, Easycore, Breakdown, etc), then larger similar artists (blink-182, Sum 41, Simple Plan, Beartooth, State Champs, etc), then MOODS (workout, drinking, party, pregame, lifting, racing, etc). All said and done, I sent emails to 90 contacts day-of release with a pitch. Playlistsupply is $20 a month and I cancel the first month after collecting emails. Unfortunately every playlist I found via playlistsupply asked for money (over $10 in most cases) to be placed on questionable playlists, so I won’t be using the service again for pop punk. 

Lastly, I’ll email influencers and other social media movers who run playlists/playlists I find from other artists “Discovered On” section on Spotify. I sent about 25 extra emails this way and so far it’s resulted in an extra \~45 streams.

Altogether our playlisting efforts took $105 for about \~20 extra playlist additions resulting in \~1,050 extra streams after 3 weeks. I think Submithub is the best for poppunk, Groover is fine to supplement, and Dailyplaylist is a ""nice to have."" I don't think Playlistsupply is worth it as of now.

EMAIL MARKETING

We can be better at this. We only collect emails via Distrokid’s “presave” function and I feel like the presave wave is dead at this point. Fans are too tired to click a link every time we drop a song and allow some third party access to their Spotify, so we stopped pushing that. Instead we just are asking our followers on Instagram to follow us on Spotify too. All this to say email is not really a tool we use much yet, but a lot of more established artists do. I didn’t send an email for this track, but folks should consider email.

INSTAGRAM ADS

Our strategy is very specific here. I’ll only buy Instagram story ads (no Facebook ads due to high bot traffic, no IG reels because I just don’t like them). From here, I’ll make 3-4 pieces of very colorful, engaging creative with lyrics from different hooks in our song with a message to “swipe up for Spotify.” You can probably find an example on our socials of one of the lyric videos that’ll look a bit like the ad we use.

From a targeting standpoint, I’ll run 3 separate ad set tiers based on cities. Tier 1 “cities” are just the US, UK, and Australia. Tier 2 cities are music hotspots in pop-punk/our Spotify analytics. This will include Canadian, Brazilian, Mexican, German, and Italian cities plus whatever other cities are jumping out in our song-specific analytics. Lastly I’ll run Tier 3 cities solely to metros in Indonesia and the Philippines. These countries have the lowest CPMs of most other cities I want to run in with a HUGE amount of interest in rock music. I’ll actually allocate a large % of our daily spend to Indonesia and the Philippines because they’re awesome and I would love to tour there LOL. 

Once geo is set, I’ll age-target to 18-44 or 49 (depending on the audience size). We’ll also “interest target” with an “AND” statement. One portion of the target will just be “Spotify”, while the other will be bands, genres, and events we’re similar to (All Time Low, Pop Punk, Warped Tour, etc). This tells Meta to find fans who use Spotify AND ALSO are fans of our genre. Folks like Andrew Southward will preach fine-tuning this strategy by using A/B testing on specific interest targets and utilizing conversion pixels vs simply optimizing to clickthrough. I get that, but I’m just a man. Eventually we’ll optimize this process but for now the easy way is working for us. I’ll allocate about $4 a day for a month – currently trying $2 to Tier 1, $2 to Tier 3, and $1 to Tier 2.

So far we’ve spent $95 for \~650 link clicks against \~100k impressions, which is about $0.15 per click (which is what we expect). Per our geo reporting in FB Ad Manager and Spotify for Artists, it does seem to correlate a bit, but we can be better here by utilizing conversion vs our simple clickthrough ad goal. 

DAY OF RELEASE

About 24-48 hours before launch, I’ll follow up with everyone who agreed to cover our song to see if they need anything else. I’ll also start teasing a track on social 7 days in advance of the release date and ask folks to follow us on Spotify. Week of, I’ll try to drop a small teaser a day – not enough to ruin the surprise but enough to stay engaged. The day prior to dropping I’ll most likely share a piece of content with the chorus/hook. So if we’re dropping a track Thursday, on Monday I’ll post a clip with some ambient filters on the song, Tuesday I’ll highlight a riff, and Wednesday we’ll show the chorus before a midnight Thursday drop.

I take day-of releasing pretty seriously – I think time is of the essence if you want to get algorithms to notice your new content. So I’ll snag a few Red Bulls, try to nap a bit when I get home from work, and be awake and ready to rock for the midnight drop. Once the song is live, the below is exactly what I’ll do into the early morning:

1. I’ll immediately post on my STORY about the song dropping

2. I’ll set our Instagram ads live (as we need the Spotify link for a clickthrough before publishing ads on that platform)

3. I’ll send an email blast to our presave email list asking them to listen and share the song on socials. Easy message, keep it light.

4. I’ll update all our websites – our link in bio, upload a visualizer to our YouTube channel, upload files to Soundcloud and Bandcamp, submit the track to Pandora Amp’d, etc.

5. I’ll playlist pitch to Submithub, then Dailyplaylist, then Groover

6. I’ll submit the track to be ingested by [Musixmatch](https://www.musixmatch.com/) so our lyrics can be tracked on socials/in Spotify

7. I’ll add our lyrics to [Genius](https://genius.com/)

8. I’ll email all the user-generated playlist emails I scrapped from Spotify/PlaylistSupply with a pitch

9. I’ll begin following up with every publisher/radio station/podcast over email with the Spotify link letting them know our song is out and seeing if they were still interested in covering the release

10. From here it’s probably 3AM so I’ll climb into bed and pass out

11. I’ll try to be up at 9AM so I can post our Youtube Visualizer to appropriate Reddit communities

12. I’ll post a release announcement to TikTok at this time as well

13. Instagram, Twitter, and Threads I’ll wait until about 10AM to post on main

14. I’m also part of a few Facebook Groups – I typically never post on Facebook but might give it a shot this time around

15. I’ve also put together some funny flyers I’ll hang up around NYC just for shits and giggles

From there, I’m slogging through a content push over our socials for the next few weeks until it’s time to do it all over again with the next track (since we’re pop punk, we’ll most likely wait until Feb/away from the holidays). I’ll also use this downtime to start tracking demos for our next EP since being in the music cycle is a never-ending hamster wheel that forces you to continuously move until you fall off or die. 

TOTAL COST

If we’re estimating/fudging costs from start to finish, I’m spending about:

  

|Creating the EP|$3,500|
|:-|:-|
|Features|$300|
|PR|$400|
|Playlists|$105|
|Ads|$100|
|TOTAL|$4,405|

IS IT WORTH IT?

Our band has over 100k streams total after existing for a year, with our top track at 38k streams. We peaked at 10k monthly listeners back when we dropped our acoustic track in May but average around 2k monthlies when not releasing music. We’re at 7k monthlies right now, and our song has been in the Discover Weekly algorithm for just over a week. So is dropping \~$4,400 on recording an EP and promoting a single to an audience this size worth it? End of the day, we created something cool and it was heard by others (and sometimes even enjoyed). A few times I’ve met strangers in public at shows and they mentioned how much they liked Shower Beers. It continuously provides me with a sense of purpose and fulfillment. So yeah, while it’s a bit pricey, I think it’s worth it.

Now if someone wanted to do music for a career, this whole scenario becomes a lot more stressful. This is a ton of work for very little monetary upside.

WHAT CAN WE DO BETTER?

I know a few areas I’ve self-critiqued if I wanted to get better at this whole thing:

· We don’t really play too many shows yet (it’s a lot of money and logistics to tour). We’re looking to start opening for folks in the NYC area to get started

· I should accept my fate and start producing more personalized social content (get in front of the camera and dance my little dance)

· I can spend more times in niche social platforms like Discords, Twitch Streams, and YT Shorts

· I can learn/operate Instagram advertising more efficiently via conversion pixels and A/B testing

· We should start selling merch for additional income and roll that shop into email collection

· Spend time creating and managing a vehicle for more organic content (whether that be managing my own music blog, starting a podcast, etc)

If we’re being honest, I’m probably not going to try any of the above anytime soon (outside of playling live) because our current promotion efforts take so much time away from what I really enjoy, which is writing and recording music. But I do find fulfillment in being heard, so this all does feel a bit necessary.

Hopefully this 8 page rundown helps a musician in the future plan for their release. Being a successful musician today is pretty much an exercise in being a full-time brand manager. To summarize, you’ve gotta ensure your music is professional in all aspects, take the pitching process seriously, learn advertising, PR, and content creation, and try to remember that music is fun.

Updating it here since r/poppunkers is full of similarly sized bands who might find this guide useful, as we did achieve our goal of getting our song on Spotify's Discover Weekly algorithm. My band Shower Beers dropped a new song post with the hopes it might help someone down the line. I’ve also included cost breakdowns where appropriate (I’m not giving rates to our partners that aren’t publicly advertising pricing cause I think that’s rude). Gonna preface that I don’t really have any idea what I’m doing, so who knows what’s good advice and what isn’t here. But we did hit 10k in 3 weeks and triggered Spotify’s Discover Weekly algorithm with our new song, so something worked. Buckle up. BACKGROUND we’re a very independent pop punk band. This means a few things 1. We have a somewhat niche genre and audience target. This is important, as it allows us to dig in deeper with our research and community than if we were a standard pop, rap, EDM, or even country artist. Some of the below that works for us won’t work for more saturated genres. 2. We don’t have the financial backing or professional connections a label would provide, so all marketing is either DIY or out of our own pockets. Also no manager/mentor, so really winging it and seeing what sticks. 3. Because we make rock music, it takes a bit longer to write and record songs compared to a pop singer or rapper who *could* just hop on a beat via any number of producers (not saying everyone does this, but it's easier to do if you wanted to). So the “release a song every week” advice is a bit tougher for a band to do. On that note, you gotta make a bigger deal when you DO drop music since it’s less frequent. 4. Streaming metrics don’t have to be important to you, but I like to set a goal for myself of about ***10,000 streams in the first 21 days of release***. The reason being studies show this is about the amount of listeners you need to get a Spotify Popularity Score of \~30%, which happens to be the threshold needed to trigger Spotify’s Discover Weekly algorithmic placements (we use musicstax. This helps us because Spotify will then actively serve our music in front of potential new fans within our genre – the hope being this snowballs into more active listeners who wanna check out our songs. That's always a nice thing for a band (like I mentioned above, we did achieve this for our new song hence this post update, so mission accomplished I guess). RECORDING PROCESS This is where a successful marketing campaign must start. If your song sucks from a songwriting/production standpoint, it SHOULDN’T matter how much you advertise. Unless you’re a plant or marketing genius, it’s prob not going to work out. We found a studio that’s worked with professional artists in our genre (Audio Pilot Studios. For a 4 song EP, I wrote around 20 songs, demoed 14, and settled on 4. This is important because we’re not walking into the studio “waiting for inspiration strike” or “seeing how the energy goes.” It is very chill if you have enough capital to spend time writing in-studio. Studios are creative spaces and I’m sure that’s an awesome experience. But since we’re bankrolling the session ourselves, I always want to walk in with the songs as close to complete as possible. Obviously working with a producer means certain changes will happen in the moment (and be prepared to be open to those), but you don’t want to waste time on layups like melodies, lyrics, strumming patterns, who plays what, etc. Caveating this doesn’t mean much if you truly can self-produce a record at a high-quality level. We unfortunately can’t do that LOL. Once tracking and mixing was complete, we shot the EP off to our mastering house at Rogue Planet Mastering voices onto the tracks, which provides more texture 3. It helps other artists as they get a fully-produced track to hop on – this is free high quality content creation without any cost beyond slightly associating themselves with us. 4. It alerts fanbases AND streaming algorithms who is part of which scene. This helps serve your songs to your target community with more accuracy. 5. It gives you a partner when marketing the track (features aren’t *required* to promote, but most will help introduce you to their followers/fans so long as you aren’t a dick) Overall, if a collab is a fit, it’s a real win-win for everyone involved. We found a feature for every track on this EP through different means. Some were via introductions from folks we’ve met in the music industry. Some were cold-calls via Instagram. And others were found right here on reddit in r/popunkers. Only one feature requested payment (everyone else was open to the exposure/free content), so we spent $300 in total from a feature standpoint.  PRERELEASE PREP We pitched our first single “One More Shot” to Spotify a bit over a month in advance of our release date. At the very least, folks recommend pitching 4 weeks ahead of your release date so metadata can be ingested into Spotify and internal playlist curators can review the track for placement. The song as of now hasn’t been added to an editorial playlist, but see below for our playlist pitch *NYC's Shower Beers recruit Sydney AU heavyweights SoSo for an intl. pop punk riff-fest. Monster gang-vocal chorus (050) gives way to mile-a-minute verse (118) that jumps from easycore to ska with total abandon ( a The Sopranos sample for fun). Prod. by Hidden In Plain View's Rob Freeman (Cobra Starship/Gym Class Heroes) & mastered by Grammy-nominated Mike Kalajian, would fit on Pop Punk's Not Dead or Skatepark Punks. Promo includes a press/ad campaign via Don't Blink Mgmt  a full featured EP* We hit multiple points here in 500 characters the areas we’re BOTH from, that the track is a collab, our genre is pop punk, timestamps on relevant high points in the track for review, a few stylistic points to raise intrigue, namedropping who produced/mastered the track  their previous work to establish credibility, what specific playlists we’d like to be on, and how we’re promoting the track (and by so doing promote Spotify). You want your pitch to quickly explain who you are, why the track is worth listening to, and where you belong. Take as much guesswork away from a curator – they listen to so much music they don’t have more than a few seconds to give you. Amazon Music also allows you to pitch songs prerelease – we used much of the same as above although they will allow you more characters. Now that the track was pitched, we had about 5 weeks to prepare for how we were going to promote this. Below are what we felt were the tools at our disposal · Social Media Content (IG/TikTok for the most part, followed by Reddit/Threads/Twitter/Youtube) · Instagram Ads · Publisher/Blog Outreach · Radio Outreach · User-Generated Playlist Pitching · Podcast Outreach · Email Marketing PR I partnered with Don’t Blink Management, but below is what we wrote in regards to publishers (with relevant links removed) *SUBJECT PR 11/9 Release NYC Pop Punk Band Shower Beers Big-Riff Single* *TLDR - Shower Beers is dropping ""One More Shot"" (the debut single off our new EP featuring Australian heavyweights SoSo) on 11/9 and hope \PUBNAME\ would be interested in covering the track.*  *Hi \NAME\,* *I'm \YOURNAME\ from the NYC-based pop punk band Shower Beers. I'm reaching out as I noticed you've covered some pop-punk acts in the past \EXAMPLE HERE\ - we were hoping \NAME\ would consider covering our new single ""One More Shot"" on or after our November 9th release.* *Streaming and download available at the private Soundcloud link below* *PREVIEWLINK* *Produced at Audio Pilot Studios by Rob Freeman (Gym Class Heroes, Cobra Starship, Hidden In Plain View), ""One More Shot"" is the debut single off our 2nd EP ""Miracle on 34th & 3rd."" We teamed up with the saucy lads in SoSo from Sydney, Australia to create what we feel is an international smash. Idobi Radio once referred to our music as ""an uppercut with brass knuckles"" - we hope \NAME\ will agree.* *Feel free to reach out to me at this email if you have questions or need any more information. I've included our official press release via Don't Blink Management HERE and our EPK HERE.* *Thank you for your consideration!* The subject line clearly defines what the email is about (calling out location and genre). I add a TLDR at the top so editors don’t have to read too much before determining if this request is in their wheelhouse (you should only be reaching out to folks in your genre regardless). I try to be personal by finding editor names if I can and providing mine. I’m NOT attaching MP3 files but using streaming/download links – it’s rude to fill someone’s inbox storage with files. Again, I’m providing credibility with our producer’s namedrop AND a link to a previous article written about us by a publisher in the scene (Idobi Radio). I end with our Press Release and EPK so editors should have everything needed to produce content. The easiest way to find publishers is to be knowledgeable in your community. I read a good amount of the sites I reach out to. But in some cases, the 2nd easiest thing to do is Google artists that are a bit more popular than you are and see who is writing about them. This way you’ll quickly put together a PR database in your genre. With Radio, it was much of the same as above. First I listed all radio stations in our genre I knew of. Then, I googled our genres  radio (pop punk radio, punk rock radio, easycore radio, etc). Once I scraped those, I used Spotify analytics to find out which countries were listening to pop punk artists the most. For example, Germany and Indonesia are in our top 5 countries, so I made sure to spend extra time researching German and Indonesian rock stations. Then, I checked tour schedules for pop punk artists and found what US states indexed highest amongst the genre. After I had that list, I looked for the top rock-leaning COLLEGE radio stations in those states. Most collegiate stations will have program grids that list what songs/genres they’ve previously played. Spending a few minutes looking for names that match your genre can help you identify who you want to reach out to and who you can skip.  A note on radio outreach you’ll want to use Google Drive or Dropbox to host files since most stations will want larger .WAV masters. You’ll ALSO need to include a clean version of your track, specifically with College Radios who try to remain FCC compliant. If you don’t produce your own music, you can easily use Reaper or another DAW to quickly edit curse words out (I’ll use a tape stop on bad words for example).  For Social Influencers, our PR Agency had a roster they like to work with. On our end, I just reach out to my pals that have some pull and let them know we dropped a track. Whether they promote that or not is on their own accord. If there is an influencer I really want to hear our track, I’ll DM them and then comment on a recent post to check their DMs. It’s a lil intrusive but part of the game so I don’t think anyone gets too annoyed so long as you’re nice. With Podcasts, I’ll only reach out to shows I’ve listened to before. That way I understand how to prep for the convo and have background on the hosts.  An underappreciated aspect of going through the PR process is that at the very least, you’ll be introducing your brand and content to folks who are considered tastemakers. So while our first go here might not yield too much success, our name should become more familiar to influencers in the scene which hopefully can compound down the line.  SOCIAL CONTENT From a social media standpoint, I’m good enough with DaVinci Resolve, on-screen text relevant to your brand that preps the viewer to watch your video, and a caption to engage them to comment. I’m admittedly not great at this but try to keep it in mind. PLAYLIST PITCHING Playlist pitching is a double-edged sword. If you’re in a specific genre like we are (pop punk), it’s a bit easier to find relevant playlists. If you’re in a broad genre like pop or rap, you’re going to have a really hard time getting playlist success without paying/getting botted. Just how it seems to be. For us, we used 5 tools for our playlist database Submithub, Groover, Dailyplaylists, Playlistsupply, and Spotify’s “Discovered On” section. Submithub to pitch to 25 playlists, of which 7 approved. Those 7 playlists resulted in an additional \~700 streams thus far. Groover. I’ve seen a minor streaming jump on some playlists, nothing crazy though. At the very least with 20 free submissions a week. So far only 3 playlists have accepted us and the lift has been minimal, but that’s what we expect with free submissions. Playlistsupply, then larger similar artists (blink-182, Sum 41, Simple Plan, Beartooth, State Champs, etc), then MOODS (workout, drinking, party, pregame, lifting, racing, etc). All said and done, I sent emails to 90 contacts day-of release with a pitch. Playlistsupply is $20 a month and I cancel the first month after collecting emails. Unfortunately every playlist I found via playlistsupply asked for money (over $10 in most cases) to be placed on questionable playlists, so I won’t be using the service again for pop punk.  Lastly, I’ll email influencers and other social media movers who run playlists/playlists I find from other artists “Discovered On” section on Spotify. I sent about 25 extra emails this way and so far it’s resulted in an extra \~45 streams. Altogether our playlisting efforts took $105 for about \~20 extra playlist additions resulting in \~1,050 extra streams after 3 weeks. I think Submithub is the best for poppunk, Groover is fine to supplement, and Dailyplaylist is a ""nice to have."" I don't think Playlistsupply is worth it as of now. EMAIL MARKETING We can be better at this. We only collect emails via Distrokid’s “presave” function and I feel like the presave wave is dead at this point. Fans are too tired to click a link every time we drop a song and allow some third party access to their Spotify, so we stopped pushing that. Instead we just are asking our followers on Instagram to follow us on Spotify too. All this to say email is not really a tool we use much yet, but a lot of more established artists do. I didn’t send an email for this track, but folks should consider email. INSTAGRAM ADS Our strategy is very specific here. I’ll only buy Instagram story ads (no Facebook ads due to high bot traffic, no IG reels because I just don’t like them). From here, I’ll make 3-4 pieces of very colorful, engaging creative with lyrics from different hooks in our song with a message to “swipe up for Spotify.” You can probably find an example on our socials of one of the lyric videos that’ll look a bit like the ad we use. From a targeting standpoint, I’ll run 3 separate ad set tiers based on cities. Tier 1 “cities” are just the US, UK, and Australia. Tier 2 cities are music hotspots in pop-punk/our Spotify analytics. This will include Canadian, Brazilian, Mexican, German, and Italian cities plus whatever other cities are jumping out in our song-specific analytics. Lastly I’ll run Tier 3 cities solely to metros in Indonesia and the Philippines. These countries have the lowest CPMs of most other cities I want to run in with a HUGE amount of interest in rock music. I’ll actually allocate a large % of our daily spend to Indonesia and the Philippines because they’re awesome and I would love to tour there LOL.  Once geo is set, I’ll age-target to 18-44 or 49 (depending on the audience size). We’ll also “interest target” with an “AND” statement. One portion of the target will just be “Spotify”, while the other will be bands, genres, and events we’re similar to (All Time Low, Pop Punk, Warped Tour, etc). This tells Meta to find fans who use Spotify AND ALSO are fans of our genre.

introduce you to their followers/fans so long as you aren’t a dick) overall, if a collab is a fit, it’s a real win-win for everyone involved. we found a feature for every track on this ep through different means. some were via introductions from folks we’ve met in the music industry. some were cold-calls via instagram. and others were found right here on reddit in r/popunkers. only one feature requested payment (everyone else was open to the exposure/free content), so we spent $300 in total from a feature standpoint.  prerelease prep we pitched our first single “one more shot” to spotify a bit over a month in advance of our release date. at the very least, folks recommend pitching 4 weeks ahead of your release date so metadata can be ingested into spotify and internal playlist curators can review the track for placement. the song as of now hasn’t been added to an editorial playlist, but see below for our playlist pitch *nyc's shower beers recruit sydney au heavyweights soso for an intl. pop punk riff-fest. monster gang-vocal chorus (050) gives way to mile-a-minute verse (118) that jumps from easycore to ska with total abandon ( a the sopranos sample for fun). prod. by hidden in plain view's rob freeman (cobra starship/gym class heroes) & mastered by grammy-nominated mike kalajian, would fit on pop punk's not dead or skatepark punks. promo includes a press/ad campaign via don't blink mgmt  a full featured ep* we hit multiple points here in 500 characters the areas we’re both from, that the track is a collab, our genre is pop punk, timestamps on relevant high points in the track for review, a few stylistic points to raise intrigue, namedropping who produced/mastered the track  their previous work to establish credibility, what specific playlists we’d like to be on, and how we’re promoting the track (and by so doing promote spotify). you want your pitch to quickly explain who you are, why the track is worth listening to, and where you belong. take as much guesswork away from a curator – they listen to so much music they don’t have more than a few seconds to give you. amazon music also allows you to pitch songs prerelease – we used much of the same as above although they will allow you more characters. now that the track was pitched, we had about 5 weeks to prepare for how we were going to promote this. below are what we felt were the tools at our disposal · social media content (ig/tiktok for the most part, followed by reddit/threads/twitter/youtube) · instagram ads · publisher/blog outreach · radio outreach · user-generated playlist pitching · podcast outreach · email marketing pr i partnered with don’t blink management, but below is what we wrote in regards to publishers (with relevant links removed) *subject pr 11/9 release nyc pop punk band shower beers big-riff single* *tldr - shower beers is dropping ""one more shot"" (the debut single off our new ep featuring australian heavyweights soso) on 11/9 and hope \pubname\ would be interested in covering the track.*  *hi \name\,* *i'm \yourname\ from the nyc-based pop punk band shower beers. i'm reaching out as i noticed you've covered some pop-punk acts in the past \example here\ - we were hoping \name\ would consider covering our new single ""one more shot"" on or after our november 9th release.* *streaming and download available at the private soundcloud link below* *previewlink* *produced at audio pilot studios by rob freeman (gym class heroes, cobra starship, hidden in plain view), ""one more shot"" is the debut single off our 2nd ep ""miracle on 34th & 3rd."" we teamed up with the saucy lads in soso from sydney, australia to create what we feel is an international smash. idobi radio once referred to our music as ""an uppercut with brass knuckles"" - we hope \name\ will agree.* *feel free to reach out to me at this email if you have questions or need any more information. i've included our official press release via don't blink management here and our epk here.* *thank you for your consideration!* the subject line clearly defines what the email is about (calling out location and genre). i add a tldr at the top so editors don’t have to read too much before determining if this request is in their wheelhouse (you should only be reaching out to folks in your genre regardless). i try to be personal by finding editor names if i can and providing mine. i’m not attaching mp3 files but using streaming/download links – it’s rude to fill someone’s inbox storage with files. again, i’m providing credibility with our producer’s namedrop and a link to a previous article written about us by a publisher in the scene (idobi radio). i end with our press release and epk so editors should have everything needed to produce content. the easiest way to find publishers is to be knowledgeable in your community. i read a good amount of the sites i reach out to. but in some cases, the 2nd easiest thing to do is google artists that are a bit more popular than you are and see who is writing about them. this way you’ll quickly put together a pr database in your genre. with radio, it was much of the same as above. first i listed all radio stations in our genre i knew of. then, i googled our genres  radio (pop punk radio, punk rock radio, easycore radio, etc). once i scraped those, i used spotify analytics to find out which countries were listening to pop punk artists the most. for example, germany and indonesia are in our top 5 countries, so i made sure to spend extra time researching german and indonesian rock stations. then, i checked tour schedules for pop punk artists and found what us states indexed highest amongst the genre. after i had that list, i looked for the top rock-leaning college radio stations in those states. most collegiate stations will have program grids that list what songs/genres they’ve previously played. spending a few minutes looking for names that match your genre can help you identify who you want to reach out to and who you can skip.  a note on radio outreach you’ll want to use google drive or dropbox to host files since most stations will want larger .wav masters. you’ll also need to include a clean version of your track, specifically with college radios who try to remain fcc compliant. if you don’t produce your own music, you can easily use reaper or another daw to quickly edit curse words out (i’ll use a tape stop on bad words for example).  for social influencers, our pr agency had a roster they like to work with. on our end, i just reach out to my pals that have some pull and let them know we dropped a track. whether they promote that or not is on their own accord. if there is an influencer i really want to hear our track, i’ll dm them and then comment on a recent post to check their dms. it’s a lil intrusive but part of the game so i don’t think anyone gets too annoyed so long as you’re nice. with podcasts, i’ll only reach out to shows i’ve listened to before. that way i understand how to prep for the convo and have background on the hosts.  an underappreciated aspect of going through the pr process is that at the very least, you’ll be introducing your brand and content to folks who are considered tastemakers. so while our first go here might not yield too much success, our name should become more familiar to influencers in the scene which hopefully can compound down the line.  social content from a social media standpoint, i’m good enough with davinci resolve, on-screen text relevant to your brand that preps the viewer to watch your video, and a caption to engage them to comment. i’m admittedly not great at this but try to keep it in mind. playlist pitching playlist pitching is a double-edged sword. if you’re in a specific genre like we are (pop punk), it’s a bit easier to find relevant playlists. if you’re in a broad genre like pop or rap, you’re going to have a really hard time getting playlist success without paying/getting botted. just how it seems to be. for us, we used 5 tools for our playlist database submithub, groover, dailyplaylists, playlistsupply, and spotify’s “discovered on” section. submithub to pitch to 25 playlists, of which 7 approved. those 7 playlists resulted in an additional \~700 streams thus far. groover. i’ve seen a minor streaming jump on some playlists, nothing crazy though. at the very least with 20 free submissions a week. so far only 3 playlists have accepted us and the lift has been minimal, but that’s what we expect with free submissions. playlistsupply, then larger similar artists (blink-182, sum 41, simple plan, beartooth, state champs, etc), then moods (workout, drinking, party, pregame, lifting, racing, etc). all said and done, i sent emails to 90 contacts day-of release with a pitch. playlistsupply is $20 a month and i cancel the first month after collecting emails. unfortunately every playlist i found via playlistsupply asked for money (over $10 in most cases) to be placed on questionable playlists, so i won’t be using the service again for pop punk.  lastly, i’ll email influencers and other social media movers who run playlists/playlists i find from other artists “discovered on” section on spotify. i sent about 25 extra emails this way and so far it’s resulted in an extra \~45 streams. altogether our playlisting efforts took $105 for about \~20 extra playlist additions resulting in \~1,050 extra streams after 3 weeks. i think submithub is the best for poppunk, groover is fine to supplement, and dailyplaylist is a ""nice to have."" i don't think playlistsupply is worth it as of now. email marketing we can be better at this. we only collect emails via distrokid’s “presave” function and i feel like the presave wave is dead at this point. fans are too tired to click a link every time we drop a song and allow some third party access to their spotify, so we stopped pushing that. instead we just are asking our followers on instagram to follow us on spotify too. all this to say email is not really a tool we use much yet, but a lot of more established artists do. i didn’t send an email for this track, but folks should consider email. instagram ads our strategy is very specific here. i’ll only buy instagram story ads (no facebook ads due to high bot traffic, no ig reels because i just don’t like them). from here, i’ll make 3-4 pieces of very colorful, engaging creative with lyrics from different hooks in our song with a message to “swipe up for spotify.” you can probably find an example on our socials of one of the lyric videos that’ll look a bit like the ad we use. from a targeting standpoint, i’ll run 3 separate ad set tiers based on cities. tier 1 “cities” are just the us, uk, and australia. tier 2 cities are music hotspots in pop-punk/our spotify analytics. this will include canadian, brazilian, mexican, german, and italian cities plus whatever other cities are jumping out in our song-specific analytics. lastly i’ll run tier 3 cities solely to metros in indonesia and the philippines. these countries have the lowest cpms of most other cities i want to run in with a huge amount of interest in rock music. i’ll actually allocate a large % of our daily spend to indonesia and the philippines because they’re awesome and i would love to tour there lol.  once geo is set, i’ll age-target to 18-44 or 49 (depending on the audience size). we’ll also “interest target” with an “and” statement. one portion of the target will just be “spotify”, while the other will be bands, genres, and events we’re similar to (all time low, pop punk, warped tour, etc). this tells meta to find fans who use spotify and also are fans of our genre. folks like andrew southward will preach fine-tuning this strategy by using a/b testing on specific interest targets and utilizing conversion pixels vs simply optimizing to clickthrough. i get that, but i’m just a man. eventually we’ll optimize this process but for now the easy way is working for us. i’ll allocate about $4 a day for a month – currently trying $2 to tier 1, $2 to tier 3, and $1 to tier 2. so far we’ve spent $95 for \~650 link clicks against \~100k impressions, which is about $0.15 per click (which is what we expect). per our geo reporting in fb ad manager and spotify for artists, it does seem to correlate a bit, but we can be better here by utilizing conversion vs our simple clickthrough ad goal.  day of release about 24-48 hours before launch, i’ll follow up with everyone who agreed to cover our song to see if they need anything else. i’ll also start teasing a track on social 7 days in advance of the release date and ask folks to follow us on spotify. week of, i’ll try to drop a small teaser a day – not enough to ruin the surprise but enough to stay engaged. the day prior to dropping i’ll most likely share a piece of content with the chorus/hook. so if we’re dropping a track thursday, on monday i’ll post a clip with some ambient filters on the song, tuesday i’ll highlight a riff, and wednesday we’ll show the chorus before a midnight thursday drop. i take day-of releasing pretty seriously – i think time is of the essence if you want to get algorithms to notice your new content. so i’ll snag a few red bulls, try to nap a bit when i get home from work, and be awake and ready to rock for the midnight drop. once the song is live, the below is exactly what i’ll do into the early morning 1. i’ll immediately post on my story about the song dropping 2. i’ll set our instagram ads live (as we need the spotify link for a clickthrough before publishing ads on that platform) 3. i’ll send an email blast to our presave email list asking them to listen and share the song on socials. easy message, keep it light. 4. i’ll update all our websites – our link in bio, upload a visualizer to our youtube channel, upload files to soundcloud and bandcamp, submit the track to pandora amp’d, etc. 5. i’ll playlist pitch to submithub, then dailyplaylist, then groover 6. i’ll submit the track to be ingested by musixmatch. i’ll also use this downtime to start tracking demos for our next ep since being in the music cycle is a never-ending hamster wheel that forces you to continuously move until you fall off or die.  total cost if we’re estimating/fudging costs from start to finish, i’m spending about    |creating the ep|$3,500| |-|-| |features|$300| |pr|$400| |playlists|$105| |ads|$100| |total|$4,405| is it worth it? our band has over 100k streams total after existing for a year, with our top track at 38k streams. we peaked at 10k monthly listeners back when we dropped our acoustic track in may but average around 2k monthlies when not releasing music. we’re at 7k monthlies right now, and our song has been in the discover weekly algorithm for just over a week. so is dropping \~$4,400 on recording an ep and promoting a single to an audience this size worth it? end of the day, we created something cool and it was heard by others (and sometimes even enjoyed). a few times i’ve met strangers in public at shows and they mentioned how much they liked shower beers. it continuously provides me with a sense of purpose and fulfillment. so yeah, while it’s a bit pricey, i think it’s worth it. now if someone wanted to do music for a career, this whole scenario becomes a lot more stressful. this is a ton of work for very little monetary upside. what can we do better? i know a few areas i’ve self-critiqued if i wanted to get better at this whole thing · we don’t really play too many shows yet (it’s a lot of money and logistics to tour). we’re looking to start opening for folks in the nyc area to get started · i should accept my fate and start producing more personalized social content (get in front of the camera and dance my little dance) · i can spend more times in niche social platforms like discords, twitch streams, and yt shorts · i can learn/operate instagram advertising more efficiently via conversion pixels and a/b testing · we should start selling merch for additional income and roll that shop into email collection · spend time creating and managing a vehicle for more organic content (whether that be managing my own music blog, starting a podcast, etc) if we’re being honest, i’m probably not going to try any of the above anytime soon (outside of playling live) because our current promotion efforts take so much time away from what i really enjoy, which is writing and recording music. but i do find fulfillment in being heard, so this all does feel a bit necessary. hopefully this 8 page rundown helps a musician in the future plan for their release. being a successful musician today is pretty much an exercise in being a full-time brand manager. to summarize, you’ve gotta ensure your music is professional in all aspects, take the pitching process seriously, learn advertising, pr, and content creation, and try to remember that music is fun. hope you liked this. if you want,

186yq46,1701288466.0,IntheMusic,MasterHeartless,Where is a music marketing budget best spent in 2024?,"I’m working with many artists who are just getting started and most of them have a lot of music ready for release, some even have music videos and are active on social media but they don’t have a big enough following to make any impact with their releases.

183szf1,1700944851.0,edmproduction,Facts-and-Logic-999,Help decoding dumb feedback from Submithub curators,"Okay, so I released this dubstep tune a few weeks ago, not my first time around the block, but I would describe my production skills overall as decent but not great. Upon the release, I sent my track to about 15 or so blog/playlist curators on Submithub and Groover and it was unanimously rejected across the board.  Can't say I'm terribly surprised based on my experience in the scene so far, but I am a bit caught off guard and frustrated by the feedback that I got, and what I understand to be dubstep-industry-isms that just don't really make sense to me. 

I'm actually very open to feedback and using it to improve my skills and music quality, but in order for me to do that, it has to actually make sense. So therefore, I'm wondering if someone could help translate dubstep-gatekeeper-speak into plain english for me? I'll list some of the feedback points I got in order from most stupid to least stupid:

&amp;#x200B;

1. ""It sounds like you're using too many presets""

Well that's funny, because I'm literally not using any. I might have used some pads or something from Omnisphere or Kontakt in the background, but all the basses/leads/arps etc. are created by me from scratch 95% of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. ""Your sounds sound too old""

Old? I made them all for this track and have never used any of them before. I've not listened to every dubstep track in existence, but I don't know of any other tracks that have used these exact sounds. I'm sure there are examples of similar sounds out there, but it's not like I'm ripping off any particular track or artist.

&amp;#x200B;

3. ""Your mix/master has problems""

I literally hired a professional engineer to mix and master it, but ok.

&amp;#x200B;

4. ""Your drop isn't loud enough""

By ""not loud enough"" I'm assuming they mean ""not compressed enough"", because if you look at the waveform of the track, there's really not much if any headroom left in there during the drop. My engineer and I had tried further compressing the bass group, but it ended up sounding messy and distorted, so we opted for only moderate compression on the bass sounds. I guess this the closest to a valid point of the things listed here, but it's hard for me to picture an average listener going through a playlist and saying ""eww sounds like this producer didn't use enough sausage fattner on their basses"", especially considering how many boring/uncreative tracks are on those same playlists.

17rf3vl,1699542739.0,musicmarketing,ShowerBeersMusic,SONG RELEASE PLAN: This Is How an Indie Pop Punk Band Promotes New Music in 2023,"Hey. We just dropped a new single, and during the runup to our release I utilized a ton of random reddit threads along with what I already knew about the music marketing process to properly get the word out. I compiled EVERYTHING we did for a single song release in this (long) post with the hopes it might help someone down the line – hopefully consolidating it all is useful. I’ve also included cost breakdowns where appropriate (I’m not giving rates to our partners that aren’t publicly advertising pricing cause I think that’s rude). Gonna preface that I don’t really have any idea what I’m doing, so who knows what’s good advice and what isn’t here. Buckle up.

BACKGROUND: we’re a very independent pop punk band. This means a few things:

1. We have a somewhat niche genre and audience target. This is important, as it allows us to dig in deeper with our research and community than if we were a standard pop, rap, EDM, or even country artist. Some of the below that works for us won’t work for more saturated genres.
2. We don’t have the financial backing or professional connections a label would provide, so all marketing is either DIY or out of our own pockets. Also no manager/mentor, so really winging it and seeing what sticks.
3. Because we make rock music, it takes a bit longer to write and record songs compared to a pop singer or rapper who *could* just hop on a beat via any number of producers. So the “release a song every week” advice is a bit tougher for us to do. Obvi not the same for everyone, but it inherently is a bit tougher for rock artists to track that many songs that quickly. On that note, you gotta make a bigger deal when you DO drop music since it’s less frequent.

RECORDING PROCESS

This is where a successful marketing campaign must start. If your song sucks from a songwriting/production standpoint, it SHOULDN’T matter how much you advertise. Unless you’re a plant or marketing genius, it’s prob not going to work out.

We found a studio that’s worked with professional artists in our genre ([Audio Pilot Studios](https://www.audiopilotproduction.com/) in NJ). For a 4 song EP, I wrote around 20 songs, demoed 14, and settled on 4. This is important because we’re not walking into the studio “waiting for inspiration strike” or “seeing how the energy goes.” It is very chill if you have enough capital to spend time writing in-studio. Studios are creative spaces and I’m sure that’s an awesome experience. But since we’re bankrolling the session ourselves, I always want to walk in with the songs as close to complete as possible. Obviously working with a producer means certain changes will happen in the moment (and be prepared to be open to those), but you don’t want to waste time on layups like melodies, lyrics, strumming patterns, who plays what, etc. Caveating this doesn’t mean much if you truly can self-produce a record at a high-quality level. We unfortunately can’t do that LOL.

Once tracking and mixing was complete, we shot the EP off to our mastering house at [Rogue Planet Mastering](https://www.rogueplanetmastering.com/). I’m a big believer in a real mastering engineer being able to take your track from 90% to 100% - it gets you that much closer to a high quality record.

I’m not going to break out all of the costs for the recording process specific to our experience, but a decent rule of thumb is you could expect $1k a song all-in, so let’s say \~$4,000 for this exercise. Obviously that can be less if you’re efficient, and way more if you stink and are being charged by the hour. These costs can balloon quickly if you’re not efficient.

COLLABORATION

I am a huge fan of partnering with artists on tracks. It’s more important now than ever for a few reasons.

1. It gives me a chance to hang and chat with artists I like
2. It brings new (and better?) voices onto the tracks, which provides more texture
3. It helps other artists as they get a fully-produced track to hop on – this is free high quality content creation without any cost beyond slightly associating themselves with us.
4. It alerts fanbases AND streaming algorithms who is part of which scene. This helps serve your songs to your target community with more accuracy.
5. It gives you a partner when marketing the track (features aren’t required to promote, but most will help introduce you to their followers/fans so long as you aren’t a dick)

Overall, if a collab is a fit, it’s a real win-win for everyone involved. We found a feature for every track on this EP through different means. Some were via introductions from folks we’ve met in the music industry. Some were cold-calls via Instagram. And others were found right here on reddit in r/popunkers. Only one feature requested payment (everyone else was open to the exposure/free content), so we spent $300 in total from a feature standpoint.

PRERELEASE PREP

We pitched our first single “One More Shot” to Spotify a bit over a month in advance of our release date. At the very least, folks recommend pitching 4 weeks ahead of your release date so metadata can be ingested into Spotify and internal playlist curators can review the track for placement. We’ve never been on an editorial playlist yet, but see below for our playlist pitch:

*NYC's Shower Beers recruit Sydney AU heavyweights SoSo for an intl. pop punk riff-fest. Monster gang-vocal chorus (0:50) gives way to mile-a-minute verse (1:18) that jumps from easycore to ska with total abandon (+ a The Sopranos sample for fun). Prod. by Hidden In Plain View's Rob Freeman (Cobra Starship/Gym Class Heroes) &amp; mastered by Grammy-nominated Mike Kalajian, would fit on Pop Punk's Not Dead or Skatepark Punks. Promo includes a press/ad campaign via Don't Blink Mgmt + a full featured EP*

We hit multiple points here in 500 characters: the areas we’re BOTH from, that the track is a collab, our genre is pop punk, timestamps on relevant high points in the track for review, a few stylistic points to raise intrigue, namedropping who produced/mastered the track + their previous work to establish credibility, what specific playlists we’d like to be on, and how we’re promoting the track (and by so doing promote Spotify). You want your pitch to quickly explain who you are, why the track is worth listening to, and where you belong. Take as much guesswork away from a curator – they listen to so much music they don’t have more than a few seconds to give you. Amazon Music also allows you to pitch songs prerelease – we used much of the same as above although they will allow you more characters.

Now that the track was pitched, we had about 5 weeks to prepare for how we were going to promote this. Below are what we felt were the tools at our disposal:

• Social Media Content (IG/TikTok for the most part, followed by Reddit/Threads/Twitter/Youtube)

• Instagram Ads

• Publisher/Blog Outreach

• Radio Outreach

• User-Generated Playlist Pitching

• Podcast Outreach

• Email Marketing

PR

I partnered with [Don’t Blink Management](https://www.dontblinkmg.com/) so we could utilize their established connections to gain a foothold with more popular publishers. I won’t give DBM’s specific rates. But we reached out to about 5 PR agencies and the average quoted cost was around $300-$1,000 for an independent band’s PR depending on what you want, so for this exercise let’s rock with $600. Between the two of us, we ended up contacting around the below:

MEDIA TYPE EMAILS SENT APPROVALS

Publisher/Blog 163 14

Radio 160 4

Podcast 20 3

Social Influencer\* 19 2

\*we’ll continue reaching out to social influencers now that the track is out, as it’s easier to pitch when the song is in IG/TikTok libraries (also I'm having a hard time with tables on reddit so hopefully this makes sense)

So yeah, it’s a lot of work for a \~6% hit rate. Folks will debate the benefit of PR and Radio in today’s music landscape, but pretty much I think it’s fun to see stuff get published or aired about our band. And end of the day, you do music because it’s fun, so I think it’s worth it.

I’m not going to give every PR template I have (you’ll change your message based on publisher/radio/podcasts), but below is what we wrote in regards to publishers (with relevant links removed):

**SUBJECT: PR 11/9 Release: NYC Pop Punk Band Shower Beers Big-Riff Single**

*TL:DR - Shower Beers is dropping ""One More Shot"" (the debut single off our new EP featuring Australian heavyweights SoSo) on 11/9 and hope \[PUBNAME\] would be interested in covering the track.*

*Hi \[NAME\],*

*I'm \[YOURNAME\] from the NYC-based pop punk band Shower Beers. I'm reaching out as I noticed you've covered some pop-punk acts in the past \[EXAMPLE HERE\] - we were hoping \[NAME\] would consider covering our new single ""One More Shot"" on or after our November 9th release.*

*Streaming and download available at the private Soundcloud link below:*

*PREVIEWLINK*

*Produced at Audio Pilot Studios by Rob Freeman (Gym Class Heroes, Cobra Starship, Hidden In Plain View), ""One More Shot"" is the debut single off our 2nd EP ""Miracle on 34th &amp; 3rd."" We teamed up with the saucy lads in SoSo from Sydney, Australia to create what we feel is an international smash. Idobi Radio once referred to our music as ""an uppercut with brass knuckles"" - we hope \[NAME\] will agree.*

*Feel free to reach out to me at this email if you have questions or need any more information. I've included our official press release via Don't Blink Management HERE and our EPK HERE.*

*Thank you for your consideration!*

The subject line clearly defines what the email is about (calling out location and genre). I add a TL:DR at the top so editors don’t have to read too much before determining if this request is in their wheelhouse (you should only be reaching out to folks in your genre regardless). I try to be personal by finding editor names if I can and providing mine. I’m NOT attaching MP3 files but using streaming/download links – it’s rude to fill someone’s inbox storage with files. Again, I’m providing credibility with our producer’s namedrop AND a link to a previous article written about us by a publisher in the scene (Idobi Radio). I end with our Press Release and EPK so editors should have everything needed to produce content.

The easiest way to find publishers is to be knowledgeable in your community. I read a good amount of the sites I reach out to. But in some cases, the 2nd easiest thing to do is Google artists that are a bit more popular than you are and see who is writing about them. This way you’ll quickly put together a PR database in your genre.

With Radio, it was much of the same as above. First I listed all radio stations in our genre I knew of. Then, I googled our genres + radio (pop punk radio, punk rock radio, easycore radio, etc). Once I scraped those, I used Spotify analytics to find out which countries were listening to pop punk artists the most. For example, Germany and Indonesia are in our top 5 countries, so I made sure to spend extra time researching German and Indonesian rock stations. Then, I checked tour schedules for pop punk artists and found what US states indexed highest amongst the genre. After I had that list, I looked for the top rock-leaning COLLEGE radio stations in those states. Most collegiate stations will have program grids that list what songs/genres they’ve previously played. Spending a few minutes looking for names that match your genre can help you identify who you want to reach out to and who you can skip.

A note on radio outreach: you’ll want to use Google Drive or Dropbox to host files since most stations will want larger .WAV masters. You’ll ALSO need to include a clean version of your track, specifically with College Radios who try to remain FCC compliant. If you don’t produce your own music, you can easily use Reaper or another DAW to quickly edit curse words out (I’ll use a tape stop on bad words for example).

For Social Influencers, our PR Agency had a roster they like to work with. On our end, I just reach out to my pals that have some pull and let them know we dropped a track. Whether they promote that or not is on their own accord. If there is an influencer I really want to hear our track, I’ll DM them and then comment on a recent post to check their DMs. It’s a lil intrusive but part of the game so I don’t think anyone gets too annoyed so long as you’re nice.

With Podcasts, I’ll only reach out to shows I’ve listened to before. That way I understand how to prep for the convo and have background on the hosts.

An underappreciated aspect of going through the PR process is that at the very least, you’ll be introducing your brand and content to folks who are considered tastemakers. So while our first go here might not yield too much success, our name should become more familiar to influencers in the scene which hopefully can compound down the line.

SOCIAL CONTENT

From a social media standpoint, I’m good enough with [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) and [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/) to edit together stupid social content. Both systems are free and can be learned via some time on Youtube. As of writing this, I’ve made 50 pieces of SFV content that can be posted to support the track. I’ll probably end up with 60-70 posts. On Instagram I focus on more comedic/skit content using our music. TikTok is more engineered for spamming discoverable content, so I’ll focus on clips like lyric videos. This is personal, but I don’t like the cute TikToks of singing to a camera or whatever. I just don’t wanna do it. That probably hurts us, but I work hard to put out different content that I HOPE differentiates a bit from the thousands of musicians on social media filming in their backyards or bedrooms. I’m probably wrong here, but it is what it is, I don’t wanna lipsync in the bathroom.

I’ll also use social media to stay in contact with other artists/individuals I like in the scene. Give your pals engagement on socials, it only helps their posts.

On TikTok in particular, I’ll look at what similar artists who are having success are using as captions, hashtags, and on-screen text. The way I look at it is you use hashtags to inform the algorithm who to start serving to at first (fans of your micro-genre), on-screen text relevant to your brand that preps the viewer to watch your video, and a caption to engage them to comment. I’m admittedly not great at this but try to keep it in mind.

PLAYLIST PITCHING

Playlist pitching is a double-edged sword. If you’re in a specific genre like we are (pop punk), it’s a bit easier to find relevant playlists. If you’re in a broad genre like pop or rap, you’re going to have a really hard time getting playlist success without paying/getting botted. Just how it seems to be.

For us, we used 5 tools for our playlist database: [Submithub](https://www.submithub.com/), [Groover](https://groover.co/en/), [Dailyplaylists](https://dailyplaylists.com/), [Playlistsupply](https://playlistsupply.com/), and Spotify’s “Discovered On” section.

Submithub works for us because they have a lot of pop-punk specific playlists curated by individuals who like our band. We’ll see on average a 30% success rate with about 40 credits used per track. That comes out to $45 spent for 3,000-4,000 extra listeners and 5,500ish streams all-time, so not too bad. Again, our music is studio quality and we know our genre (which can’t be said for some other artists), so I understand why so many folks complain about not having success on this service. It works decently enough for us.

Groover I’ve never used before but saw u/MakePopMusic say he liked it. I checked through the service for pop-punk playlists that would push the needle for us and found 5 that I wanted to pitch to. That ended up costing me like \~$20 for this single, so not too much. Will report back how this works.

Dailyplaylist is free which I love (we also curate a playlist here). I’ve seen a minor streaming jump on some playlists, nothing crazy though. At the very least with 20 free submissions a week, I’ve seen a few extra hundred listeners after using the site for a month or two.

Playlistsupply is a scraper for Spotify data. It will return playlist follower size and relevant contact info if available like email or social. I’ll start by searching our genre (Pop Punk, Punk, Emo, Alternative, Indie Rock, Rock, Metal, Metalcore, Easycore, Breakdown, etc), then larger similar artists (blink-182, Sum 41, Simple Plan, Beartooth, State Champs, etc), then MOODS (workout, drinking, party, pregame, lifting, racing, etc). All said and done, I’ll collect about 80-100 extra contacts to email day-of release with a pitch. Playlistsupply is $20 a month and I’ll cancel the first month after collecting what I need to collect. This is the first time I’m seriously using Playlistsupply and will report back, but so far 100% of my responses have asked for pay-to-place so the experience isn’t great at this point. (I’ve read enough about all the different playlisting sites and these really are the only four I’ll bother with.)

Lastly, I’ll go to similar artists on Spotify and check their “Discovered On” section via desktop. For the most part it’s easy to tell what playlists are Spotify generated and what are user-generated. I’ll typically find a few extra emails by clicking the top playlists for artists. Will report back on email responses.

EMAIL MARKETING

We can be better at this. We only collect emails via Distrokid’s “presave” function and I feel like the presave wave is dead at this point. Fans are too tired to click a link every time we drop a song and allow some third party access to their Spotify, so we stopped pushing that. Instead we just are asking our followers on Instagram to follow us on Spotify too. All this to say email is not really a tool we use much yet, but a lot of more established artists do.

INSTAGRAM ADS

Our strategy is very specific here. I’ll only buy Instagram story ads (no Facebook ads due to high bot traffic, no IG reels because I just don’t like them). From here, I’ll make 3-4 pieces of very colorful, engaging creative with lyrics from different hooks in our song with a message to “swipe up for Spotify.” You can probably find an example on our socials of one of the lyric videos that’ll look a bit like the ad we use.

From a targeting standpoint, I’ll run 3 separate ad set tiers based on cities. Tier 1 “cities” are just the US, UK, and Australia. Tier 2 cities are music hotspots in pop-punk/our Spotify analytics. This will include Canadian, Brazilian, Mexican, German, and Italian cities plus whatever other cities are jumping out in our song-specific analytics. Lastly I’ll run Tier 3 cities solely to metros in Indonesia and the Philippines. These countries have the lowest CPMs of most other cities I want to run in with a HUGE amount of interest in rock music. I’ll actually allocate a large % of our daily spend to Indonesia and the Philippines because they’re awesome and I would love to tour there LOL.

Once geo is set, I’ll age-target to 18-44 or 49 (depending on the audience size). We’ll also “interest target” with an “AND” statement. One portion of the target will just be “Spotify”, while the other will be bands, genres, and events we’re similar to (All Time Low, Pop Punk, Warped Tour, etc). This tells Meta to find fans who use Spotify AND ALSO are fans of our genre. Folks like [Andrew Southward](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCajL-kaSv6A4-sNoX-U99Qw) will preach fine-tuning this strategy by using A/B testing on specific interest targets and utilizing conversion pixels vs simply optimizing to clickthrough. I get that, but I’m just a man. Eventually we’ll optimize this process but for now the easy way is working for us. I’ll allocate about $4 a day for a month – currently trying $2 to Tier 1, $2 to Tier 3, and $1 to Tier 2. This will result in about a $0.12 cost per click for $120, which will result in about 1,000 new listeners to our page.

DAY OF RELEASE

About 24-48 hours before launch, I’ll follow up with everyone who agreed to cover our song to see if they need anything else. I’ll also start teasing a track on social 7 days in advance of the release date and ask folks to follow us on Spotify. Week of, I’ll try to drop a small teaser a day – not enough to ruin the surprise but enough to stay engaged. The day prior to dropping I’ll most likely share a piece of content with the chorus/hook. So if we’re dropping a track Thursday, on Monday I’ll post a clip with some ambient filters on the song, Tuesday I’ll highlight a riff, and Wednesday we’ll show the chorus before a midnight Thursday drop.

I take day-of releasing pretty seriously – I think time is of the essence if you want to get algorithms to notice your new content. So I’ll snag a few Red Bulls, try to nap a bit when I get home from work, and be awake and ready to rock for the midnight drop. Once the song is live, the below is exactly what I’ll do into the early morning:

1. I’ll immediately post on my STORY about the song dropping
2. I’ll set our Instagram ads live (as we need the Spotify link for a clickthrough before publishing ads on that platform)
3. I’ll send an email blast to our presave email list asking them to listen and share the song on socials. Easy message, keep it light.
4. I’ll update all our websites – our link in bio, upload a visualizer to our YouTube channel, upload files to Soundcloud and Bandcamp, submit the track to Pandora Amp’d, etc.
5. I’ll playlist pitch to Submithub, then Dailyplaylist, then Groover
6. I’ll submit the track to be ingested by Musixmatch so our lyrics can be tracked on socials/in Spotify
7. I’ll add our lyrics to Genius
8. I’ll email all the user-generated playlist emails I scrapped from Spotify/PlaylistSupply with a pitch
9. I’ll begin following up with every publisher/radio station/podcast over email with the Spotify link letting them know our song is out and seeing if they were still interested in covering the release
10. From here it’s probably 3AM so I’ll climb into bed and pass out
11. I’ll try to be up at 9AM so I can post our Youtube Visualizer to appropriate Reddit communities
12. I’ll post a release announcement to TikTok at this time as well
13. Instagram, Twitter, and Threads I’ll wait until about 10AM to post on main
14. I’m also part of a few Facebook Groups – I typically never post on Facebook but might give it a shot this time around
15. I’ve also put together some funny flyers I’ll hang up around NYC just for sh!ts and giggles

From there, I’m slogging through a content push over our socials for the next few weeks until it’s time to do it all over again with the next track (since we’re pop punk, we’ll most likely wait until Feb/away from the holidays). I’ll also use this downtime to start tracking demos for our next EP since being in the music cycle is a never-ending hamster wheel that forces you to continuously move until you fall off or die.

TOTAL COST

If we’re estimating/fudging costs from start to finish (again some of these aren’t the actual costs of my studio/PR), I’m spending about:

Creating the EP $4,000

Features $300

PR $600

Playlisting $85

Ads $120

TOTAL $5,105

IS IT WORTH IT?

Our band has about 100k streams total after existing for a year, with our top track at 36k streams. We peaked at 10k monthly listeners back when we dropped our acoustic track in May but average around 2k monthlies when not releasing music. So is dropping \~$5,105 on recording an EP and promoting a single to an audience this size worth it? End of the day, we created something cool and it was heard by others (and sometimes even enjoyed). A few times I’ve met strangers in public at shows and they mentioned how much they liked our band. It continuously provides me with a sense of purpose. So yeah, while it’s a bit pricey, I think it’s worth it.

Now if someone wanted to do music for a career, this whole scenario becomes a lot more stressful. This is a ton of work for very little monetary upside. I wouldn’t envy someone who’s attempting this without major backing and a comical amount of talent.

WHAT CAN WE DO BETTER?

I know a few areas I’ve self-critiqued if I wanted to get better at this whole thing:

• We don’t really play too many shows yet (it’s a lot of money and logistics to tour). We’re looking to start opening for folks in the NYC area to get started

• I should accept my fate and start producing more personalized social content (get in front of the camera and dance my little dance)

• I can spend more times in niche social platforms like Discords, Twitch Streams, and YT Shorts

• I can learn/operate Instagram advertising more efficiently via conversion pixels and A/B testing

• We should start selling merch for additional income and roll that shop into email collection

• Spend time creating and managing a vehicle for more organic content (whether that be managing my own music blog, starting a podcast, etc)

If we’re being honest, I’m probably not going to try any of the above anytime soon because our current promotion efforts take so much time away from what I really enjoy, which is writing and recording music. But I do find fulfillment in being heard, so this all does feel a bit necessary.

Hopefully this 8 page rundown helps a musician in the future plan for their release. Being a successful musician today is pretty much an exercise in being a full-time brand manager. To summarize, you’ve gotta ensure your music is professional in all aspects, take the pitching process seriously, learn advertising, PR, and content creation, and try to remember that music is fun. Hope you liked it, thanks.

We just dropped a new single, and during the runup to our release I utilized a ton of random reddit threads along with what I already knew about the music marketing process to properly get the word out. I compiled EVERYTHING we did for a single song release in this (long) post with the hopes it might help someone down the line – hopefully consolidating it all is useful. I’ve also included cost breakdowns where appropriate (I’m not giving rates to our partners that aren’t publicly advertising pricing cause I think that’s rude). Gonna preface that I don’t really have any idea what I’m doing, so who knows what’s good advice and what isn’t here. Buckle up. BACKGROUND we’re a very independent pop punk band. This means a few things 1. We have a somewhat niche genre and audience target. This is important, as it allows us to dig in deeper with our research and community than if we were a standard pop, rap, EDM, or even country artist. Some of the below that works for us won’t work for more saturated genres. 2. We don’t have the financial backing or professional connections a label would provide, so all marketing is either DIY or out of our own pockets. Also no manager/mentor, so really winging it and seeing what sticks. 3. Because we make rock music, it takes a bit longer to write and record songs compared to a pop singer or rapper who *could* just hop on a beat via any number of producers. So the “release a song every week” advice is a bit tougher for us to do. Obvi not the same for everyone, but it inherently is a bit tougher for rock artists to track that many songs that quickly. On that note, you gotta make a bigger deal when you DO drop music since it’s less frequent. RECORDING PROCESS This is where a successful marketing campaign must start. If your song sucks from a songwriting/production standpoint, it SHOULDN’T matter how much you advertise. Unless you’re a plant or marketing genius, it’s prob not going to work out. We found a studio that’s worked with professional artists in our genre (Audio Pilot Studios. For a 4 song EP, I wrote around 20 songs, demoed 14, and settled on 4. This is important because we’re not walking into the studio “waiting for inspiration strike” or “seeing how the energy goes.” It is very chill if you have enough capital to spend time writing in-studio. Studios are creative spaces and I’m sure that’s an awesome experience. But since we’re bankrolling the session ourselves, I always want to walk in with the songs as close to complete as possible. Obviously working with a producer means certain changes will happen in the moment (and be prepared to be open to those), but you don’t want to waste time on layups like melodies, lyrics, strumming patterns, who plays what, etc. Caveating this doesn’t mean much if you truly can self-produce a record at a high-quality level. We unfortunately can’t do that LOL. Once tracking and mixing was complete, we shot the EP off to our mastering house at Rogue Planet Mastering voices onto the tracks, which provides more texture 3. It helps other artists as they get a fully-produced track to hop on – this is free high quality content creation without any cost beyond slightly associating themselves with us. 4. It alerts fanbases AND streaming algorithms who is part of which scene. This helps serve your songs to your target community with more accuracy. 5. It gives you a partner when marketing the track (features aren’t required to promote, but most will help introduce you to their followers/fans so long as you aren’t a dick) Overall, if a collab is a fit, it’s a real win-win for everyone involved. We found a feature for every track on this EP through different means. Some were via introductions from folks we’ve met in the music industry. Some were cold-calls via Instagram. And others were found right here on reddit in r/popunkers. Only one feature requested payment (everyone else was open to the exposure/free content), so we spent $300 in total from a feature standpoint. PRERELEASE PREP We pitched our first single “One More Shot” to Spotify a bit over a month in advance of our release date. At the very least, folks recommend pitching 4 weeks ahead of your release date so metadata can be ingested into Spotify and internal playlist curators can review the track for placement. We’ve never been on an editorial playlist yet, but see below for our playlist pitch *NYC's Shower Beers recruit Sydney AU heavyweights SoSo for an intl. pop punk riff-fest. Monster gang-vocal chorus (050) gives way to mile-a-minute verse (118) that jumps from easycore to ska with total abandon ( a The Sopranos sample for fun). Prod. by Hidden In Plain View's Rob Freeman (Cobra Starship/Gym Class Heroes) & mastered by Grammy-nominated Mike Kalajian, would fit on Pop Punk's Not Dead or Skatepark Punks. Promo includes a press/ad campaign via Don't Blink Mgmt  a full featured EP* We hit multiple points here in 500 characters the areas we’re BOTH from, that the track is a collab, our genre is pop punk, timestamps on relevant high points in the track for review, a few stylistic points to raise intrigue, namedropping who produced/mastered the track  their previous work to establish credibility, what specific playlists we’d like to be on, and how we’re promoting the track (and by so doing promote Spotify). You want your pitch to quickly explain who you are, why the track is worth listening to, and where you belong. Take as much guesswork away from a curator – they listen to so much music they don’t have more than a few seconds to give you. Amazon Music also allows you to pitch songs prerelease – we used much of the same as above although they will allow you more characters. Now that the track was pitched, we had about 5 weeks to prepare for how we were going to promote this. Below are what we felt were the tools at our disposal • Social Media Content (IG/TikTok for the most part, followed by Reddit/Threads/Twitter/Youtube) • Instagram Ads • Publisher/Blog Outreach • Radio Outreach • User-Generated Playlist Pitching • Podcast Outreach • Email Marketing PR I partnered with Don’t Blink Management So yeah, it’s a lot of work for a \~6% hit rate. Folks will debate the benefit of PR and Radio in today’s music landscape, but pretty much I think it’s fun to see stuff get published or aired about our band. And end of the day, you do music because it’s fun, so I think it’s worth it. I’m not going to give every PR template I have (you’ll change your message based on publisher/radio/podcasts), but below is what we wrote in regards to publishers (with relevant links removed) **SUBJECT PR 11/9 Release NYC Pop Punk Band Shower Beers Big-Riff Single** *TLDR - Shower Beers is dropping ""One More Shot"" (the debut single off our new EP featuring Australian heavyweights SoSo) on 11/9 and hope \PUBNAME\ would be interested in covering the track.* *Hi \NAME\,* *I'm \YOURNAME\ from the NYC-based pop punk band Shower Beers. I'm reaching out as I noticed you've covered some pop-punk acts in the past \EXAMPLE HERE\ - we were hoping \NAME\ would consider covering our new single ""One More Shot"" on or after our November 9th release.* *Streaming and download available at the private Soundcloud link below* *PREVIEWLINK* *Produced at Audio Pilot Studios by Rob Freeman (Gym Class Heroes, Cobra Starship, Hidden In Plain View), ""One More Shot"" is the debut single off our 2nd EP ""Miracle on 34th & 3rd."" We teamed up with the saucy lads in SoSo from Sydney, Australia to create what we feel is an international smash. Idobi Radio once referred to our music as ""an uppercut with brass knuckles"" - we hope \NAME\ will agree.* *Feel free to reach out to me at this email if you have questions or need any more information. I've included our official press release via Don't Blink Management HERE and our EPK HERE.* *Thank you for your consideration!* The subject line clearly defines what the email is about (calling out location and genre). I add a TLDR at the top so editors don’t have to read too much before determining if this request is in their wheelhouse (you should only be reaching out to folks in your genre regardless). I try to be personal by finding editor names if I can and providing mine. I’m NOT attaching MP3 files but using streaming/download links – it’s rude to fill someone’s inbox storage with files. Again, I’m providing credibility with our producer’s namedrop AND a link to a previous article written about us by a publisher in the scene (Idobi Radio). I end with our Press Release and EPK so editors should have everything needed to produce content. The easiest way to find publishers is to be knowledgeable in your community. I read a good amount of the sites I reach out to. But in some cases, the 2nd easiest thing to do is Google artists that are a bit more popular than you are and see who is writing about them. This way you’ll quickly put together a PR database in your genre. With Radio, it was much of the same as above. First I listed all radio stations in our genre I knew of. Then, I googled our genres  radio (pop punk radio, punk rock radio, easycore radio, etc). Once I scraped those, I used Spotify analytics to find out which countries were listening to pop punk artists the most. For example, Germany and Indonesia are in our top 5 countries, so I made sure to spend extra time researching German and Indonesian rock stations. Then, I checked tour schedules for pop punk artists and found what US states indexed highest amongst the genre. After I had that list, I looked for the top rock-leaning COLLEGE radio stations in those states. Most collegiate stations will have program grids that list what songs/genres they’ve previously played. Spending a few minutes looking for names that match your genre can help you identify who you want to reach out to and who you can skip. A note on radio outreach you’ll want to use Google Drive or Dropbox to host files since most stations will want larger .WAV masters. You’ll ALSO need to include a clean version of your track, specifically with College Radios who try to remain FCC compliant. If you don’t produce your own music, you can easily use Reaper or another DAW to quickly edit curse words out (I’ll use a tape stop on bad words for example). For Social Influencers, our PR Agency had a roster they like to work with. On our end, I just reach out to my pals that have some pull and let them know we dropped a track. Whether they promote that or not is on their own accord. If there is an influencer I really want to hear our track, I’ll DM them and then comment on a recent post to check their DMs. It’s a lil intrusive but part of the game so I don’t think anyone gets too annoyed so long as you’re nice. With Podcasts, I’ll only reach out to shows I’ve listened to before. That way I understand how to prep for the convo and have background on the hosts. An underappreciated aspect of going through the PR process is that at the very least, you’ll be introducing your brand and content to folks who are considered tastemakers. So while our first go here might not yield too much success, our name should become more familiar to influencers in the scene which hopefully can compound down the line. SOCIAL CONTENT From a social media standpoint, I’m good enough with DaVinci Resolve, on-screen text relevant to your brand that preps the viewer to watch your video, and a caption to engage them to comment. I’m admittedly not great at this but try to keep it in mind. PLAYLIST PITCHING Playlist pitching is a double-edged sword. If you’re in a specific genre like we are (pop punk), it’s a bit easier to find relevant playlists. If you’re in a broad genre like pop or rap, you’re going to have a really hard time getting playlist success without paying/getting botted. Just how it seems to be. For us, we used 5 tools for our playlist database Submithub, so I understand why so many folks complain about not having success on this service. It works decently enough for us. Groover I’ve never used before but saw u/MakePopMusic say he liked it. I checked through the service for pop-punk playlists that would push the needle for us and found 5 that I wanted to pitch to. That ended up costing me like \~$20 for this single, so not too much. Will report back how this works. Dailyplaylist is free which I love (we also curate a playlist here). I’ve seen a minor streaming jump on some playlists, nothing crazy though. At the very least with 20 free submissions a week, I’ve seen a few extra hundred listeners after using the site for a month or two. Playlistsupply is a scraper for Spotify data.

All said and done, I’ll collect about 80-100 extra contacts to email day-of release with a pitch. Playlistsupply is $20 a month and I’ll cancel the first month after collecting what I need to collect. This is the first time I’m seriously using Playlistsupply and will report back, but so far 100% of my responses have asked for pay-to-place so the experience isn’t great at this point. (I’ve read enough about all the different playlisting sites and these really are the only four I’ll bother with.)

producer means certain changes will happen in the moment (and be prepared to be open to those), but you don’t want to waste time on layups like melodies, lyrics, strumming patterns, who plays what, etc. caveating this doesn’t mean much if you truly can self-produce a record at a high-quality level. we unfortunately can’t do that lol. once tracking and mixing was complete, we shot the ep off to our mastering house at rogue planet mastering voices onto the tracks, which provides more texture 3. it helps other artists as they get a fully-produced track to hop on – this is free high quality content creation without any cost beyond slightly associating themselves with us. 4. it alerts fanbases and streaming algorithms who is part of which scene. this helps serve your songs to your target community with more accuracy. 5. it gives you a partner when marketing the track (features aren’t required to promote, but most will help introduce you to their followers/fans so long as you aren’t a dick) overall, if a collab is a fit, it’s a real win-win for everyone involved. we found a feature for every track on this ep through different means. some were via introductions from folks we’ve met in the music industry. some were cold-calls via instagram. and others were found right here on reddit in r/popunkers. only one feature requested payment (everyone else was open to the exposure/free content), so we spent $300 in total from a feature standpoint. prerelease prep we pitched our first single “one more shot” to spotify a bit over a month in advance of our release date. at the very least, folks recommend pitching 4 weeks ahead of your release date so metadata can be ingested into spotify and internal playlist curators can review the track for placement. we’ve never been on an editorial playlist yet, but see below for our playlist pitch *nyc's shower beers recruit sydney au heavyweights soso for an intl. pop punk riff-fest. monster gang-vocal chorus (050) gives way to mile-a-minute verse (118) that jumps from easycore to ska with total abandon ( a the sopranos sample for fun). prod. by hidden in plain view's rob freeman (cobra starship/gym class heroes) & mastered by grammy-nominated mike kalajian, would fit on pop punk's not dead or skatepark punks. promo includes a press/ad campaign via don't blink mgmt  a full featured ep* we hit multiple points here in 500 characters the areas we’re both from, that the track is a collab, our genre is pop punk, timestamps on relevant high points in the track for review, a few stylistic points to raise intrigue, namedropping who produced/mastered the track  their previous work to establish credibility, what specific playlists we’d like to be on, and how we’re promoting the track (and by so doing promote spotify). you want your pitch to quickly explain who you are, why the track is worth listening to, and where you belong. take as much guesswork away from a curator – they listen to so much music they don’t have more than a few seconds to give you. amazon music also allows you to pitch songs prerelease – we used much of the same as above although they will allow you more characters. now that the track was pitched, we had about 5 weeks to prepare for how we were going to promote this. below are what we felt were the tools at our disposal • social media content (ig/tiktok for the most part, followed by reddit/threads/twitter/youtube) • instagram ads • publisher/blog outreach • radio outreach • user-generated playlist pitching • podcast outreach • email marketing pr i partnered with don’t blink management so yeah, it’s a lot of work for a \~6% hit rate. folks will debate the benefit of pr and radio in today’s music landscape, but pretty much i think it’s fun to see stuff get published or aired about our band. and end of the day, you do music because it’s fun, so i think it’s worth it. i’m not going to give every pr template i have (you’ll change your message based on publisher/radio/podcasts), but below is what we wrote in regards to publishers (with relevant links removed) **subject pr 11/9 release nyc pop punk band shower beers big-riff single** *tldr - shower beers is dropping ""one more shot"" (the debut single off our new ep featuring australian heavyweights soso) on 11/9 and hope \pubname\ would be interested in covering the track.* *hi \name\,* *i'm

freeman (gym class heroes, cobra starship, hidden in plain view), ""one more shot"" is the debut single off our 2nd ep ""miracle on 34th & 3rd."" we teamed up with the saucy lads in soso from sydney, australia to create what we feel is an international smash. idobi radio once referred to our music as ""an uppercut with brass knuckles"" - we hope \name\ will agree.* *feel free to reach out to me at this email if you have questions or need any more information. i've included our official press release via don't blink management here and our epk here.* *thank you for your consideration!* the subject line clearly defines what the email is about (calling out location and genre). i add a tldr at the top so editors don’t have to read too much before determining if this request is in their wheelhouse (you should only be reaching out to folks in your genre regardless). i try to be personal by finding editor names if i can and providing mine. i’m not attaching mp3 files but using streaming/download links – it’s rude to fill someone’s inbox storage with files. again, i’m providing credibility with our producer’s namedrop and a link to a previous article written about us by a publisher in the scene (idobi radio). i end with our press release and epk so editors should have everything needed to produce content. the easiest way to find publishers is to be knowledgeable in your community. i read a good amount of the sites i reach out to. but in some cases, the 2nd easiest thing to do is google artists that are a bit more popular than you are and see who is writing about them. this way you’ll quickly put together a pr database in your genre. with radio, it was much of the same as above. first i listed all radio stations in our genre i knew of. then, i googled our genres  radio (pop punk radio, punk rock radio, easycore radio, etc). once i scraped those, i used spotify analytics to find out which countries were listening to pop punk artists the most. for example, germany and indonesia are in our top 5 countries, so i made sure to spend extra time researching german and indonesian rock stations. then, i checked tour schedules for pop punk artists and found what us states indexed highest amongst the genre. after i had that list, i looked for the top rock-leaning college radio stations in those states. most collegiate stations will have program grids that list what songs/genres they’ve previously played. spending a few minutes looking for names that match your genre can help you identify who you want to reach out to and who you can skip. a note on radio outreach you’ll want to use google drive or dropbox to host files since most stations will want larger .wav masters. you’ll also need to include a clean version of your track, specifically with college radios who try to remain fcc compliant. if you don’t produce your own music, you can easily use reaper or another daw to quickly edit curse words out (i’ll use a tape stop on bad words for example). for social influencers, our pr agency had a roster they like to work with. on our end, i just reach out to my pals that have some pull and let them know we dropped a track. whether they promote that or not is on their own accord. if there is an influencer i really want to hear our track, i’ll dm them and then comment on a recent post to check their dms. it’s a lil intrusive but part of the game so i don’t think anyone gets too annoyed so long as you’re nice. with podcasts, i’ll only reach out to shows i’ve listened to before. that way i understand how to prep for the convo and have background on the hosts. an underappreciated aspect of going through the pr process is that at the very least, you’ll be introducing your brand and content to folks who are considered tastemakers. so while our first go here might not yield too much success, our name should become more familiar to influencers in the scene which hopefully can compound down the line. social content from a social media standpoint, i’m good enough with davinci resolve, on-screen text relevant to your brand that preps the viewer to watch your video, and a caption to engage them to comment. i’m admittedly not great at this but try to keep it in mind. playlist pitching playlist pitching is a double-edged sword. if you’re in a specific genre like we are (pop punk), it’s a bit easier to find relevant playlists. if you’re in a broad genre like pop or rap, you’re going to have a really hard time getting playlist success without paying/getting botted. just how it seems to be. for us, we used 5 tools for our playlist database submithub, so i understand why so many folks complain about not having success on this service. it works decently enough for us. groover i’ve never used before but saw u/makepopmusic say he liked it. i checked through the service for pop-punk playlists that would push the needle for us and found 5 that i wanted to pitch to. that ended up costing me like \~$20 for this single, so not too much. will report back how this works. dailyplaylist is free which i love (we also curate a playlist here). i’ve seen a minor streaming jump on some playlists, nothing crazy though. at the very least with 20 free submissions a week, i’ve seen a few extra hundred listeners after using the site for a month or two. playlistsupply is a scraper for spotify data. it will return playlist follower size and relevant contact info if available like email or social. i’ll start by searching our genre (pop punk, punk, emo, alternative, indie rock, rock, metal, metalcore, easycore, breakdown, etc), then larger similar artists (blink-182, sum 41, simple plan, beartooth, state champs, etc), then moods (workout, drinking, party, pregame, lifting, racing, etc). all said and done, i’ll collect about 80-100 extra contacts to email day-of release with a pitch. playlistsupply is $20 a month and i’ll cancel the first month after collecting what i need to collect. this is the first time i’m seriously using playlistsupply and will report back, but so far 100% of my responses have asked for pay-to-place so the experience isn’t great at this point. (i’ve read enough about all the different playlisting sites and these really are the only four i’ll bother with.) lastly, i’ll go to similar artists on spotify and check their “discovered on” section via desktop. for the most part it’s easy to tell what playlists are spotify generated and what are user-generated. i’ll typically find a few extra emails by clicking the top playlists for artists. will report back on email responses. email marketing we can be better at this. we only collect emails via distrokid’s “presave” function and i feel like the presave wave is dead at this point. fans are too tired to click a link every time we drop a song and allow some third party access to their spotify, so we stopped pushing that. instead we just are asking our followers on instagram to follow us on spotify too. all this to say email is not really a tool we use much yet, but a lot of more established artists do. instagram ads our strategy is very specific here. i’ll only buy instagram story ads (no facebook ads due to high bot traffic, no ig reels because i just don’t like them). from here, i’ll make 3-4 pieces of very colorful, engaging creative with lyrics from different hooks in our song with a message to “swipe up for spotify.” you can probably find an example on our socials of one of the lyric videos that’ll look a bit like the ad we use. from a targeting standpoint, i’ll run 3 separate ad set tiers based on cities. tier 1 “cities” are just the us, uk, and australia. tier 2 cities are music hotspots in pop-punk/our spotify analytics. this will include canadian, brazilian, mexican, german, and italian cities plus whatever other cities are jumping out in our song-specific analytics. lastly i’ll run tier 3 cities solely to metros in indonesia and the philippines. these countries have the lowest cpms of most other cities i want to run in with a huge amount of interest in rock music. i’ll actually allocate a large % of our daily spend to indonesia and the philippines because they’re awesome and i would love to tour there lol. once geo is set, i’ll age-target to 18-44 or 49 (depending on the audience size). we’ll also “interest target” with an “and” statement. one portion of the target will just be “spotify”, while the other will be bands, genres, and events we’re similar to (all time low, pop punk, warped tour, etc). this tells meta to find fans who use spotify and also are fans of our genre. folks like andrew southward 3. i’ll send an email blast to our presave email list asking them to listen and share the song on socials. easy message, keep it light. 4. i’ll update all our websites – our link in bio, upload a visualizer to our youtube channel, upload files to soundcloud and bandcamp, submit the track to pandora amp’d, etc. 5. i’ll playlist pitch to submithub, then dailyplaylist, then groover 6. i’ll submit the track to be ingested by musixmatch so our lyrics can be tracked on socials/in spotify 7. i’ll add our lyrics to genius 8. i’ll email all the user-generated playlist emails i scrapped from spotify/playlistsupply with a pitch 9. i’ll begin following up with every publisher/radio station/podcast over email with the spotify link letting them know our song is out and seeing if they were still interested in covering the release 10. from here it’s probably 3am so i’ll climb into bed and pass out 11. i’ll try to be up at 9am so i can post our youtube visualizer to appropriate reddit communities 12. i’ll post a release announcement to tiktok at this time as well 13. instagram, twitter, and threads i’ll wait until about 10am to post on main 14. i’m also part of a few facebook groups – i typically never post on facebook but might give it a shot this time around 15. i’ve also put together some funny flyers i’ll hang up around nyc just for sh!ts and giggles from there, i’m slogging through a content push over our socials for the next few weeks until it’s time to do it all over again with the next track (since we’re pop punk, we’ll most likely wait until feb/away from the holidays). i’ll also use this downtime to start tracking demos for our next ep since being in the music cycle is a never-ending hamster wheel that forces you to continuously move until you fall off or die. total cost if we’re estimating/fudging costs from start to finish (again some of these aren’t the actual costs of my studio/pr), i’m spending about creating the ep $4,000 features $300 pr $600 playlisting $85 ads $120 total $5,105 is it worth it? our band has about 100k streams total after existing for a year, with our top track at 36k streams. we peaked at 10k monthly listeners back when we dropped our acoustic track in may but average around 2k monthlies when not releasing music. so is dropping \~$5,105 on recording an ep and promoting a single to an audience this size worth it? end of the day, we created something cool and it was heard by others (and sometimes even enjoyed). a few times i’ve met strangers in public at shows and they mentioned how much they liked our band. it continuously provides me with a sense of purpose. so yeah, while it’s a bit pricey, i think it’s worth it. now if someone wanted to do music for a career, this whole scenario becomes a lot more stressful. this is a ton of work for very little monetary upside. i wouldn’t envy someone who’s attempting this without major backing and a comical amount of talent. what can we do better? i know a few areas i’ve self-critiqued if i wanted to get better at this whole thing • we don’t really play too many shows yet (it’s a lot of money and logistics to tour). we’re looking to start opening for folks in the nyc area to get started • i should accept my fate and start producing more personalized social content (get in front of the camera and dance my little dance) • i can spend more times in niche social platforms like discords, twitch streams, and yt shorts • i can learn/operate instagram advertising more efficiently via conversion pixels and a/b testing • we should start selling merch for additional income and roll that shop into email collection • spend time creating and managing a vehicle for more organic content (whether that be managing my own music blog, starting a podcast, etc) if we’re being honest, i’m probably not going to try any of the above anytime soon because our current promotion efforts take so much time away from what i really enjoy, which is writing and recording music. but i do find fulfillment in being heard, so this all does feel a bit necessary. hopefully this 8 page rundown helps a musician in the future plan for their release. being a successful musician today is pretty much an exercise in being a full-time brand manager. to summarize, you’ve gotta ensure your music is professional in all aspects, take the pitching process seriously, learn advertising, pr, and content creation, and try to remember that music is fun. hope you liked it, thanks. chris/shower beers   ",16,3596
17rdehs,1699537956.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,ShowerBeersMusic,SONG RELEASE PLAN: This Is How an Indie Pop Punk Band Promotes New Music in 2023,"Hey. We just went through the process of releasing a new song, and during that time I utilized a ton of random reddit threads along with what I already knew about the music marketing process. I compiled EVERYTHING we did for a single song release in this (long) post with the hopes it might help someone down the line – hopefully consolidating it all is useful. I’ve also included cost breakdowns where appropriate (I’m not giving rates to our partners that aren’t publicly advertising pricing cause I think that’s rude). Gonna preface that I don’t really have any idea what I’m doing, so who knows what’s good advice and what isn’t here. Buckle up.

  
BACKGROUND: we’re a very independent pop punk band. This means a few things:

1.	We have a somewhat niche genre and audience target. This is important, as it allows us to dig in deeper with our research and community than if we were a standard pop, rap, EDM, or even country artist. Some of the below that works for us won’t work for more saturated genres.  
2.	We don’t have the financial backing or professional connections a label would provide, so all marketing is either DIY or out of our own pockets. Also no manager/mentor, so really winging it and seeing what sticks.  
3.	Because we make rock music, it takes a bit longer to write and record songs compared to a pop singer or rapper who can just hop on a beat via any number of producers. So the “release a song every week” advice is a bit tougher for us to do. On that note, you gotta make a bigger deal when you DO drop music since it’s less frequent.

  
RECORDING PROCESS  
This is where a successful marketing campaign must start. If your song sucks from a songwriting/production standpoint, it SHOULDN’T matter how much you advertise. Unless you’re a plant or marketing genius, it’s prob not going to work out.  
We found a studio that’s worked with professional artists in our genre ([Audio Pilot Studios](https://www.audiopilotproduction.com/) in NJ). For a 4 song EP, I wrote around 20 songs, demoed 14, and settled on 4. This is important because we’re not walking into the studio “waiting for inspiration strike” or “seeing how the energy goes.” It is very chill if you have enough capital to spend time writing in-studio. Studios are creative spaces and I’m sure that’s an awesome experience. But since we’re bankrolling the session ourselves, I always want to walk in with the songs as close to complete as possible. Obviously working with a producer means certain changes will happen in the moment (and be prepared to be open to those), but you don’t want to waste time on layups like melodies, lyrics, strumming patterns, who plays what, etc. Caveating this doesn’t mean much if you truly can self-produce a record at a high-quality level. We unfortunately can’t do that LOL.  
Once tracking and mixing was complete, we shot the EP off to our mastering house at [Rogue Planet Mastering](https://www.rogueplanetmastering.com/). I’m a big believer in a real mastering engineer being able to take your track from 90% to 100% - it gets you that much closer to a high quality record.  
I’m not going to break out all of the costs for the recording process specific to our experience, but a decent rule of thumb is you could expect $1k a song all-in, so let’s say \~$4,000 for this exercise. Obviously that can be less if you’re efficient, and way more if you stink and are being charged by the hour. These costs can balloon quickly if you’re not efficient.

  
COLLABORATION  
I am a huge fan of partnering with artists on tracks. It’s more important now than ever for a few reasons.  
1.	It gives me a chance to hang and chat with artists I like  
2.	It brings new (and better?) voices onto the tracks, which provides more texture  
3.	It helps other artists as they get a fully-produced track to hop on – this is free high quality content creation without any cost beyond slightly associating themselves with us.  
4.	It alerts fanbases AND streaming algorithms who is part of which scene. This helps serve your songs to your target community with more accuracy.  
5.	It gives you a partner when marketing the track (features aren’t required to promote, but most will help introduce you to their followers/fans so long as you aren’t a dick)  
Overall, if a collab is a fit, it’s a real win-win for everyone involved. We found a feature for every track on this EP through different means. Some were via introductions from folks we’ve met in the music industry. Some were cold-calls via Instagram. And others were found right here on reddit in r/popunkers. Only one feature requested payment (everyone else was open to the exposure/free content), so we spent $300 in total from a feature standpoint. 

  
PRERELEASE PREP  
We pitched our first single “One More Shot” to Spotify a bit over a month in advance of our release date. At the very least, folks recommend pitching 4 weeks ahead of your release date so metadata can be ingested into Spotify and internal playlist curators can review the track for placement. We’ve never been on an editorial playlist yet, but see below for our playlist pitch:

  
*NYC's Shower Beers recruit Sydney AU heavyweights SoSo for an intl. pop punk riff-fest. Monster gang-vocal chorus (0:50) gives way to mile-a-minute verse (1:18) that jumps from easycore to ska with total abandon (+ a The Sopranos sample for fun). Prod. by Hidden In Plain View's Rob Freeman (Cobra Starship/Gym Class Heroes) &amp; mastered by Grammy-nominated Mike Kalajian, would fit on Pop Punk's Not Dead or Skatepark Punks. Promo includes a press/ad campaign via Don't Blink Mgmt + a full featured EP*

  
We hit multiple points here in 500 characters: the areas we’re BOTH from, that the track is a collab, our genre is pop punk, timestamps on relevant high points in the track for review, a few stylistic points to raise intrigue, namedropping who produced/mastered the track + their previous work to establish credibility, what specific playlists we’d like to be on, and how we’re promoting the track (and by so doing promote Spotify). You want your pitch to quickly explain who you are, why the track is worth listening to, and where you belong. Take as much guesswork away from a curator – they listen to so much music they don’t have more than a few seconds to give you. Amazon Music also allows you to pitch songs prerelease – we used much of the same as above although they will allow you more characters.  
Now that the track was pitched, we had about 5 weeks to prepare for how we were going to promote this. Below are what we felt were the tools at our disposal:  
•	Social Media Content (IG/TikTok for the most part, followed by Reddit/Threads/Twitter/Youtube)  
•	Instagram Ads  
•	Publisher/Blog Outreach  
•	Radio Outreach  
•	User-Generated Playlist Pitching  
•	Podcast Outreach  
•	Email Marketing

  
PR  
I partnered with [Don’t Blink Management](https://www.dontblinkmg.com/) so we could utilize their established connections to gain a foothold with more popular publishers. I won’t give DBM’s specific rates. But we reached out to about 5 PR agencies and the average quoted cost was around $300-$1,000 for an independent band’s PR depending on what you want, so for this exercise let’s rock with $600. Between the two of us, we ended up contacting around the below:

  
MEDIA TYPE	EMAILS SENT APPROVALS  
Publisher/Blog     163	             14  
Radio	               160	               4  
Podcast	                 20	               3  
Social Influencer\* 19	               2

\*we’ll continue reaching out to social influencers now that the track is out, as it’s easier to pitch when the song is in IG/TikTok libraries (also I'm having a hard time with tables on reddit so hopefully this makes sense)

  
So yeah, it’s a lot of work for a \~6% hit rate. Folks will debate the benefit of PR and Radio in today’s music landscape, but pretty much I think it’s fun to see stuff get published or aired about our band. And end of the day, you do music because it’s fun, so I think it’s worth it.  
I’m not going to give every PR template I have (you’ll change your message based on publisher/radio/podcasts), but below is what we wrote in regards to publishers (with relevant links removed):

  
**SUBJECT: PR 11/9 Release: NYC Pop Punk Band Shower Beers Big-Riff Single**  
*TL:DR - Shower Beers is dropping ""One More Shot"" (the debut single off our new EP featuring Australian heavyweights SoSo) on 11/9 and hope \[PUBNAME\] would be interested in covering the track.*   
*Hi \[NAME\],*  
*I'm \[YOURNAME\] from the NYC-based pop punk band Shower Beers. I'm reaching out as I noticed you've covered some pop-punk acts in the past \[EXAMPLE HERE\] - we were hoping \[NAME\] would consider covering our new single ""One More Shot"" on or after our November 9th release.*  
*Streaming and download available at the private Soundcloud link below:*  
*PREVIEWLINK*  
*Produced at Audio Pilot Studios by Rob Freeman (Gym Class Heroes, Cobra Starship, Hidden In Plain View), ""One More Shot"" is the debut single off our 2nd EP ""Miracle on 34th &amp; 3rd."" We teamed up with the saucy lads in SoSo from Sydney, Australia to create what we feel is an international smash. Idobi Radio once referred to our music as ""an uppercut with brass knuckles"" - we hope \[NAME\] will agree.*  
*Feel free to reach out to me at this email if you have questions or need any more information. I've included our official press release via Don't Blink Management HERE and our EPK HERE.*  
*Thank you for your consideration!*

  
The subject line clearly defines what the email is about (calling out location and genre). I add a TL:DR at the top so editors don’t have to read too much before determining if this request is in their wheelhouse (you should only be reaching out to folks in your genre regardless). I try to be personal by finding editor names if I can and providing mine. I’m NOT attaching MP3 files but using streaming/download links – it’s rude to fill someone’s inbox storage with files. Again, I’m providing credibility with our producer’s namedrop AND a link to a previous article written about us by a publisher in the scene (Idobi Radio). I end with our Press Release and EPK so editors should have everything needed to produce content.  
The easiest way to find publishers is to be knowledgeable in your community. I read a good amount of the sites I reach out to. But in some cases, the 2nd easiest thing to do is Google artists that are a bit more popular than you are and see who is writing about them. This way you’ll quickly put together a PR database in your genre.  
With Radio, it was much of the same as above. First I listed all radio stations in our genre I knew of. Then, I googled our genres + radio (pop punk radio, punk rock radio, easycore radio, etc). Once I scraped those, I used Spotify analytics to find out which countries were listening to pop punk artists the most. For example, Germany and Indonesia are in our top 5 countries, so I made sure to spend extra time researching German and Indonesian rock stations. Then, I checked tour schedules for pop punk artists and found what US states indexed highest amongst the genre. After I had that list, I looked for the top rock-leaning COLLEGE radio stations in those states. Most collegiate stations will have program grids that list what songs/genres they’ve previously played. Spending a few minutes looking for names that match your genre can help you identify who you want to reach out to and who you can skip.   
A note on radio outreach: you’ll want to use Google Drive or Dropbox to host files since most stations will want larger .WAV masters. You’ll ALSO need to include a clean version of your track, specifically with College Radios who try to remain FCC compliant. If you don’t produce your own music, you can easily use Reaper or another DAW to quickly edit curse words out (I’ll use a tape stop on bad words for example).   
For Social Influencers, our PR Agency had a roster they like to work with. On our end, I just reach out to my pals that have some pull and let them know we dropped a track. Whether they promote that or not is on their own accord. If there is an influencer I really want to hear our track, I’ll DM them and then comment on a recent post to check their DMs. It’s a lil intrusive but part of the game so I don’t think anyone gets too annoyed so long as you’re nice.  
With Podcasts, I’ll only reach out to shows I’ve listened to before. That way I understand how to prep for the convo and have background on the hosts.   
An underappreciated aspect of going through the PR process is that at the very least, you’ll be introducing your brand and content to folks who are considered tastemakers. So while our first go here might not yield too much success, our name should become more familiar to influencers in the scene which hopefully can compound down the line. 

  
SOCIAL CONTENT  
From a social media standpoint, I’m good enough with [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) and [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/) to edit together stupid social content. Both systems are free and can be learned via some time on Youtube. As of writing this, I’ve made 50 pieces of SFV content that can be posted to support the track. I’ll probably end up with 60-70 posts. On Instagram I focus on more comedic/skit content using our music. TikTok is more engineered for spamming discoverable content, so I’ll focus on clips like lyric videos. This is personal, but I don’t like the cute TikToks of singing to a camera or whatever. I just don’t wanna do it. That probably hurts us, but I work hard to put out different content that I HOPE differentiates a bit from the thousands of musicians on social media filming in their backyards or bedrooms. I’m probably wrong here, but it is what it is, I don’t wanna lipsync in the bathroom.  
I’ll also use social media to stay in contact with other artists/individuals I like in the scene. Give your pals engagement on socials, it only helps their posts.   
On TikTok in particular, I’ll look at what similar artists who are having success are using as captions, hashtags, and on-screen text. The way I look at it is you use hashtags to inform the algorithm who to start serving to at first (fans of your micro-genre), on-screen text relevant to your brand that preps the viewer to watch your video, and a caption to engage them to comment. I’m admittedly not great at this but try to keep it in mind.

  
PLAYLIST PITCHING  
Playlist pitching is a double-edged sword. If you’re in a specific genre like we are (pop punk), it’s a bit easier to find relevant playlists. If you’re in a broad genre like pop or rap, you’re going to have a really hard time getting playlist success without paying/getting botted. Just how it seems to be.  
For us, we used 5 tools for our playlist database: [Submithub](https://www.submithub.com/), [Groover](https://groover.co/en/), [Dailyplaylists](https://dailyplaylists.com/), [Playlistsupply](https://playlistsupply.com/), and Spotify’s “Discovered On” section.

  
Submithub works for us because they have a lot of pop-punk specific playlists curated by individuals who like our band. We’ll see on average a 30% success rate with about 40 credits used per track. That comes out to $45 spent for 3,000-4,000 extra listeners and 5,500ish streams all-time, so not too bad. Again, our music is studio quality and we know our genre (which can’t be said for some other artists), so I understand why so many folks complain about not having success on this service. It works decently enough for us.  
Groover I’ve never used before but saw u/MakePopMusic say he liked it. I checked through the service for pop-punk playlists that would push the needle for us and found 5 that I wanted to pitch to. That ended up costing me like \~$20 for this single, so not too much. Will report back how this works.  
Dailyplaylist is free which I love (we also curate a playlist here). I’ve seen a minor streaming jump on some playlists, nothing crazy though. At the very least with 20 free submissions a week, I’ve seen a few extra hundred listeners after using the site for a month or two.  
Playlistsupply is a scraper for Spotify data. It will return playlist follower size and relevant contact info if available like email or social. I’ll start by searching our genre (Pop Punk, Punk, Emo, Alternative, Indie Rock, Rock, Metal, Metalcore, Easycore, Breakdown, etc), then larger similar artists (blink-182, Sum 41, Simple Plan, Beartooth, State Champs, etc), then MOODS (workout, drinking, party, pregame, lifting, racing, etc). All said and done, I’ll collect about 80-100 extra contacts to email day-of release with a pitch. Playlistsupply is $20 a month and I’ll cancel the first month after collecting what I need to collect. This is the first time I’m seriously using Playlistsupply and will report back, but so far 100% of my responses have asked for pay-to-place so the experience isn’t great at this point. (I’ve read enough about all the different playlisting sites and these really are the only four I’ll bother with.)

  
Lastly, I’ll go to similar artists on Spotify and check their “Discovered On” section via desktop. For the most part it’s easy to tell what playlists are Spotify generated and what are user-generated. I’ll typically find a few extra emails by clicking the top playlists for artists. Will report back on email responses.

  
EMAIL MARKETING  
We can be better at this. We only collect emails via Distrokid’s “presave” function and I feel like the presave wave is dead at this point. Fans are too tired to click a link every time we drop a song and allow some third party access to their Spotify, so we stopped pushing that. Instead we just are asking our followers on Instagram to follow us on Spotify too. All this to say email is not really a tool we use much yet, but a lot of more established artists do.

  
INSTAGRAM ADS  
Our strategy is very specific here. I’ll only buy Instagram story ads (no Facebook ads due to high bot traffic, no IG reels because I just don’t like them). From here, I’ll make 3-4 pieces of very colorful, engaging creative with lyrics from different hooks in our song with a message to “swipe up for Spotify.” You can probably find an example on our socials of one of the lyric videos that’ll look a bit like the ad we use.  
From a targeting standpoint, I’ll run 3 separate ad set tiers based on cities. Tier 1 “cities” are just the US, UK, and Australia. Tier 2 cities are music hotspots in pop-punk/our Spotify analytics. This will include Canadian, Brazilian, Mexican, German, and Italian cities plus whatever other cities are jumping out in our song-specific analytics. Lastly I’ll run Tier 3 cities solely to metros in Indonesia and the Philippines. These countries have the lowest CPMs of most other cities I want to run in with a HUGE amount of interest in rock music. I’ll actually allocate a large % of our daily spend to Indonesia and the Philippines because they’re awesome and I would love to tour there LOL.   
Once geo is set, I’ll age-target to 18-44 or 49 (depending on the audience size). We’ll also “interest target” with an “AND” statement. One portion of the target will just be “Spotify”, while the other will be bands, genres, and events we’re similar to (All Time Low, Pop Punk, Warped Tour, etc). This tells Meta to find fans who use Spotify AND ALSO are fans of our genre. Folks like [Andrew Southward](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCajL-kaSv6A4-sNoX-U99Qw) will preach fine-tuning this strategy by using A/B testing on specific interest targets and utilizing conversion pixels vs simply optimizing to clickthrough. I get that, but I’m just a man. Eventually we’ll optimize this process but for now the easy way is working for us. I’ll allocate about $4 a day for a month – currently trying $2 to Tier 1, $2 to Tier 3, and $1 to Tier 2. This will result in about a $0.12 cost per click for $120, which will result in about 1,000 new listeners to our page. 

  
DAY OF RELEASE  
About 24-48 hours before launch, I’ll follow up with everyone who agreed to cover our song to see if they need anything else. I’ll also start teasing a track on social 7 days in advance of the release date and ask folks to follow us on Spotify. Week of, I’ll try to drop a small teaser a day – not enough to ruin the surprise but enough to stay engaged. The day prior to dropping I’ll most likely share a piece of content with the chorus/hook. So if we’re dropping a track Thursday, on Monday I’ll post a clip with some ambient filters on the song, Tuesday I’ll highlight a riff, and Wednesday we’ll show the chorus before a midnight Thursday drop.  
I take day-of releasing pretty seriously – I think time is of the essence if you want to get algorithms to notice your new content. So I’ll snag a few Red Bulls, try to nap a bit when I get home from work, and be awake and ready to rock for the midnight drop. Once the song is live, the below is exactly what I’ll do into the early morning:

  
1.	I’ll immediately post on my STORY about the song dropping  
2.	I’ll set our Instagram ads live (as we need the Spotify link for a clickthrough before publishing ads on that platform)  
3.	I’ll send an email blast to our presave email list asking them to listen and share the song on socials. Easy message, keep it light.  
4.	I’ll update all our websites – our link in bio, upload a visualizer to our YouTube channel, upload files to Soundcloud and Bandcamp, submit the track to Pandora Amp’d, etc.  
5.	I’ll playlist pitch to Submithub, then Dailyplaylist, then Groover  
6.	I’ll submit the track to be ingested by Musixmatch so our lyrics can be tracked on socials/in Spotify  
7.	I’ll add our lyrics to Genius  
8.	I’ll email all the user-generated playlist emails I scrapped from Spotify/PlaylistSupply with a pitch  
9.	I’ll begin following up with every publisher/radio station/podcast over email with the Spotify link letting them know our song is out and seeing if they were still interested in covering the release  
10.	From here it’s probably 3AM so I’ll climb into bed and pass out  
11.	I’ll try to be up at 9AM so I can post our Youtube Visualizer to appropriate Reddit communities  
12.	I’ll post a release announcement to TikTok at this time as well  
13.	Instagram, Twitter, and Threads I’ll wait until about 10AM to post on main  
14.	I’m also part of a few Facebook Groups – I typically never post on Facebook but might give it a shot this time around  
15.	I’ve also put together some funny flyers I’ll hang up around NYC just for sh!ts and giggles

  
From there, I’m slogging through a content push over our socials for the next few weeks until it’s time to do it all over again with the next track (since we’re pop punk, we’ll most likely wait until Feb/away from the holidays). I’ll also use this downtime to start tracking demos for our next EP since being in the music cycle is a never-ending hamster wheel that forces you to continuously move until you fall off or die. 

  
TOTAL COST  
If we’re estimating/fudging costs from start to finish (again some of these aren’t the actual costs of my studio/PR), I’m spending about:

  
Creating the EP $4,000  
Features $300  
PR	$600  
Playlisting $85  
Ads	$120  
TOTAL $5,105  
  
IS IT WORTH IT?  
Our band has about 100k streams total after existing for a year, with our top track at 36k streams. We peaked at 10k monthly listeners back when we dropped our acoustic track in May but average around 2k monthlies when not releasing music. So is dropping \~$5,105 on recording an EP and promoting a single to an audience this size worth it? End of the day, we created something cool and it was heard by others (and sometimes even enjoyed). A few times I’ve met strangers in public at shows and they mentioned how much they liked our band. It continuously provides me with a sense of purpose. So yeah, while it’s a bit pricey, I think it’s worth it.  
Now if someone wanted to do music for a career, this whole scenario becomes a lot more stressful. This is a ton of work for very little monetary upside. I wouldn’t envy someone who’s attempting this without major backing and a comical amount of talent.

  
WHAT CAN WE DO BETTER?  
I know a few areas I’ve self-critiqued if I wanted to get better at this whole thing:  
•	We don’t really play too many shows yet (it’s a lot of money and logistics to tour). We’re looking to start opening for folks in the NYC area to get started  
•	I should accept my fate and start producing more personalized social content (get in front of the camera and dance my little dance)  
•	I can spend more times in niche social platforms like Discords, Twitch Streams, and YT Shorts  
•	I can learn/operate Instagram advertising more efficiently via conversion pixels and A/B testing  
•	We should start selling merch for additional income and roll that shop into email collection  
•	Spend time creating and managing a vehicle for more organic content (whether that be managing my own music blog, starting a podcast, etc)

  
If we’re being honest, I’m probably not going to try any of the above anytime soon because our current promotion efforts take so much time away from what I really enjoy, which is writing and recording music. But I do find fulfillment in being heard, so this all does feel a bit necessary.

  
Hopefully this 8 page rundown helps a musician in the future plan for their release. Being a successful musician today is pretty much an exercise in being a full-time brand manager. To summarize, you’ve gotta ensure your music is professional in all aspects, take the pitching process seriously, learn advertising, PR, and content creation, and try to remember that music is fun. Hope you liked it, thanks.

We just went through the process of releasing a new song, and during that time I utilized a ton of random reddit threads along with what I already knew about the music marketing process. I compiled EVERYTHING we did for a single song release in this (long) post with the hopes it might help someone down the line – hopefully consolidating it all is useful. I’ve also included cost breakdowns where appropriate (I’m not giving rates to our partners that aren’t publicly advertising pricing cause I think that’s rude). Gonna preface that I don’t really have any idea what I’m doing, so who knows what’s good advice and what isn’t here. Buckle up.    BACKGROUND we’re a very independent pop punk band. This means a few things 1.	We have a somewhat niche genre and audience target. This is important, as it allows us to dig in deeper with our research and community than if we were a standard pop, rap, EDM, or even country artist. Some of the below that works for us won’t work for more saturated genres.   2.	We don’t have the financial backing or professional connections a label would provide, so all marketing is either DIY or out of our own pockets. Also no manager/mentor, so really winging it and seeing what sticks.   3.	Because we make rock music, it takes a bit longer to write and record songs compared to a pop singer or rapper who can just hop on a beat via any number of producers. So the “release a song every week” advice is a bit tougher for us to do. On that note, you gotta make a bigger deal when you DO drop music since it’s less frequent.    RECORDING PROCESS   This is where a successful marketing campaign must start. If your song sucks from a songwriting/production standpoint, it SHOULDN’T matter how much you advertise. Unless you’re a plant or marketing genius, it’s prob not going to work out.   We found a studio that’s worked with professional artists in our genre (Audio Pilot Studios. For a 4 song EP, I wrote around 20 songs, demoed 14, and settled on 4. This is important because we’re not walking into the studio “waiting for inspiration strike” or “seeing how the energy goes.” It is very chill if you have enough capital to spend time writing in-studio. Studios are creative spaces and I’m sure that’s an awesome experience. But since we’re bankrolling the session ourselves, I always want to walk in with the songs as close to complete as possible. Obviously working with a producer means certain changes will happen in the moment (and be prepared to be open to those), but you don’t want to waste time on layups like melodies, lyrics, strumming patterns, who plays what, etc. Caveating this doesn’t mean much if you truly can self-produce a record at a high-quality level. We unfortunately can’t do that LOL.   Once tracking and mixing was complete, we shot the EP off to our mastering house at Rogue Planet Mastering voices onto the tracks, which provides more texture   3.	It helps other artists as they get a fully-produced track to hop on – this is free high quality content creation without any cost beyond slightly associating themselves with us.   4.	It alerts fanbases AND streaming algorithms who is part of which scene. This helps serve your songs to your target community with more accuracy.   5.	It gives you a partner when marketing the track (features aren’t required to promote, but most will help introduce you to their followers/fans so long as you aren’t a dick)   Overall, if a collab is a fit, it’s a real win-win for everyone involved. We found a feature for every track on this EP through different means. Some were via introductions from folks we’ve met in the music industry. Some were cold-calls via Instagram. And others were found right here on reddit in r/popunkers. Only one feature requested payment (everyone else was open to the exposure/free content), so we spent $300 in total from a feature standpoint.     PRERELEASE PREP   We pitched our first single “One More Shot” to Spotify a bit over a month in advance of our release date. At the very least, folks recommend pitching 4 weeks ahead of your release date so metadata can be ingested into Spotify and internal playlist curators can review the track for placement. We’ve never been on an editorial playlist yet, but see below for our playlist pitch    *NYC's Shower Beers recruit Sydney AU heavyweights SoSo for an intl. pop punk riff-fest. Monster gang-vocal chorus (050) gives way to mile-a-minute verse (118) that jumps from easycore to ska with total abandon ( a The Sopranos sample for fun). Prod. by Hidden In Plain View's Rob Freeman (Cobra Starship/Gym Class Heroes) & mastered by Grammy-nominated Mike Kalajian, would fit on Pop Punk's Not Dead or Skatepark Punks. Promo includes a press/ad campaign via Don't Blink Mgmt  a full featured EP*    We hit multiple points here in 500 characters the areas we’re BOTH from, that the track is a collab, our genre is pop punk, timestamps on relevant high points in the track for review, a few stylistic points to raise intrigue, namedropping who produced/mastered the track  their previous work to establish credibility, what specific playlists we’d like to be on, and how we’re promoting the track (and by so doing promote Spotify). You want your pitch to quickly explain who you are, why the track is worth listening to, and where you belong. Take as much guesswork away from a curator – they listen to so much music they don’t have more than a few seconds to give you. Amazon Music also allows you to pitch songs prerelease – we used much of the same as above although they will allow you more characters.   Now that the track was pitched, we had about 5 weeks to prepare for how we were going to promote this. Below are what we felt were the tools at our disposal   •	Social Media Content (IG/TikTok for the most part, followed by Reddit/Threads/Twitter/Youtube)   •	Instagram Ads   •	Publisher/Blog Outreach   •	Radio Outreach   •	User-Generated Playlist Pitching   •	Podcast Outreach   •	Email Marketing    PR   I partnered with Don’t Blink Management    So yeah, it’s a lot of work for a \~6% hit rate. Folks will debate the benefit of PR and Radio in today’s music landscape, but pretty much I think it’s fun to see stuff get published or aired about our band. And end of the day, you do music because it’s fun, so I think it’s worth it.   I’m not going to give every PR template I have (you’ll change your message based on publisher/radio/podcasts), but below is what we wrote in regards to publishers (with relevant links removed)    **SUBJECT PR 11/9 Release NYC Pop Punk Band Shower Beers Big-Riff Single**   *TLDR - Shower Beers is dropping ""One More Shot"" (the debut single off our new EP featuring Australian heavyweights SoSo) on 11/9 and hope \PUBNAME\ would be interested in covering the track.*    *Hi \NAME\,*   *I'm \YOURNAME\ from the NYC-based pop punk band Shower Beers. I'm reaching out as I noticed you've covered some pop-punk acts in the past \EXAMPLE HERE\ - we were hoping \NAME\ would consider covering our new single ""One More Shot"" on or after our November 9th release.*   *Streaming and download available at the private Soundcloud link below*   *PREVIEWLINK*   *Produced at Audio Pilot Studios by Rob Freeman (Gym Class Heroes, Cobra Starship, Hidden In Plain View), ""One More Shot"" is the debut single off our 2nd EP ""Miracle on 34th & 3rd."" We teamed up with the saucy lads in SoSo from Sydney, Australia to create what we feel is an international smash. Idobi Radio once referred to our music as ""an uppercut with brass knuckles"" - we hope \NAME\ will agree.*   *Feel free to reach out to me at this email if you have questions or need any more information. I've included our official press release via Don't Blink Management HERE and our EPK HERE.*   *Thank you for your consideration!*    The subject line clearly defines what the email is about (calling out location and genre). I add a TLDR at the top so editors don’t have to read too much before determining if this request is in their wheelhouse (you should only be reaching out to folks in your genre regardless). I try to be personal by finding editor names if I can and providing mine. I’m NOT attaching MP3 files but using streaming/download links – it’s rude to fill someone’s inbox storage with files. Again, I’m providing credibility with our producer’s namedrop AND a link to a previous article written about us by a publisher in the scene (Idobi Radio). I end with our Press Release and EPK so editors should have everything needed to produce content.   The easiest way to find publishers is to be knowledgeable in your community. I read a good amount of the sites I reach out to. But in some cases, the 2nd easiest thing to do is Google artists that are a bit more popular than you are and see who is writing about them. This way you’ll quickly put together a PR database in your genre.   With Radio, it was much of the same as above. First I listed all radio stations in our genre I knew of. Then, I googled our genres  radio (pop punk radio, punk rock radio, easycore radio, etc). Once I scraped those, I used Spotify analytics to find out which countries were listening to pop punk artists the most. For example, Germany and Indonesia are in our top 5 countries, so I made sure to spend extra time researching German and Indonesian rock stations. Then, I checked tour schedules for pop punk artists and found what US states indexed highest amongst the genre. After I had that list, I looked for the top rock-leaning COLLEGE radio stations in those states. Most collegiate stations will have program grids that list what songs/genres they’ve previously played. Spending a few minutes looking for names that match your genre can help you identify who you want to reach out to and who you can skip.    A note on radio outreach you’ll want to use Google Drive or Dropbox to host files since most stations will want larger .WAV masters. You’ll ALSO need to include a clean version of your track, specifically with College Radios who try to remain FCC compliant. If you don’t produce your own music, you can easily use Reaper or another DAW to quickly edit curse words out (I’ll use a tape stop on bad words for example).    For Social Influencers, our PR Agency had a roster they like to work with. On our end, I just reach out to my pals that have some pull and let them know we dropped a track. Whether they promote that or not is on their own accord. If there is an influencer I really want to hear our track, I’ll DM them and then comment on a recent post to check their DMs. It’s a lil intrusive but part of the game so I don’t think anyone gets too annoyed so long as you’re nice.   With Podcasts, I’ll only reach out to shows I’ve listened to before. That way I understand how to prep for the convo and have background on the hosts.    An underappreciated aspect of going through the PR process is that at the very least, you’ll be introducing your brand and content to folks who are considered tastemakers. So while our first go here might not yield too much success, our name should become more familiar to influencers in the scene which hopefully can compound down the line.     SOCIAL CONTENT   From a social media standpoint, I’m good enough with DaVinci Resolve, on-screen text relevant to your brand that preps the viewer to watch your video, and a caption to engage them to comment. I’m admittedly not great at this but try to keep it in mind.    PLAYLIST PITCHING   Playlist pitching is a double-edged sword. If you’re in a specific genre like we are (pop punk), it’s a bit easier to find relevant playlists.

All said and done, I’ll collect about 80-100 extra contacts to email day-of release with a pitch. Playlistsupply is $20 a month and I’ll cancel the first month after collecting what I need to collect. This is the first time I’m seriously using Playlistsupply and will report back, but so far 100% of my responses have asked for pay-to-place so the experience isn’t great at this point.

We’re looking to start opening for folks in the NYC area to get started   •	I should accept my fate and start producing more personalized social content (get in front of the camera and dance my little dance)   •	I can spend more times in niche social platforms like Discords, Twitch Streams, and YT Shorts   •	I can learn/operate Instagram advertising more efficiently via conversion pixels and A/B testing   •	We should start selling merch for additional income and roll that shop into email collection   •	Spend time creating and managing a vehicle for more organic content (whether that be managing my own music blog, starting a podcast, etc)    If we’re being honest, I’m probably not going to try any of the above anytime soon because our current promotion efforts take so much time away from what I really enjoy, which is writing and recording music. But I do find fulfillment in being heard, so this all does feel a bit necessary.    Hopefully this 8 page rundown helps a musician in the future plan for their release. Being a successful musician today is pretty much an exercise in being a full-time brand manager. To summarize, you’ve gotta ensure your music is professional in all aspects, take the pitching process seriously, learn advertising, PR, and content creation, and try to remember that music is fun. Hope you liked it, thanks.    Chris/Shower Beers   ","hey. we just went through the process of releasing a new song, and during that time i utilized a ton of random reddit threads along with what i already knew about the music marketing process. i compiled everything we did for a single song release in this (long) post with the hopes it might help someone down the line – hopefully consolidating it all is useful. i’ve also included cost breakdowns where appropriate (i’m not giving rates to our partners that aren’t publicly advertising pricing cause i think that’s rude). gonna preface that i don’t really have any idea what i’m doing, so who knows what’s good advice and what isn’t here. buckle up.    background we’re a very independent pop punk band. this means a few things 1.	we have a somewhat niche genre and audience target. this is important, as it allows us to dig in deeper with our research and community than if we were a standard pop, rap, edm, or even country artist. some of the below that works for us won’t work for more saturated genres.   2.	we don’t have the financial backing or professional connections a label would provide, so all marketing is either diy or out of our own pockets. also no manager/mentor, so really winging it and seeing what sticks.   3.	because we make rock music, it takes a bit longer to write and record songs compared to a pop singer or rapper who can just hop on a beat via any number of producers. so the “release a song every week” advice is a bit tougher for us to do. on that note, you gotta make a bigger deal when you do drop music since it’s less frequent.    recording process   this is where a successful marketing campaign must start. if your song sucks from a songwriting/production standpoint, it shouldn’t matter how much you advertise. unless you’re a plant or marketing genius, it’s prob not going to work out.   we found a studio that’s worked with professional artists in our genre (audio pilot studios. for a 4 song ep, i wrote around 20 songs, demoed 14, and settled on 4. this is important because we’re not walking into the studio “waiting for inspiration strike” or “seeing how the energy goes.” it is very chill if you have enough capital to spend time writing in-studio. studios are creative spaces and i’m sure that’s an awesome experience. but since we’re bankrolling the session ourselves, i always want to walk in with the songs as close to complete as possible. obviously working with a producer means certain changes will happen in the moment (and be prepared to be open to those), but you don’t want to waste time on layups like melodies, lyrics, strumming patterns, who plays what, etc. caveating this doesn’t mean much if you truly can self-produce a record at a high-quality level. we unfortunately can’t do that lol.   once tracking and mixing was complete, we shot the ep off to our mastering house at rogue planet mastering voices onto the tracks, which provides more texture   3.	it helps other artists as they get a fully-produced track to hop on – this is free high quality content creation without any cost beyond slightly associating themselves with us.   4.	it alerts fanbases and streaming algorithms who is part of which scene. this helps serve your songs to your target community with more accuracy.   5.	it gives you a partner when marketing the track (features aren’t required to promote, but most will help introduce you to their followers/fans so long as you aren’t a dick)   overall, if a collab is a fit, it’s a real win-win for everyone involved. we found a feature for every track on this ep through different means. some were via introductions from folks we’ve met in the music industry. some were cold-calls via instagram. and others were found right here on reddit in r/popunkers. only one feature requested payment (everyone else was open to the exposure/free content), so we spent $300 in total from a feature standpoint.     prerelease prep   we pitched our first single “one more shot” to spotify a bit over a month in advance of our release date. at the very least, folks recommend pitching 4 weeks ahead of your release date so metadata can be ingested into spotify and internal playlist curators can review the track for placement. we’ve never been on an editorial playlist yet, but see below for our playlist pitch    *nyc's shower beers recruit sydney au heavyweights soso for an intl. pop punk riff-fest. monster gang-vocal chorus (050) gives way to mile-a-minute verse (118) that jumps from easycore to ska with total abandon ( a the sopranos sample for fun). prod. by hidden in plain view's rob freeman (cobra starship/gym class heroes) & mastered by grammy-nominated mike kalajian, would fit on pop punk's not dead or skatepark punks. promo includes a press/ad campaign via don't blink mgmt  a full featured ep*    we hit multiple points here in 500 characters the areas we’re both from, that the track is a collab, our genre is pop punk, timestamps on relevant high points in the track for review, a few stylistic points to raise intrigue, namedropping who produced/mastered the track  their previous work to establish credibility, what specific playlists we’d like to be on, and how we’re promoting the track (and by so doing promote spotify). you want your pitch to quickly explain who you are, why the track is worth listening to, and where you belong. take as much guesswork away from a curator – they listen to so much music they don’t have more than a few seconds to give you. amazon music also allows you to pitch songs prerelease – we used much of the same as above although they will allow you more characters.   now that the track was pitched, we had about 5 weeks to prepare for how we were going to promote this. below are what we felt were the tools at our disposal   •	social media content (ig/tiktok for the most part, followed by reddit/threads/twitter/youtube)   •	instagram ads   •	publisher/blog outreach   •	radio outreach   •	user-generated playlist pitching   •	podcast outreach   •	email marketing    pr   i partnered with don’t blink management    so yeah, it’s a lot of work for a \~6% hit rate. folks will debate the benefit of pr and radio in today’s music landscape, but pretty much i think it’s fun to see stuff get published or aired about our band. and end of the day, you do music because it’s fun, so i think it’s worth it.   i’m not going to give every pr template i have (you’ll change your message based on publisher/radio/podcasts), but below is what we wrote in regards to publishers (with relevant links removed)    **subject pr 11/9 release nyc pop punk band shower beers big-riff single**   *tldr - shower beers is dropping ""one more shot"" (the debut single off our new ep featuring australian heavyweights soso) on 11/9 and hope \pubname\ would be interested in covering the track.*    *hi \name\,*   *i'm \yourname\ from the nyc-based pop punk band shower beers. i'm reaching out as i noticed you've covered some pop-punk acts in the past \example here\ - we were hoping \name\ would consider covering our new single ""one more shot"" on or after our november 9th release.*   *streaming and download available at the private soundcloud link below*   *previewlink*   *produced at audio pilot studios by rob freeman (gym class heroes, cobra starship, hidden in plain view), ""one more shot"" is the debut single off our 2nd ep ""miracle on 34th & 3rd."" we teamed up with the saucy lads in soso from sydney, australia to create what we feel is an international smash. idobi radio once referred to our music as ""an uppercut with brass knuckles"" - we hope \name\ will agree.*   *feel free to reach out to me at this email if you have questions or need any more information. i've included our official press release via don't blink management here and our epk here.*   *thank you for your consideration!*    the subject line clearly defines what the email is about (calling out location and genre). i add a tldr at the top so editors don’t have to read too much before determining if this request is in their wheelhouse (you should only be reaching out to folks in your genre regardless). i try to be personal by finding editor names if i can and providing mine. i’m not attaching mp3 files but using streaming/download links – it’s rude to fill someone’s inbox storage with files. again, i’m providing credibility with our producer’s namedrop and a link to a previous article written about us by a publisher in the scene (idobi radio). i end with our press release and epk so editors should have everything needed to produce content.   the easiest way to find publishers is to be knowledgeable in your community. i read a good amount of the sites i reach out to. but in some cases, the 2nd easiest thing to do is google artists that are a bit more popular than you are and see who is writing about them. this way you’ll quickly put together a pr database in your genre.   with radio, it was much of the same as above. first i listed all radio stations in our genre i knew of. then, i googled our genres  radio (pop punk radio, punk rock radio, easycore radio, etc). once i scraped those, i used spotify analytics to find out which countries were listening to pop punk artists the most. for example, germany and indonesia are in our top 5 countries, so i made sure to spend extra time researching german and indonesian rock stations. then, i checked tour schedules for pop punk artists and found what us states indexed highest amongst the genre. after i had that list, i looked for the top rock-leaning college radio stations in those states. most collegiate stations will have program grids that list what songs/genres they’ve previously played. spending a few minutes looking for names that match your genre can help you identify who you want to reach out to and who you can skip.    a note on radio outreach you’ll want to use google drive or dropbox to host files since most stations will want larger .wav masters. you’ll also need to include a clean version of your track, specifically with college radios who try to remain fcc compliant. if you don’t produce your own music, you can easily use reaper or another daw to quickly edit curse words out (i’ll use a tape stop on bad words for example).    for social influencers, our pr agency had a roster they like to work with. on our end, i just reach out to my pals that have some pull and let them know we dropped a track. whether they promote that or not is on their own accord. if there is an influencer i really want to hear our track, i’ll dm them and then comment on a recent post to check their dms. it’s a lil intrusive but part of the game so i don’t think anyone gets too annoyed so long as you’re nice.   with podcasts, i’ll only reach out to shows i’ve listened to before. that way i understand how to prep for the convo and have background on the hosts.    an underappreciated aspect of going through the pr process is that at the very least, you’ll be introducing your brand and content to folks who are considered tastemakers. so while our first go here might not yield too much success, our name should become more familiar to influencers in the scene which hopefully can compound down the line.     social content   from a social media standpoint, i’m good enough with davinci resolve, on-screen text relevant to your brand that preps the viewer to watch your video, and a caption to engage them to comment. i’m admittedly not great at this but try to keep it in mind.    playlist pitching   playlist pitching is a double-edged sword. if you’re in a specific genre like we are (pop punk), it’s a bit easier to find relevant playlists. if you’re in a broad genre like pop or rap, you’re going to have a really hard time getting playlist success without paying/getting botted. just how it seems to be.   for us, we used 5 tools for our playlist database submithub, so i understand why so many folks complain about not having success on this service. it works decently enough for us.   groover i’ve never used before but saw u/makepopmusic say he liked it. i checked through the service for pop-punk playlists that would push the needle for us and found 5 that i wanted to pitch to. that ended up costing me like \~$20 for this single, so not too much. will report back how this works.   dailyplaylist is free which i love (we also curate a playlist here). i’ve seen a minor streaming jump on some playlists, nothing crazy though. at the very least with 20 free submissions a week, i’ve seen a few extra hundred listeners after using the site for a month or two.   playlistsupply is a scraper for spotify data. it will return playlist follower size and relevant contact info if available like email or social. i’ll start by searching our genre (pop punk, punk, emo, alternative, indie rock, rock, metal, metalcore, easycore, breakdown, etc), then larger similar artists (blink-182, sum 41, simple plan, beartooth, state champs, etc), then moods (workout, drinking, party, pregame, lifting, racing, etc). all said and done, i’ll collect about 80-100 extra contacts to email day-of release with a pitch. playlistsupply is $20 a month and i’ll cancel the first month after collecting what i need to collect. this is the first time i’m seriously using playlistsupply and will report back, but so far 100% of my responses have asked for pay-to-place so the experience isn’t great at this point. (i’ve read enough about all the different playlisting sites and these really are the only four i’ll bother with.)    lastly, i’ll go to similar artists on spotify and check their “discovered on” section via desktop. for the most part it’s easy to tell what playlists are spotify generated and what are user-generated. i’ll typically find a few extra emails by clicking the top playlists for artists. will report back on email responses.    email marketing   we can be better at this. we only collect emails via distrokid’s “presave” function and i feel like the presave wave is dead at this point. fans are too tired to click a link every time we drop a song and allow some third party access to their spotify, so we stopped pushing that. instead we just are asking our followers on instagram to follow us on spotify too. all this to say email is not really a tool we use much yet, but a lot of more established artists do.    instagram ads   our strategy is very specific here. i’ll only buy instagram story ads (no facebook ads due to high bot traffic, no ig reels because i just don’t like them). from here, i’ll make 3-4 pieces of very colorful, engaging creative with lyrics from different hooks in our song with a message to “swipe up for spotify.” you can probably find an example on our socials of one of the lyric videos that’ll look a bit like the ad we use.   from a targeting standpoint, i’ll run 3 separate ad set tiers based on cities. tier 1 “cities” are just the us, uk, and australia. tier 2 cities are music hotspots in pop-punk/our spotify analytics. this will include canadian, brazilian, mexican, german, and italian cities plus whatever other cities are jumping out in our song-specific analytics. lastly i’ll run tier 3 cities solely to metros in indonesia and the philippines. these countries have the lowest cpms of most other cities i want to run in with a huge amount of interest in rock music. i’ll actually allocate a large % of our daily spend to indonesia and the philippines because they’re awesome and i would love to tour there lol.    once geo is set, i’ll age-target to 18-44 or 49 (depending on the audience size). we’ll also “interest target” with an “and” statement. one portion of the target will just be “spotify”, while the other will be bands, genres, and events we’re similar to (all time low, pop punk, warped tour, etc). this tells meta to find fans who use spotify and also are fans of our genre. folks like andrew southward   3.	i’ll send an email blast to our presave email list asking them to listen and share the song on socials. easy message, keep it light.   4.	i’ll update all our websites – our link in bio, upload a visualizer to our youtube channel, upload files to soundcloud and bandcamp, submit the track to pandora amp’d, etc.   5.	i’ll playlist pitch to submithub, then dailyplaylist, then groover   6.	i’ll submit the track to be ingested by musixmatch so our lyrics can be tracked on socials/in spotify   7.	i’ll add our lyrics to genius   8.	i’ll email all the user-generated playlist emails i scrapped from spotify/playlistsupply with a pitch   9.	i’ll begin following up with every publisher/radio station/podcast over email with the spotify link letting them know our song is out and seeing if they were still interested in covering the release   10.	from here it’s probably 3am so i’ll climb into bed and pass out   11.	i’ll try to be up at 9am so i can post our youtube visualizer to appropriate reddit communities   12.	i’ll post a release announcement to tiktok at this time as well   13.	instagram, twitter, and threads i’ll wait until about 10am to post on main   14.	i’m also part of a few facebook groups – i typically never post on facebook but might give it a shot this time around   15.	i’ve also put together some funny flyers i’ll hang up around nyc just for sh!ts and giggles    from there, i’m slogging through a content push over our socials for the next few weeks until it’s time to do it all over again with the next track (since we’re pop punk, we’ll most likely wait until feb/away from the holidays). i’ll also use this downtime to start tracking demos for our next ep since being in the music cycle is a never-ending hamster wheel that forces you to continuously move until you fall off or die.     total cost   if we’re estimating/fudging costs from start to finish (again some of these aren’t the actual costs of my studio/pr), i’m spending about    creating the ep $4,000   features $300   pr	$600   playlisting $85   ads	$120   total $5,105      is it worth it?   our band has about 100k streams total after existing for a year, with our top track at 36k streams. we peaked at 10k monthly listeners back when we dropped our acoustic track in may but average around 2k monthlies when not releasing music. so is dropping \~$5,105 on recording an ep and promoting a single to an audience this size worth it? end of the day, we created something cool and it was heard by others (and sometimes even enjoyed). a few times i’ve met strangers in public at shows and they mentioned how much they liked our band. it continuously provides me with a sense of purpose. so yeah, while it’s a bit pricey, i think it’s worth it.   now if someone wanted to do music for a career, this whole scenario becomes a lot more stressful. this is a ton of work for very little monetary upside. i wouldn’t envy someone who’s attempting this without major backing and a comical amount of talent.    what can we do better?   i know a few areas i’ve self-critiqued if i wanted to get better at this whole thing   •	we don’t really play too many shows yet (it’s a lot of money and logistics to tour). we’re looking to start opening for folks in the nyc area to get started   •	i should accept my fate and start producing more personalized social content (get in front of the camera and dance my little dance)   •	i can spend more times in niche social platforms like discords, twitch streams, and yt shorts   •	i can learn/operate instagram advertising more efficiently via conversion pixels and a/b testing   •	we should start selling merch for additional income and roll that shop into email collection   •	spend time creating and managing a vehicle for more organic content (whether that be managing my own music blog, starting a podcast, etc)    if we’re being honest, i’m probably not going to try any of the above anytime soon because our current promotion efforts take so much time away from what i really enjoy, which is writing and recording music. but i do find fulfillment in being heard, so this all does feel a bit necessary.    hopefully this 8 page rundown helps a musician in the future plan for their release. being a successful musician today is pretty much an exercise in being a full-time brand manager. to summarize, you’ve gotta ensure your music is professional in all aspects, take the pitching process seriously, learn advertising, pr, and content creation, and try to remember that music is fun. hope you liked it, thanks.    chris/shower beers   ",16,3569

This is my 6th studio album release as a self funded artist playing acoustic rock with very minimal commerical success. 

For my latest album, I recorded overseas in Austin, Texas and decided to put as much strategy as possible into marketing my latest single, an upbeat pop-punk, fast tune as best I could.

I've tried a number of different techniques: playing open mics, playing album releases, touring, submithub, playlistpush with limited success. I reached a max of 3,000 streams on Spotify and some isolated community radio plays.

I asked around and was advised to hire a PR company to try to ""break into radio."" Here in Australia we have only one station to promote new artists that aren't signed to a major label, and that is Triple J, a government funded station with a quota for a number of Australian artists they have to play each week. 

I approached a number of different agencies with minimal success, the only agency who took me seriously was Beehive PR, based in Manly, Sydney. I spent $1500 AUD (about a month's rent, approx $1000 USD) for ""Editorials and Radio Pitching."" They were a pleasure to deal with, very professional, slick and easy, but I 
- barely saw 1,000 streams on Spotify,

It just doesn't fit a playlist. There's nothing wrong with it. I should point out the track in question is Hip Hop and the curator in question ticked all the boxes for the type, tempo and mood of track it was.

Anyway, my 2 cents.","i've been producing music for a long time, as in before spotify and streaming services were really a thing. have dealt with a number of labels over the years, who were always on the hunt for original music. a series of recent responses from a submithub submission got me thinking about the current state of affairs in music. that is that many of the people who hold a lot of sway  in the industry these days don't want original music, or so etching a bit different. this is not a ""woe is me"" post, or a commentary on submithub itself,and i expect people will just say sour grapes. just an observation. but the following response (a decline) is a good example **""the vocal is remarkable and awesome. really fantastic music, with original ideas and creative sounds. very cool production. this hip hop producer is great! amazing track, but the bpm is not suitable for us. all the best""** it just doesn't fit a playlist. there's nothing wrong with it. i should point out the track in question is hip hop and the curator in question ticked all the boxes for the type, tempo and mood of track it was. it's more relevant these days that you *do* sound like someone else, so ad to be marketable to the current format of playlisting. this is unfortunate if you ask me. being different used to be what the i dustry wanted. anyway, my 2 cents.",4,243

It also goes out of its way to say it doesn't deal with any bot playlists.

Usually I’m targeting Spotify playlisters as in my mind it’s the best way to net new followers or get your streaming numbers up. I generally don’t submit to Tik Tokers or content creators because my music isn’t really too poppy or serve well as background music. My experience has been that though it’s easier to place on Spotify playlists with a lower follower count, they generally don’t net many streams or new followers. 

My last campaign I targeted the big guys - 20K+ Spotify playlist followers to see if there was a difference. I was right. I landed on one playlist with 70K followers and got about 15,000 streams after a week. I didn’t retain many new Spotify followers from it, but granted it was my first single under a brand new artist name and idk if that had something to do with it. 

What has been your experience with SubmitHub? What’s the stream:followers ratio been like with bigger playlist placement versus the smaller guys? What percentage of the bigger Spotify playlists do you think are bot followers/plays or just other artists using SubmitHub like us?

I’m posting a bit later than usual (another busy day), but here we are nonetheless! 

1. I listened to all of the tracks on Spotify!

2. I reeeeaally dig these songs. They are well written, and all do such a great job of each bringing a unique feel and mood to the listener. Such a diverse range of instrumentation! As you know, I love horns, so hearing some trumpet in there made me excited lol. The acoustic songs are very powerful as well. Great job on everything so far! “it’s been some life” is my favorite, such a vibe!

3. Photos above! • Posted to IG story • Added song to our “Meet Our Friends” playlist • Posted song to r/songwriters

4. Followed on all platforms linked to account!

5. I think you’re putting out some great content already, and focusing on growing a solid fanbase should be the main focus alongside continuing to put out said content. I’ve recommended sites like submithub to a couple different people here, but it really does do wonders for your stream numbers/reach if you can get accepted to a few curator playlists. It’s relatively cheap to make submissions as well. 

Another thing that I think could help reach new ears (which is something we’re about to try ourselves with our next releases) is finding some similar artists with a bigger following, and seeing if they’d be interested in being featured on one of your tracks. That gives all of their fans a reason to check out your page, and can bring in a ton of new traffic if all goes well.

I always recommend Tik Tok to any musicians. It’s basically free advertising. The algorithm is very picky, and you have to post every day, but it can be a very lucrative way to reach your desired audience. I don’t *think* I saw a Tik Tok account linked to your page but I could be wrong… If not, it‘s always worth a shot!

Thanks for everything!","alright, it’s been a cool week of meeting and getting to know some fellow musicians! i’m posting a bit later than usual (another busy day), but here we are nonetheless!  1. i listened to all of the tracks on spotify! 2. i reeeeaally dig these songs. they are well written, and all do such a great job of each bringing a unique feel and mood to the listener. such a diverse range of instrumentation! as you know, i love horns, so hearing some trumpet in there made me excited lol. the acoustic songs are very powerful as well. great job on everything so far! “it’s been some life” is my favorite, such a vibe! 3. photos above! • posted to ig story • added song to our “meet our friends” playlist • posted song to r/songwriters 4. followed on all platforms linked to account! 5. i think you’re putting out some great content already, and focusing on growing a solid fanbase should be the main focus alongside continuing to put out said content. i’ve recommended sites like submithub to a couple different people here, but it really does do wonders for your stream numbers/reach if you can get accepted to a few curator playlists. it’s relatively cheap to make submissions as well.  another thing that i think could help reach new ears (which is something we’re about to try ourselves with our next releases) is finding some similar artists with a bigger following, and seeing if they’d be interested in being featured on one of your tracks. that gives all of their fans a reason to check out your page, and can bring in a ton of new traffic if all goes well. i always recommend tik tok to any musicians. it’s basically free advertising. the algorithm is very picky, and you have to post every day, but it can be a very lucrative way to reach your desired audience. i don’t *think* i saw a tik tok account linked to your page but i could be wrong… if not, it‘s always worth a shot! best of luck with everything u/journeyofrian, and i sincerely hope we can continue to promote eachother if this keeps going! thanks for everything!",25,368
17dhhap,1697936776.0,musicmarketing,LaSirena_666,Submithub feedback options,"Hey everyone!

I’m new to putting out music and just discovered submithub. 

I’ve been submiting a lot and found that I have about a 20% acceptation rate. I appreciate the platform and even though I’m generally a very sensitive person (working on it) I’ve been able to take the feedback like water off a ducks back. 

I want to talk about the 3 feedback options on submithub. First there’s “Specific and honest” which by the way, if anyone here selects this option (god bless, you must be made of steel) I wanted to ask how harsh exactly is the feedback? Does anyone have any examples they would be willing to share?

Then there’s “please be gentle” option. This is the option I always pick. The feedback generally rejects you in the nicest way possible, but then you’re given a reason for why they don’t want to select your track. 

My next question is, what is the point of this? The tracks we submit are a finished project that we paid money to complete. It’s not like we can go back in time to fix what the listener in this situation doesn’t like, plus this is all extremely subjective. So basically I don’t think the feedback could be constructive at all even if they wanted to be. 

The feedback I’ve received is that they like my instrumentals but don’t like my vocals. And thats fine but what am I supposed to do about that? I can’t change my voice or the way I sing, so I don’t understand what the point is of saying that to someone. 

I would prefer to get zero feedback and just a notification that the song was declined. I know I could just not look at the comments but I suppose it’s my own fault for being too curious.

My next question is if anyone knows why the approval rate is so much lower when you receive no feedback rather than the harsh/gentle feedback. The approval rate for no feedback is 12% vs. 28% if you do receive feedback. 

Thank you for listening and please be gentle. I’m just a soft sensitive artist who wants to know your opinions, I don’t need anymore harsh criticism and suppose wanted to vent to some other sensitive artistic souls. 🎃👻🧡",1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicmarketing/comments/17dhhap/submithub_feedback_options/,Submithub feedback options,submithub feedback options,"Hey everyone!

In this exciting story from **Darren**, we embark on a journey filled with music, dedication, and growth. Our protagonist's Spotify profile was a quiet place, with few followers and minimal song plays. As a music producer, specializing in the realms of hip-hop and house music, the struggle to finish and promote tracks was an ever-present challenge.

The turning point arrived in 2020 when a new direction beckoned. House music became the focus, complete with a fresh artist image and a new name. The central question was how to organically nurture a fan base. The answer was clear: genuine followers were the key, with streams following naturally.

The journey reached a critical juncture upon the discovery of the **Spotify Growth Switch**. This online coaching program provided the blueprint for an automated growth strategy on Spotify. The journey of success commenced with ad campaigns, strategically running in tandem with the creation of house music. The breakthrough came when an instrumental track featured in the first ad captured substantial attention.

To foster more followers, a curated playlist was crafted, supported by platforms like SubmitHub and Playlist Push. This strategic move breathed life into the playlist and translated into noticeable revenue growth. The ad budget scaled up consistently, with an astute breakdown of ad sets by country and the incorporation of a lookalike audience.

Throughout, **a valuable lesson was learned: consistency and patience are the cornerstones of success**. Ad campaigns never halted, and this unyielding commitment resulted in remarkable growth over time. Just a month ago, a significant milestone was achieved - a community of 10,000 Spotify followers, accompanied by a consistent rise in song plays. But this isn't the end; the quest now aims for an incredible 100,000 followers. 🥳

This journey stands as a testament to inspire fellow musicians and creators. The music industry's path is challenging, but with the right strategy and unwavering determination, dreams can be realized. Feel free to ask questions or share your own experiences.

I am a very small 23 year old artist in playing a very small gig tomorrow at a pay to play venue (you rent the space and keep whatever you make as a cover). as the title says, my dog died on Monday, and I’m having a really hard time. I am more depressed than I’ve been in years, made worse by knowing that, more than likely, nobody is going to show up to this thing anyways. i was barely able to function today, and forced myself to rehearse but made no progress. To top it off, I decided to check my presaves for the single that’s out on Friday, and realized that only one person had presaved it- me, accidentally. This is really upsetting because I put a lot of work and effort into my marketing, and I thought that my few close friends would at least support me. I had a pretty good reception on submithub, with around a 40% acceptance rate, including some really good blogs. Something tells me that something about my entire music project is just off, but I’m on the spectrum and have a really hard time with things like this. I want to cancel the show so badly; would I be an asshole for doing so? The only other person on the show is my boyfriend, who is doing an electronics opening set for me. He says I will regret not taking the oppurunity to preform, but I feel like I will just cry on stage if I try to play. Any input would be really appreciated.

Playlist Curators

There aren't many playlist curators to begin with, especially true if your music falls outside of pop. You may find 100-300 listed, but the vast majority don't really accept your genre. It still lists them though.

The paid curators do not and do not have to listen to your song for more than 1 minute. They are only there for some very quick and easy cash. They are not coming there to find new or good music.

The feedback is nonsensical. As an example on of one of the paid curators said my hook lacked variation. Lol Hooks aren't suppossed to have variation, that's what makes them hooks. To be clear my hook isn't short and repeated over and over, here is the hook.

The cost of a dollar is higher than it's ever been.

Evils of men that used to live within

Are now on the outside looking in

A badge of dishonor they wear like skin

I fought for everything I have I own my scars

Won't bow to the kings or the queens or the czars

Devour their towers strip their powers

The world isn't yours It's ours

Blogs

Be serious, almost no one goes to blogs to find or read about music, maybe some gossip blogs that don't actually cover music.

Youtubers

Only a couple out of around 180 on my search did youtube submissions. That's very low.

TikTok

I didn't bother with this. You'd have to ask someone else.

All curators

The majority of them don't have many followers or listeners 30-50 per month is about the average. Very few of them are on there to find new music. Even if a few of them are, theynhave no reach, so no real impact on your music's exposure. So, what exactly are you paying for?

I only spent 10 bucks, so it's not a huge deal. Had I wanted to spend more, there would have been no reason to. There was no one to submit to. Lol

Hot or not

This is ok but not great. 100% of the feedback on there was extremely positive. The thing is, the ratings are all over the place. Someone says something like, ""This song is amazing! It's the best song I've heard all year."" But they rate it a 68, above their average rating of 58.

Skips pull your average rating score down too. So, if you have a intro section to your song, good luck. Some people are simply trying to rush through giving reviews to get their own songs reviewed.

It is such a waste of money that if the owner or their support were to say, sorry, we are going to give you a 1, 000 dollar credit to make it right.

16vlazy,1696016649.0,musicmarketing,lilboss049,The Truth About Groover,"Let me start by saying that I am a pop artist that has been focused on growing an organic fan base over the last year. I have been releasing 1 new song every 5 weeks so that I am always pushing out content and feeding the Spotify algorithm. With each new release, I promote the song for 5 weeks. I use Instagram Ads, Facebook Ads, and playlist pitching (SubmitHub and Groover). I have grown my IG from 500 to over 3k. I average at least 10k monthly listeners on Spotify and have over 200k total streams across 12 releases. I am even starting to grow at a steady pace on Apple Music just off of my ads campaign. So I'm not HUGE or anything, but I would consider myself as starting to become established. My music has high quality mixing, high quality production (I hire a professional producer on SoundBetter), and is professionally mastered. So, naturally, my music has a professional feel to it and it is something I'm proud of. So why then, does Groover troll me? Let me explain. 

Initially, I really liked Groover, mostly because it has a HUGE curator base. But after using Groover for over 1 year, I am finally convinced that 90% of the curators on this site are just trying to get paid. Why do I say this? Because, although my music sounds ""professional and on par with the industry standard,"" my song is almost NEVER added to playlists on Groover. Let me show you some screenshots:

Keep in mind that this song is a Pop Ballad with a Rap in Verse 2. So it's a Pop/Rap song with like a Marshmello type beat. It sounds very similar to something Juice Wrld, The Kid Laroi, JB, Post Malone or Halsey might put out. It is a sad song about how hard it is to let someone go with a very catchy hook, and again professionally mixed, mastered, lined up, and produced. All of these curators proceed to tell me the exact same thing. Then tell me that it's not a fit for their playlist. I go to their playlist and guess who's on their playlists. Juice Wrld, Post, Kid, JB, etc. It's honestly all a load of crap. ""Your song is AMAZING, well produced, sounds professional, but we aren't gonna add it. Thanks send us your next track."" This has been my experience with Groover for the last year. So for those of you out there who are trying to get your music out there, just be very careful here.

I have already spent THOUSANDS of dollars on this website, and yet I get WAY better exposure just running my own ads.","let me start by saying that i am a pop artist that has been focused on growing an organic fan base over the last year. i have been releasing 1 new song every 5 weeks so that i am always pushing out content and feeding the spotify algorithm. with each new release, i promote the song for 5 weeks. i use instagram ads, facebook ads, and playlist pitching (submithub and groover). i have grown my ig from 500 to over 3k. i average at least 10k monthly listeners on spotify and have over 200k total streams across 12 releases. i am even starting to grow at a steady pace on apple music just off of my ads campaign. so i'm not huge or anything, but i would consider myself as starting to become established. my music has high quality mixing, high quality production (i hire a professional producer on soundbetter), and is professionally mastered. so, naturally, my music has a professional feel to it and it is something i'm proud of. so why then, does groover troll me? let me explain.  initially, i really liked groover, mostly because it has a huge curator base. but after using groover for over 1 year, i am finally convinced that 90% of the curators on this site are just trying to get paid. why do i say this? because, although my music sounds ""professional and on par with the industry standard,"" my song is almost never added to playlists on groover. let me show you some screenshots &x200b; keep in mind that this song is a pop ballad with a rap in verse 2. so it's a pop/rap song with like a marshmello type beat. it sounds very similar to something juice wrld, the kid laroi, jb, post malone or halsey might put out. it is a sad song about how hard it is to let someone go with a very catchy hook, and again professionally mixed, mastered, lined up, and produced. all of these curators proceed to tell me the exact same thing. then tell me that it's not a fit for their playlist. i go to their playlist and guess who's on their playlists. juice wrld, post, kid, jb, etc. it's honestly all a load of crap. ""your song is amazing, well produced, sounds professional, but we aren't gonna add it. thanks send us your next track."" this has been my experience with groover for the last year. so for those of you out there who are trying to get your music out there, just be very careful here. in my opinion, the owner of the site needs to clean this up. i have already spent thousands of dollars on this website, and yet i get way better exposure just running my own ads.",4,463
16tbujz,1695792277.0,musicmarketing,OpeningBrush1798,Submission advice?,"Hi everyone, I have two questions regarding submission to playlists and blogs. 

1. I’ve uploaded my first single to distrokid about a week ago but my Spotify for artists isn’t showing up yet so I can’t submit to playlists through Spotify for artists. The song is coming out on October 6th. I was wondering if anyone else ran into this issue and if they were able to use Spotify for artists on time to submit to Spotify playlists?? 

2. I just started submitting on submithub and created a musosoup campaign today. I’ve gotten denied 4 times on submithub already, but I’ve received 10 musoup offers within the past 7 hours so that’s pretty exciting. The only thing is that they’re all small blogs with barely any followers and their playlists basically have the same songs, like they just send offers to everyone on the page. I did get one offer from a pretty big tiktoker that I’m excited about though. Anyways, I was wondering if since this is my first release, I should take all the press I get in hopes that bigger curators will take notice, or should I accept the playlist adds and only take blog offers from reputable press so as to not dampen my artist brand?

16tbpq5,1695791865.0,musicmarketing,oldjack,Groover is trash,"(1) The website itself is terrible. After you search, you have to click on a curator to see whether they have 17,000 Spotify followers or 42 or 0. This forces you to click back and forth constantly. There is no way to sort by followers so you waste time checking if anyone is even worth your money.

(2) Curators misrepresent their interests. They claim they want multiple genres of music and then reject you because they only accept one specific genre. This is an obvious bait-and-switch designed to get your money. Or they broadly claim they want artists that sound like ""Post Malone"", ""Radiohead"", ""Blink 182"", ""Kendrick Lamar"", and ""Tame Impala""...wtf is this? And the curators that actually have focused interests have zero following so they're worthless.

(3) The technical feedback proves the curators are clueless. I'm totally ok if someone simply doesn't like the style of my song. But when some unqualified curator says ""the vocals are too low in the mix"" when they objectively aren't, or the guitars ""have too much compression"" when they're not compressed, it shows these people are just pretending to sound knowledgeable. One curator even suggested our singer should sing in a completely different style-- as if an established band with published music is gonna change their sound for one random person. Totally illogical feedback.

To be clear, I've had songs accepted and rejected on Groover, Submithub, and Daily Playlists. I've got reasonable feedback and dumb feedback on all three as well. Only Groover has been consistently frustrating. In my experience, Groover is more expensive than Submithub with a worse product.",1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicmarketing/comments/16tbpq5/groover_is_trash/,Groover is trash,groover is trash,"(1) The website itself is terrible.

16ss90o,1695744839.0,musicmarketing,HausPlontze,Any ideas as to how to promote a Live Sci-Fi Comedy Musical Album?,"Hello! So I've spent my entire summer writing, rehearsing, performing, and producing an entire full length concept album with an accompanying live concert video. It's basically absurdist ""adult swim"" style humor packaged into a synth pop/rock musical form.

It can be compared to something like Rocky Horror Picture Show.

My Question is: How do I promote something so specifically niche?

Also, I had a bit of luck on submithub (like 10% accepted) so give those free credits a try.

As an indie artist, you have the freedom and flexibility to create and release music on your own terms. But you also face the challenge of promoting your music without the support of a label or a team. How do you get your music heard by more people and grow your fanbase? Here are some of the best ways to promote your music as an indie artist.

&amp;#x200B;

* Distribute your music widely. The first step in promoting your music is making it available on all the major streaming platforms, such as Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, Amazon Music, and more. You can use a music distribution company like CD Baby or DistroKid to upload your music across these platforms for a fee. This way, you can reach more listeners and earn royalties from streams.

&amp;#x200B;

* Build your website. Your website is your home base on the internet where you can showcase your music, bio, photos, videos, tour dates, merch store, blog posts, and more. You can use a website builder like Bandzoogle or Squarespace to create a professional-looking website in minutes with all the features you need. Your website should also have a signup form for your email list so that you can collect contact information from your fans and keep in touch with them.

&amp;#x200B;

* Grow your email list. Your email list is one of the most valuable assets you have as an indie artist. It allows you to communicate directly with your fans without relying on social media algorithms or platforms. You can use email marketing tools like Mailchimp or ConvertKit to send newsletters, updates, offers, and exclusive content to your subscribers. You can also use incentives like free downloads or discounts to encourage people to sign up for your list.

&amp;#x200B;

* Leverage social media. Social media is a great way to connect with your fans and potential fans on a personal level. You can use platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, and more to share your music, behind-the-scenes, stories, live streams, polls, contests, and more. You can also use social media ads to reach new audiences and drive traffic to your website, streaming platforms, or email list.

&amp;#x200B;

* Collaborate with other artists. Collaborating with other artists is a win-win situation for both parties. You can expose your music to each other’s fanbases, cross-promote your releases, and create something new and exciting together. You can collaborate with artists who have a similar genre, style, or audience as you, or you can experiment with different genres and styles to expand your musical horizons. You can also collaborate with artists who have a larger or more engaged fanbase than you and leverage their influence and credibility.

&amp;#x200B;

* Pitch to playlists. Playlists are one of the most effective ways to get your music discovered by new listeners and increase your streams. You can pitch your music to playlists on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, and other platforms using various methods. You can use Spotify’s official playlist submission tool to pitch your music to their editorial team. You can also use third-party services like SubmitHub or Playlist Push to pitch your music to independent curators. You can also network with other artists and playlisters and ask them to add your music to their playlists.

&amp;#x200B;

* Perform live. Performing live is one of the best ways to promote your music as an indie artist. It allows you to showcase your talent, charisma, and personality on stage and create a memorable experience for your fans. You can also sell merch and CDs at your shows and collect email addresses from attendees. You can perform live at local venues, festivals, open mics, or online platforms like Twitch or StageIt. You can also use live streaming tools like OBS or StreamYard to broadcast your performances on social media.

Adding your songs to playlists seems to be a good strategy to promote your songs, but this field has been cluttered with a lot of fake playlists and in the end, I just feel that submitting your music to curators became less interesting over time.

There are a lot of tools to help you in this task (submithub, groover, isitagoodplaylist, ...) but submitting your songs still requires to pay a fee, which for most artists is not really worth it or we simply don't have the budget.

So I was wondering: how to get on good playlists, for free? Maybe doing trades with other artists would work? For example, artist A will put my song in its playlist for 2 weeks, and in exchange I will put his song into my playlist for 2 weeks. It's free and both artists win.

Playlist Push requires hundreds of dollars and you don’t get to see who you submit to until after you spend your money. It’s a huge gamble. You could find out after they take your money that half the playlists weren’t even a good fit in the first place 

Submithub lets you do research beforehand which is cool but they pay less. It’s a lot of work to be a quality curator/influencer and they deserve to get paid. It’s better for promoters to be somewhere like PlaylistPush because they get paid more, but this hurts artists 

If submithub raised its prices it would attract more quality promoters and we as artists could make more educated decisions. We also wouldn’t waste as much money.

Something’s gotta change because music promo is too expensive. You either have to be a TikTok fiend and post 5x a day or you have to spend 500$+ on mystery playlist promo and get ripped off. Or run ads but that’s also expensive and has a high learning curve

These mystery box playlist companies like PlayListPush have got to go, or be more transparent. And submithub should do a better job of amassing quality. I imagine that means increasing their prices a bit. The max is 4 credits? Folks on PlaylistPush can make like 10$ per submission.

1622fa7,1693073888.0,edmproduction,alfiealfiealfie,I'm a curator on Submithub - here's what I've learned being on the other side of the fence,"Hi

I use Submithub lots to submit music to curators and it's terribly difficult getting anything placed. But recently, and due to my niche blog, I've become a curator. Here's what I've learned and what might help you get more success:

1)Personalise your pitch. Often times folks have zero pitch (booo!) or other times its generic (meh). But it really makes me sit up and pay attention when folks have gone the extra mile to read my blog and cross reference their music with what I've written about. It shows you care. 

2)Mono control your mixes. Sometimes due to where I am and time constraints I'll listen on mobile. My mobile plays in mono and you would not believe how troublesome some songs sound when played in mono. Please check your mixes in mono. I do cross check later on my studio set up so I can hear the difference when played in stereo, but I don't always do this. Mono control FTW

3)When I offer to write about you I'll ask for more information about the track; how it was written, influences etc. You would not believe the amount of folks who don't reply to this request. Getting more information from you about the song helps me personalise it. 

4)I write about EDM, and Japanese music. After the first few weeks I got a lot of submissions outside my genre selection so I updated my bio to say what genres I can't write about due to lack of knowledge or taste and yet I'll still get some submissions in those genres. I'll still listen, but I'll be on the back foot. 

5)Even if you get rejected, still send stuff over. I can see if you've submitted before to me and I like your tenacity. +1 point for you.

6)If I don't like a song I'll say so but I'll also say why. I try to be accurate and honest in my feedback. It's not personal and I hope my feedback helps you improve. 

So, there you have it. Good luck out there and hope this note finds you well. Music PR is really very hard and those that make the effort will go places.",1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/1622fa7/im_a_curator_on_submithub_heres_what_ive_learned/,I'm a curator on Submithub - here's what I've learned being on the other side of the fence,i'm a curator on submithub - here's what i've learned being on the other side of the fence,"Hi I use Submithub lots to submit music to curators and it's terribly difficult getting anything placed.

There’s two songs in total-

One is a Christian song- inside your shield- by expresso collaboration. But it’s like a chill somewhat folkxrnb mix. I don’t really think it’s what young people like to hear.

The other is more commercial ready indie pop / bedroom pop song (honestly it costed a lot more because, i miss understood and didn’t understand I need a producer too, yes I’m whack), the song’s name is bluebird by expresso collaboration. 

Do you guys mind telling me how to get exposure even though I practically have near to zero YouTube views and below 100 Spotify listeners? Streams in the hundreds but those are mostly family n friends. I tried sound campaign cuz i was a crackhead that apparently didn’t value lunch money enough (now I’m gonna eat bread for how many days haha), and submithub but it’s just not working out.

(I can’t do covers since I can’t sing, mostly just write lyrics).

Oh and hit me up if you need lyrics, I can give them for free (I just want my name out there) or 5% royalty (Just if you like the lyrics enough- still credit me pls) or like, no one will probably want a stranger’s lyrics when we all like expressing ourselves but….

I finished a new song and posted it on Submithub. While most of the feedback is what I expected, more than one person noted the production quality as something to work on. I don't know for sure that it's the mix that they mean, but that's what I'm assuming.

I'm still new to audio engineering, so I'm thinking I just don't have the ear yet to really hear the difference between what I'm doing and professional mixes. Would someone with more experience than me be willing to give some thoughts about what I can work on and things that stand out in the track as being unrefined? Feel free to be very frank, you aren't going to hurt my feelings :)

I'm still new to audio engineering, so I'm thinking I just don't have the ear yet to really hear the difference between what I'm doing and professional mixes. Would someone with more experience than me be willing to give some thoughts about what I can work on and things that stand out in the track as being unrefined? Feel free to be very frank, you aren't going to hurt my feelings :)

Thank you so much in advance.

15gek3m,1690996116.0,musicmarketing,marklonesome,Could this be working??,"I, like many of you. Have been looking for ways to promote my music without gigging and using social media.

While I know that is the most reliable/best way to do it. I'm stubborn and I don't wanna play out and I fucking loathe social media.

With that said, I've been doing playlist placement with sites like Submithub etc...

As expected I'd get a few hundred streams and added to a handful or private playlists. 

Recently I tried moonstrive and they put me on some pretty big playlists.

I checked them out and it's what you'd expect. A huge spotify playlist that has little relevance to my music... I'm basically sandwiched between Elvis and The Beach Boys... and I'm not at all in those genres.

But here's where the interesting thing happened. 

I got about 2000 streams through that playlist but when I went to check it out the other day I had been added to about 8 other playlists that I didn't submit too or pay for and they're all relevant to my music. 

Does that mean that this is somewhat working??

I know it's never going to be as good as doing it the tried and true way (gigging and social) but in as much as this road CAN get you somewhere.....

The music I make I would describe mostly as Cosmic Rock'N'Roll which is very influenced by 1960's/1970s rock and roll with artists such as The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, T-Rex and thin lizzy as well as strong influences from 1950s rockabilly, country, motown and blues. I also have other songs influenced by 60s folky psychedelic pop.

Recently I have been getting feedback on submithub which I have really enjoyed seeing but something that surprised me and interested me was getting comparisons to artists I dont really listen to or play in genres that I dont play in myself. An example  that suprised me the most would be getting comparisons to pop-punk and bands like green day and blink-182 neither of which I have ever really listened to and didn't influence me. I have also had comparissons to artists i dont really listen to but I can understand why they might guess their my influences with bands like kiss, beach boys and david bowie. Having had this feedback I can actually hear were people are getting these vibes which has really interested me. At the same time normally people generally can hear my actual influences but I find it so cool the way people can perceive my music in a completely different genre to me!

15afew7,1690400131.0,musicmarketing,conversebasin,Where to Start with Label Partnerships,"Hello, I'm having trouble figuring out where to start with labels. I'm on pace to finish 50 songs this year in the indie pop/rock/electronic genres. Strayed away quite a bit from my DJ roots as I evolve as an artist.

I could prolly do more songs, but I have a full-time job and am doing an undergrad voice program at Berklee. Also, the songs have to be written, practiced, and recorded. One song a week is quite a bit of work to actually finish.

Thankfully, I am working with a pro producer, so my role as the artist is mainly singing and songwriting.

My question is, where do I start with finding a label to partner with? Should I release singles, should I just submit all of them to labels and let them be broken up into wherever they go, should I form 3 albums out of them?

It seems there are 3 distinct types of songs (indiepop, indierock, and indietronica), so could do 3 albums, but I don't know of a label to talk to who would be interested in 3 albums. Labels are all about singles, but my projects tell a story, and I think should be released together.

Any ideas where to start besides labelradar, submithub, or groover?

Is it best to just put them all out as singles, let them all spread their wings in different directions, like a pack of butterflies? That might be a bit chaotic, but it sure would plant a lot of seeds.

# Why are Spotify Playlists Important?

Spotify playlists are a powerful tool for promoting your music. They are a collection of songs curated by a playlist creator and can be found by millions of Spotify users worldwide. Getting your music on a popular playlist can increase your streams, gain you new fans, and ultimately help you grow your career as a musician.

How to Find Spotify Playlist Curators

### 1. Use Third-Party Curator Websites

There are many websites that list popular Spotify playlists and their curators. Some of the most popular ones include:

* Soundplate: This website has a large database of Spotify playlists and their curators, making it a great resource for finding the right playlists to target.
* SubmitHub: SubmitHub allows you to submit your music directly to playlist curators, as well as music bloggers and record labels.
* PlaylistPush: This website connects independent artists with Spotify playlist curators for a fee.

### 2. Use Spotify Search

You can also use Spotify's search function to find playlists related to your music genre. Simply search for a relevant keyword, such as ""indie rock,"" and select the ""Playlists"" tab. This will show you a list of playlists related to that keyword, along with their curators.

### 3. Use Social Media

Many playlist curators have a strong social media presence. You can use platforms like Twitter and Instagram to find and follow playlist curators in your music genre. Engage with their content and build a relationship with them before pitching your music.

## How to Contact Spotify Playlist Curators

When contacting playlist curators, it's important to personalize your pitch. Show that you have taken the time to listen to their playlist and explain why your music would be a good fit.

### 2. Be Professional

Make sure your email is professional and well-written. Avoid using slang or overly casual language. You want to come across as a serious artist who is worth adding to their playlist.

### 3. Follow up

If you don't hear back from a playlist curator, don't be afraid to follow up. But be sure to give them enough time to listen to your music before doing so. A polite follow-up email can help you stand out from other artists and increase your chances of getting featured.

The playlists seem to be legit and the streams from these playlists (118 after 4 days and 21 after 3 days of being placed) are nothing crazy. These numbers are taken from spotify for artists and correspond with the amount of followers the playlists have. 

But now the past 2 days we have suddenly gained more than 2000 streams. The days before this the  number was around 50 a day in total. Spotify for artist shows that most of these streams come from our profile, not through playlists. However, the streams all went to the song that was playlisted through submithub. A large part of them are from locations like Ashburn and Victoria USA. This means we are pretty sure these are fake streams.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ie0o3nbjukbb1.png?width=647&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97ca1a53b73845e5df7c0c09ab0ba52a85f18cc0

So, the question is, how to make your music promo ads pay for themselves? Here are three monetization strategies to achieve a return on your investment. Let's dive in! 👇

Strategy 1: Earn ROYALTIES on Spotify! Get paid between 0.003 to 0.005 cents per stream. Compare this to ad costs on Facebook or Instagram, ranging from 10 to 50 cents per listener. Break even by accumulating 50-100 streams from each listener. Patience is key! ⏳

Strategy 2: Become a PLAYLIST CURATOR. Create a themed playlist, add your tracks, and curate other artists' songs. Use platforms like SubmitHub or Groover to earn money while curating. Grow your playlist, gain more listeners, and promote your own music. 🎧💡

Strategy 3: Another strategy to fund your promotion campaigns is making money with MERCHANDISE. Create unique products like t-shirts or accessories featuring your brand or artwork, and sell them to your fans. The profit earned can be reinvested into promoting your music. 

It's a win-win!

\*Aaaand it is also here to point out mistakes I wouldn’t repeat myself nor would love anyone else to repeat them!

\*\*This is a very long post, sorry!

To give you a little bit of context - I moved to Melbourne from Croatia in mid-2019 and until then I was a front woman in a successful post-punk band. 

Arrived to Melbourne without knowing anyone, then the longest lockdown hit and by 2021 I realised I need to pivot and do something solo because there was no way for me to meet people, form a new band and perform live. So I started learning Ableton and now here I am, just released my debut album which is also my debut as a record producer. 

The music I do is very niche and specific; most of the songs are bilingual where I combine traditional Croatian/Slavic folk singing into my choruses or intros with experimental dark wave/EBM/even trip-hop elements. I call it Slavic-pop, Slavic-darkwave, a lot of people compares me with IC3PEAK, Sevaliza, FKA Twigs, Slavic Fever Ray/Knife.

This new solo project is called ŽIVA (as in ‘being alive’) and you can find it on all platforms (socials handle is \_xziva).

This also means that literally no one knows about me here in Australia except for my 5 friends and my partner, while in the Balkans I do have a decent following and a good media support. 

Last thing to take into the account is that like a lot of us here, everything I do is DIY; this is a one-woman show where I do literally everything from song composition, production and live performance, to styling, social media, marketing etc…And since I learn on the go, I’ve made a lot of mistakes that I can now see clearly in hindsight…So keep that in mind as well!

**TIMELINE I’ve used for my releases:**

April 10th | Early access open for single Bad Blood (if you leave your email and follow on Spotify, you get the single video in your inbox 24 hours before everyone else)

**April 21st** | Single out (with video) + album announcement

April 28th | Single launch gig (headline) in Melbourne

**May 23rd** | Debut album out

May 25th | Album launch gig (headline) in Melbourne

1. **SubmitHub** 

For me, this was the biggest waste of money and something I will never ever repeat. Luckily I didn’t spend too much money but I should have listened to my gut feeling as well as most of your posts here. While I actually did have some success and got featured in some of the independent media/playlists, it was not worth either the money nor the time. It feels wrong while I do it and although I can partially see the idea behind having a paywall because journalism has been discredited and underpaid for a long time, this is not a way to go.

I also did an experiment and paid an influencer to put one of my songs up in her video + asked her for stats after, but since there is no way of knowing how many people actually came from her profile to mine, I don’t see the value in continuing to invest in this.

**📚Conclusion:** Works better for generic songs, nothing too experimental, will never do this again, would perhaps re-consider it if I am doing something more mainstream but even then would need more convincing.

This was my first time ever doing these, so a huuuuge learning curve. To teach myself how to do this, I was reading everything on this sub + did a lot of YouTube tutorials such as the one from Andrew Southworth to get ideas.

1. **Publicist**

I didn’t use a paid PR / publicist this time because I just couldn’t afford it BUT now I am happy that played that way. Reason being - I was quoted $4000AUD for an album campaign and yet I’ve managed to get a positive response from almost all those media outlets myself (to whom they would have reached out). The biggest drawback from not hiring them is the fact that I didn't manage to get 1(!?) TripleJ Unearthed review and Australian media outlet feature. This is probably the hardest thing I ever wanted to break, I literally have 0 responses from any Aussie based outlet. This is also something I want to crack, just not sure where's the catch - is it that the publicists are gatekeepers or its just too competitive and I am unknown....

Important to note is that I did hire them for a single campaign back in 2022 and while it did yield some features and TripleJ reviews...It was too much work for me. I literally had to write texts for different Aussie blogs that have various topics (name your top 5 artists and why etc)...it ended up being quite a lot of work for me as an artists rather than just chilling while someone else does it. It might be that I have the wrong approach but idk...

Still - I think it is waaaay too expensive and at this stage (until proven otherwise) I will rather grind myself and persevere and send loads of emails than pay this insane amount. 

**📚Conclusion:** Not worth the money, my stand atm is that I will invest in my materials, my music, photos, instagram profile, tiktoks, live performances....and then those outlets will eventually will come to me? **💡 Is is wrong to think this?** 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Socials**

I’ve literally have never been this active on socials as I am since mid March, early April. I figured that this is the way to go and decided to approach it as part of the job and give it structure which always works for me and leaves out any unnecessary dwelling and procrastination. 

TikTok - I barely did anything….and this is my biggest problem atm and something I actually plan to tackle now, sort of post-album release, create some videos about the process etc..this is my weak point and everything would probably be even better if I had resolved this and been active.

But regarding Instagram &amp; FB there are two biggest changes in my approach that seem to change my game completely and yield MASSIVE results. 

a) I now actually actively engage with my followers, watch their stories, comment, interact….It actually feels good, I do it in a natural way, interact with content I really do resonate with so it’s actually not hard, just needs dedication &amp; time. 

b) I decided to just continue being genuine in my posts and if it doesn’t do well (in the numbers game) - who cares, at least it’s really me rather than something I thought will get viral. This really helped alleviate some of the imposter syndrome feelings which are present whenever I post something. 

**📚Conclusion:** These two combined ended up creating an amazing community of almost die hard fans for me, where every single one of them shared the news about my album.

1. **Spotify Playlisting**

USER PLAYLISTS: I took the manual route and this time actually skimmed the entire Spotify to find playlists that could potentially put my song onto their playlist. It took a lot of time but it also yielded incredible results FOR 0 money!

PAID PLAYLISTS: I’ve done just one for the sake of gaining information and doing the math. I paid $15USD to get the following:   
\- placement on two playlists that have 7k listeners combined

\- feature/reshare of my single video on an IG profile that has 200k followers

I got around 300 streams from this up until this point (3 weeks).

EDITORIAL PLAYLISTS: No success. I’ve pitched 2 songs (single and then another one I choose from the album) and even included suggestions on what playlists I think I would be a great fit but yeah, zero points here.

**📚Conclusion:** Knowing your genre is one of the most important thing because it is an information you use to wisely create ads + pitch your music to the right people aka playlisters. I will keep on doing this although its time consuming to go through Spotify and their instagram, but totally worthwhile if you have the right song/genre! Those playlists are your potential fans and they will do it for free!

13p398q,1684789402.0,musicmarketing,watkinobe,Update to my previous post,"As promised, I am providing an update to [this original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/musicmarketing/comments/13ikakj/i_direct_the_marketing_efforts_of_a_60000000year/)

The short answer: Yes. Following the rules of Marketing 101 works as well for music as any other segment of our economy.

Let me explain the methodology I used to confirm this:

* &amp;#x200B;

1. Know your product

I chose (5) tracks culled from three album releases that I deemed ""worthy"" based on audience engagement, positive feedback from my worst critics, and my own gut instinct that they were my strongest tracks.

* 2. Research your demographics

Referring to music industry statistics and other music consumer studies relevant to my genre (electronic, retro-electronic, electro-rock) my core listening audience was likely a white male European between the ages of 35 - 55 years of age.

* 3. Invest in your marketing campaign

I created (5) unique video ads for each music track with rotating call-to-action messages asking people to click the ""Listen Now"" button.

The ""Listen Now"" button is linked directly to the associated track on Spotify. In other words, if they clicked on the Facebook / Instagram sponsored ad, they would be taken directly to the same track in Spotify.

I committed to spending $20/day for 5 days on my Meta Business Page. The ads targeted the above-mentioned demographics. Plus, I created identical ad sets based on targeting global ""music cities"" - that is - cities recognized internationally for their vibrant music scenes. I chose Paris, France, Berlin, German, 7 cities in the UK, and 20 cities in the United States.

5 days is the minimum period of time needed to allow Meta to adjust their AI placement algorithms to maximize results.

Here are the results:

The combined ad groups reached 17,804 users. This is the total number of \*unique\* individuals who had the ad appear on their screens.

Those reached generated 1,062 clicks on the ""Listen Now"" button for a total cost of $108.

This is a click-through rate (CTR) of 5.96%. Meta's average CTR for all ad accounts is between 2 - 4%, so an almost 6% CTR is *amazing* and indicates exceptional targeting results based on user demographics and geography.

Where the ""rubber meets the road"" is the number of *actual conversions.* A ""conversion"" in this case is defined as someone who streamed the track on Spotify for 30 seconds or more. When comparing the actual Spotify streams to the CTR for the identical time period, the 1,062 clicks resulted in 97 **actual streams.**

So the math here is pretty easy: A conversion rate of just under 10%. This result *is not* exceptional - but average according to Meta. Some product segments perform better (diet and fitness) some perform worse (retail, professional services).

**Here's the bottom line based on this limited study:**

Assuming you do an amazing job of defining your audience and you have music people actually want to hear, expect to spend right around $1 per stream on Spotify. As I said, the math here is really easy. Do you want 1000 streams per month on Spotify? Plan to spend $1000/month for a Facebook/Instagram ad campaign.

An interesting side note? Meta's algorithms got the lowest cost-per-click (CPC) from men living in Paris, France. I can only speculate as to why, but as a result, most of my streams ended up coming from either Paris, France, or the UK. I had to pay almost 2X as much for clicks from the USA, so Meta stopped delivering ads to the USA.

**Finally:** Ad performance improves over time. A 5-week campaign will perform more efficiently than a 5-day campaign. Also, this study was too short of a time period to gather meaningful data on audience retention. One could reasonably expect ""X"" number of streams will equal ""Y"" number of followers and followers are what you want because they will continue to engage with you on Spotify after they've been ""bought and paid for"" from the initial social media campaign. My instinct as a marketing professional is that the streams-to-followers conversion rate will be the lowest. I'm guessing in the neighborhood of 1 - 2% of streams result in follows. Are you prepared to pay $100 per follower? I'm not.

TL;DR:  A brief study using an actual Meta Facebook/Instagram sponsored campaign reveals a well-targeted ad strategy can expect to pay $1/per stream on Spotify.

Nevertheless, I would argue these results are STILL better than what you'll get using rip-off services like SubmitHub, Musosoup, etc.",3,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicmarketing/comments/13p398q/update_to_my_previous_post/,Update to my previous post,update to my previous post,"As promised, I am providing an update to this original post. tracks culled from three album releases that I deemed ""worthy"" based on audience engagement, positive feedback from my worst critics, and my own gut instinct that they were my strongest tracks. * 2.

- Pitching to Spotify editorial playlists (never worked)
- Sharing on all social media platforms, sometimes advertising
- Sharing a live cover of my own song
- Submitting to different playlist curators on platforms like SubmitHub
- Emailing different YouTube channel owners to be included in their compilations
- Emailing to different radio stations I can find online

One thing that I’m not good at, but might be worth doing, is coming up with content for TikTok and Instagram Reels, and sharing those as well.

Start from the beginning. I researched a lot of music services with paid promotion and i can tell that is 90% scam or bullshit that aint worth it. For example i tried to send mails to some famous youtubers for playlisting, no one answered. I tried to find some real good spotify playlists, that’s 95% scam cause i checked em and other 5% just not about real good results. Also i can buy some press articles but I didn’t saw good enough blogs or magazines who can sell placements, only low traffic. What do we have in here, YouTube ads and ig ads, yea it’s kinda lot of views or coverage but not a lot of followers from it and prices for us, eu, au is crazy, don’t matter what my budget is. And of course we have a lot of submission platforms like submithub but I don’t know nobody that was added after submission on that or same service. Look i have real high quality of sound and music videos, real cool content, i have plan/strategy and it’s working but not so fast tbh very very slowly. Yes Spotify editorial playlists worth it and is 0 dollars to spent but every day is more than 4k tracks uploading on the platform. I didn’t mention everything i tried and how much money i spent. But I don’t think that is right way i move in. Get signed on label is long story i think and they should want to sign you by themselves. But how can i start wit it? Where is right answer? If someone have experience to share, share it pls. I think that can be helpful for people like me. Or we can try collab with somebody from here idk. Maybe right way is to use open mics in my country and share with people visit cards with qr codes with links to my music is better way cause live communication feels much better and i have some results from it.

134fu4r,1682926783.0,beermoneyeasteu,Determinaator,"List of European &amp; Worldwide beermoney opportunities! (studies, testing, offers, surveys, apps) - May 2023","**Introduction**


Having recently gotten into beermoney websites myself I quickly ran into a problem - being located in Eastern Europe it is difficult to find something that actually works. So, I've spent some time and gathered around a fair amount of websites that I personally tested to see if they worked for real or not. These were tried out in Estonia but should work worldwide. It is highly recommended to combine various websites in order to maximize earnings.

Please don't hesitate to share any beermoney websites that you know as well. Be aware that most of these websites require verified **PayPal** in order to process withdrawals, so make sure you have that sorted out. This list is updated whenever a new method is found! 

**Sign-up offers** [can be found in a separate thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyeasteu/comments/ucc83u/signup_bonuses_thread/)

We have launched a dedicated beermoney blog, [BeermoneyGuides](https://beermoneyguides.com/)! It will feature more in-depth guides and reviews for beermoney methods listed here.

**Get-Paid-To (GPT)** 

As the title suggests, ""Get-Paid-To"" websites pay you to do certain tasks. Now there might not be too many surveys available that work, but offers can be well worth doing in my opinion. Take some time to browse around to see what is available (for example, mobile game offers). Once you have found something I recommend to start comparing rates that different GPT websites are offering (for example, game X with offerwall Y is available both on Freecash and Swagbucks, but Freecash has a higher payout for completing the same task). 

Generally the games offered are very grindy but not impossible to complete. Patience is key, make sure to do your research about offered games to see which ones are the easiest.

❌TapCent - extremely high minimum payment threshold, most likely a scam.",14,1.0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyeasteu/comments/134fu4r/list_of_european_worldwide_beermoney/,"List of European & Worldwide beermoney opportunities!

(studies, testing, offers, surveys, apps) - may 2023","**Introduction** Having recently gotten into beermoney websites myself I quickly ran into a problem - being located in Eastern Europe it is difficult to find something that actually works. So, I've spent some time and gathered around a fair amount of websites that I personally tested to see if they worked for real or not. These were tried out in Estonia but should work worldwide. It is highly recommended to combine various websites in order to maximize earnings. Please don't hesitate to share any beermoney websites that you know as well. Be aware that most of these websites require verified **PayPal** in order to process withdrawals, so make sure you have that sorted out. This list is updated whenever a new method is found!  **Sign-up offers** can be found in a separate thread..  ySense, plus has various games and tasks.  TipNano.  MoneySMS  SEAgent.

Now there might not be too many surveys available that work, but offers can be well worth doing in my opinion. Take some time to browse around to see what is available (for example, mobile game offers). Once you have found something I recommend to start comparing rates that different GPT websites are offering (for example, game X with offerwall Y is available both on Freecash and Swagbucks, but Freecash has a higher payout for completing the same task).  Generally the games offered are very grindy but not impossible to complete. Patience is key, make sure to do your research about offered games to see which ones are the easiest.

I've been lucky enough to have received BBC Introducing 'Track of the Week' for the first 3 of my tracks, but the listener count is super low, and I've not had any luck on playlists.

I've pitched my stuff through the Spotify for Artists page (which is a great resource),but I've not had any luck. I've also spent cash on campaigns in SubmitHub, but I've only had 1 placement to a small playlist, and I must have submitted to 50 or so.

12ncu9s,1681581529.0,Songwriting,Big-Association-239,I recommend Yougrow for playlist promotion,"So i just wanted to share with the crowd the good experience I had with a service called Yougrow for promotion. Lest you think I am just a shill, I also share my bad experiences, such as this post from several months ago about how playlist push is terrible (An opinion I still stand by) [https://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriting/comments/veeuse/comment/j2vsw8i/?%2524](https://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriting/comments/veeuse/comment/j2vsw8i/?%2524)

Prior to using yougrow, I used the aforementioned playlist push as well as submithub and groover. The problem with all 3 is they make you go through and pitch yourself to the playlists, and many of their playlists are terrible. So I get so many responses with them from playlisters saying ""your song is great, but doesn't fit my style"" Then why did your algorithms recommend this person to me? And many of the playlists I have got from those services were worthless and gave me a couple dozen streams. And if you're wondering why I particularly think playlist push is a scam and not submithub or groover, it's because of price. The latter 2 charge you a buck or two per send, so not a big deal if you strike out. PP charges hundreds, or thousands depending on the package, and gives you no guarantee you'll get on any playlist. 

Someone actually on here recommended yougrow to me, and it's worked great. For one, after you pay them THEY pitch your song to playlists they think it is a fit for. And you get your money back if they can't get it placed. So I chose their ""starter"" package which was like 67 bucks for 2-6k guaranteed streams. The playlist they got my song on had more than 225,000 likes (or saves or whatever they are) and the song so far has got 25k streams and counting, obviously way more than even what was promised. The song also got a lot of saves which has helped with the spotify algorithms, and I've obtained 135 new followers.

Lest you think I am just a shill, I also share my bad experiences, such as this post from several months ago about how playlist push is terrible (An opinion I still stand by)  Prior to using yougrow, I used the aforementioned playlist push as well as submithub and groover. The problem with all 3 is they make you go through and pitch yourself to the playlists, and many of their playlists are terrible. So I get so many responses with them from playlisters saying ""your song is great, but doesn't fit my style"" Then why did your algorithms recommend this person to me? And many of the playlists I have got from those services were worthless and gave me a couple dozen streams. And if you're wondering why I particularly think playlist push is a scam and not submithub or groover, it's because of price. The latter 2 charge you a buck or two per send, so not a big deal if you strike out. PP charges hundreds, or thousands depending on the package, and gives you no guarantee you'll get on any playlist.  Someone actually on here recommended yougrow to me, and it's worked great. For one, after you pay them THEY pitch your song to playlists they think it is a fit for. And you get your money back if they can't get it placed. So I chose their ""starter"" package which was like 67 bucks for 2-6k guaranteed streams. The playlist they got my song on had more than 225,000 likes (or saves or whatever they are) and the song so far has got 25k streams and counting, obviously way more than even what was promised.

12asv5c,1680545933.0,DistroKidHelpDesk,Exotic-Cod4067,HELP! Some asshole added my song to a botted playlist without my consent and has messed up my streams and stats what can I do?! Feeling incredibly demoralised and need advice going forward!!,"I released my first ever song last week and it had been doing relatively okay (or I was happy with the organic growth of the song anyway) and I had been happy seeing it reach a small amount of people then I checked my stats and the other day and had gone from 100 monthly listeners to 4K monthly listeners in the space of 24 hours and from 350 streams to 5K over 24 hours.

I was throughly confused and alarm bells began going off in my mind so I began looking into where these streams have come from and then I discovered some absolute cunt from [artister.io](https://artister.io/) added me to one of their shitty playlists that is obviously botted despite their claims on their website that they are ""real listeners who are listening in exchange for rewards"" - even if that is true I am still not happy as it has messed up my stats for genuine listeners and then my place in the spotify algorithm.

I have NOT paid for any service from artister and it actually looks like their ""business"" model is to add small artists to a botted playlist to boost streams in the hopes that they email artister to stay on the playlist (which is an extortionate fee!). I have worked so hard trying to organically promote my music and had been getting good results from submithub and intrest from authentic blogs and playlisters getting great feedback as well as running a couple of insta ads, then this stupid cunt adds me to his botted playlist hoping I would be naive enough to buy into their stupid ""Plans"". Thankfully my song was removed and it looks like the dumb playlist is gone too now.

I have contacted spotify to see if they can do anything to roll back my data to what it was before I was added to this stupid playlist and they said that they cant. When reading online I have heard some people say that the best step is possibly to delete my artist profile and start from scratch and re-upload my track and move forward from there, it would be a shame to lose my progress but I would rather lose the small amount I have made rather than have these fake numbers that will potentially massively effect my future growth!

This feels so unfair, I never asked to be featured on this, it feels like some selfish scammer has tried to exploit me but not even tried to scam me well as it is so obvious! It makes me feel embarrassed for people to see those inflated numbers and makes me feel so disingenuous even though I never asked for this!

I am also worried this will get me banned from spotify due to bots being against TOS.

Does anyone have any advice as to what I should do? I am leaning towards one of two things:

1. Delete my artist page and set it up again (can you do this) and re-release the song as well as some other releases I have been working on later on this year, but then whats to say this wont happen again? I will contact spotify/distrokid for more advice about re-releasing
2. I can just accept that my stats are messed up for this month try to hope for the best the algorithm will self correct by next month and hope for the best that this doesn't happen again I will formally send another email alerting spotify that this wasnt our fault!

Freecash has launched a **new $50 giveaway**! [You can participate here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyeasteu/comments/128e0z6/freecash_50_usd_5x10_usd_paypal_giveaway/)

**Introduction**

Having recently gotten into beermoney websites myself I quickly ran into a problem - being located in Eastern Europe it is difficult to find something that actually works. So, I've spent some time and gathered around a fair amount of websites that I personally tested to see if they worked for real or not. These were tried out in Estonia but should work worldwide. It is highly recommended to combine various websites in order to maximize earnings.

Please don't hesitate to share any beermoney websites that you know as well. Be aware that most of these websites require verified **PayPal** in order to process withdrawals, so make sure you have that sorted out. This list is updated whenever a new method is found! 

**Sign-up offers** [can be found in a separate thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyeasteu/comments/ucc83u/signup_bonuses_thread/)

**Get-Paid-To (GPT)** 

As the title suggests, ""Get-Paid-To"" websites pay you to do certain tasks. Now there might not be too many surveys available that work, but offers can be well worth doing in my opinion. Take some time to browse around to see what is available (for example, mobile game offers). Once you have found something I recommend to start comparing rates that different GPT websites are offering (for example, game X with offerwall Y is available both on Freecash and Swagbucks, but Freecash has a higher payout for completing the same task). 

Generally the games offered are very grindy but not impossible to complete. Patience is key, make sure to do your research about offered games to see which ones are the easiest.

120nydt,1679672220.0,musicmarketing,Recent_Childhood9863,Release and Promotion Strategy Opinions (Bass House Song),"Hey Guys. I am planning to self-release a song, which is a bass house / electro house song. So this is a typical EDM-ish, club track. My fanbase is really small, a few followers on Tiktok, Insta, Yt etc. I've showed the idea to many people and groups and people seemed to like it. I need your opinion and advice on my strategies.

So I would use Distrokid, Radio Edit on streaming (Spotify, Apple etc.), Extended Mix can be bought on Beatport. I've done an FX visualizer, and I will make soon music video (basic idea, imitate  to ""play"" the stems in 6-8 videos at once). I am planning to do some mashups with my song. I would also make a lunatic Hardstyle remix just to spice things up. (found a good service, so I would pay for a cover picture also).

Next is promotion. Before the release I wouldn't do much towards the public. After setting the release, first is to use Spotify for Artists for playlists and Apple Music also. Also would try the Spotify campaign, where it boosts the algorhythm for some percentage of income. I would rather send it to people (cold DMs), such as DJs, Music producers and influencers (there are a lot of people with music lists and ""hot or not"" style shorts). I would do some SM content (as everyone, Tiktok, Insta, FB, Youtube). Stuff like behind the scenes, some fun with the hook of the song. Some submissions (for artists, webpages, channels, radioshows). And I would try some paid promotion. Labelradar has some good options for promotion channels (for instance on Youtube). Submithub for some influencers and playlists. Maybe I would try Toneden io also for some stuff (Hypeddit is so expensive). I wouldn't do FB/Insta/Tiktok ads, I think it's not a good idea.

Of course it would be a big minus in money. But I want to start from there. What do you think? Is it a good strategy idea?

11zvacx,1679601266.0,makinghiphop,vicenormalcrafts,"If you want good feedback for your music, invest in professionals","I see most of the rappers here really are hungry for feedback and exposure. And for that, you’ll fall for the trap of paying to sub some washed up rapper’s live stream to hear what they have to say about your music. 

Last night, I had the displeasure of tuning in to a bad stream where they tore everyone down (some of them REALLY good songs, I might add) but gave their own tracks the highest marks. On tiktok I constantly see streams just like this too, and what’s crazy is that artists are paying these washed up nobodies $5 to review their music. Insane.

I’ve been there. This was going on since Ustream in the late 2000s, (and if you’re active in your local scene) or paying to sell tickets at a showcase. It’s just failed “veterans” taking advantage of hungry artists. And it’s disheartening.


Don’t ever subject yourself to being judged by some bitter, failed musicians who just want to push their bad music on you, while making themselves feel better by knocking you down. 


Instead, do this:


- Submithub isn’t perfect. But the artists chat is probably the best feature on there. Share your music, network and get feedback. It’s free.

- Focus on international outlets. They, for some reason, are more accepting and give better feedback than American outlets.

- Use premium outlets. Free credits are cool, but you get what you pay for.

- Have fun with your music. Experiment, don’t worry about what or who may not like it.



My 20+ years of experience have shown me that “Veterans” tend to gatekeep, and they turn into reviewers when they can’t find success. You ever wonder why they still play their lyrical spiritual individual music on these streams? That shows their heart and sense of fun was never in it.


Anyone who’s worked with me on this sub know I’m not like that. I’ve been rapping since 2000. 12 albums, 12 mixtapes dating back to soundclick and I come to these subs to collab, have fun and share my knowledge.

This was going on since Ustream in the late 2000s, (and if you’re active in your local scene) or paying to sell tickets at a showcase. It’s just failed “veterans” taking advantage of hungry artists. And it’s disheartening. Don’t ever subject yourself to being judged by some bitter, failed musicians who just want to push their bad music on you, while making themselves feel better by knocking you down.  Instead, do this  Submithub isn’t perfect. But the artists chat is probably the best feature on there. Share your music, network and get feedback. It’s free.  Focus on international outlets. They, for some reason, are more accepting and give better feedback than American outlets.  Use premium outlets. Free credits are cool, but you get what you pay for.  Have fun with your music. Experiment, don’t worry about what or who may not like it. My 20 years of experience have shown me that “Veterans” tend to gatekeep, and they turn into reviewers when they can’t find success. You ever wonder why they still play their lyrical spiritual individual music on these streams? That shows their heart and sense of fun was never in it. Anyone who’s worked with me on this sub know I’m not like that. I’ve been rapping since 2000. 12 albums, 12 mixtapes dating back to soundclick and I come to these subs to collab, have fun and share my knowledge.  I don’t know much, but if I can teach you to monetize your music and avoid a scam, I will.","i see most of the rappers here really are hungry for feedback and exposure. and for that, you’ll fall for the trap of paying to sub some washed up rapper’s live stream to hear what they have to say about your music.  last night, i had the displeasure of tuning in to a bad stream where they tore everyone down (some of them really good songs, i might add) but gave their own tracks the highest marks. on tiktok i constantly see streams just like this too, and what’s crazy is that artists are paying these washed up nobodies $5 to review their music. insane. i’ve been there. this was going on since ustream in the late 2000s, (and if you’re active in your local scene) or paying to sell tickets at a showcase. it’s just failed “veterans” taking advantage of hungry artists. and it’s disheartening. don’t ever subject yourself to being judged by some bitter, failed musicians who just want to push their bad music on you, while making themselves feel better by knocking you down.  instead, do this  submithub isn’t perfect. but the artists chat is probably the best feature on there. share your music, network and get feedback. it’s free.  focus on international outlets. they, for some reason, are more accepting and give better feedback than american outlets.  use premium outlets. free credits are cool, but you get what you pay for.  have fun with your music. experiment, don’t worry about what or who may not like it. my 20 years of experience have shown me that “veterans” tend to gatekeep, and they turn into reviewers when they can’t find success. you ever wonder why they still play their lyrical spiritual individual music on these streams? that shows their heart and sense of fun was never in it. anyone who’s worked with me on this sub know i’m not like that. i’ve been rapping since 2000. 12 albums, 12 mixtapes dating back to soundclick and i come to these subs to collab, have fun and share my knowledge.  i don’t know much, but if i can teach you to monetize your music and avoid a scam, i will.",11,361

11kzssi,1678196863.0,beermoneyeasteu,Determinaator,Submithub - make money with your Spotify playlists and/or social medias with music,"[Submithub](https://www.submithub.com/by/beermoneyeasteu?ln=et) is a website for playlist curators or individuals with a social media presence who enjoy music and want to earn income by helping promote music that musicians send to them.

Here's how it works:

Playlists

* You have playlist(s).
* People send you songs on SubmitHub.
* You listen to the songs people send you.
* If the song is a free submission (artists get one a day to send to people), you don't get any money. However, it's still a good idea to check them out, keep your activity up, and you may find some good music.
* If the song is a 'premium submission' (i.e., the artist paid SubmitHub to send it to you), you get paid if you accept (and add the songs to your playlist(s)) or decline the songs (and not add them to your playlist). You earn $0.50 per submission, either way.

Socials

* You have an active Instagram or TikTok account.
* People send you songs on SubmitHub.
* You listen to the songs.
* Either you accept the songs (and play them in a TikTok video or Instagram post) or decline to do so. Either way, you get paid $0.50 per premium submission you accept or deny.
* That's it. As long as you have some playlists or social media presence, every day or so, people will send you songs you can listen to, and you'll get paid whether or not you decide to accept it (e.g., add it to a playlist) or deny it (e.g., decide you don't like it enough to add to a playlist).",7,0.83,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyeasteu/comments/11kzssi/submithub_make_money_with_your_spotify_playlists/,Submithub - make money with your Spotify playlists and/or social medias with music,submithub - make money with your spotify playlists and/or social medias with music,"Submithub. * People send you songs on SubmitHub. * You listen to the songs people send you. * If the song is a free submission (artists get one a day to send to people), you don't get any money.

**Introduction**


Having recently gotten into beermoney websites myself I quickly ran into a problem - being located in Eastern Europe it is difficult to find something that actually works. So, I've spent some time and gathered around a fair amount of websites that I personally tested to see if they worked for real or not. These were tried out in Estonia but should work worldwide. It is highly recommended to combine various websites in order to maximize earnings.

Please don't hesitate to share any beermoney websites that you know as well. Be aware that most of these websites require verified **PayPal** in order to process withdrawals, so make sure you have that sorted out. This list is updated whenever a new method is found! 

**Sign-up offers** [can be found in a separate thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyeasteu/comments/ucc83u/signup_bonuses_thread/)

We have launched a dedicated beermoney blog, [BeermoneyGuides](https://beermoneyguides.com/)! It will feature more in-depth guides and reviews for beermoney methods listed here.

**Get-Paid-To (GPT)** 

As the title suggests, ""Get-Paid-To"" websites pay you to do certain tasks. Now there might not be too many surveys available that work, but offers can be well worth doing in my opinion. Take some time to browse around to see what is available (for example, mobile game offers). Once you have found something I recommend to start comparing rates that different GPT websites are offering (for example, game X with offerwall Y is available both on Freecash and Swagbucks, but Freecash has a higher payout for completing the same task). 

Generally the games offered are very grindy but not impossible to complete. Patience is key, make sure to do your research about offered games to see which ones are the easiest.

My dad was a known singer-songwriter, and he was incredibly good. Tragically he was taken from us before I was a year old, so I never got the chance to learn from him personally. Growing up with his music gave me opportunities, like performing at cool venues by the age of 12, 13 years old. 

I always knew I was gonna make it, I just felt it.. I'm not a braggart—but I do have a highly skilled range and once I started flowing raps at 16, it was obvious I had a natural gift for it. I worked on my R&amp;B/Hip-hop career sporadically, but started to take it more seriously around 21 when I recorded my first actual EP in a studio setting. Problem was? I had absolutely no clue how to market it. I still don't. Having kids young didn't exactly help my productivity either, so I kind of stagnated for the past few years. I released another EP, a video.. but no exposure whatsoever. Hahah, I seriously have zero monthly listeners on Spotify -_- I've tried things like submithub, or ""boost"" services to push your music but they all felt like scams or a waste of time. 

I just wish I had someone to help me through all this. My mom wants me to do the kind of music my dad made, so she doesn't really help me with it (despite knowing the industry pretty well.) She suggests I completely change my music and work with rock/country producers she knows, lol. I'm just kind of at a loss, but I really don't want to give up now. I know I could really make it, if I just knew how to get my music out there to people. Or the right people. My brother is insanely talented, makes amazing psychedelic 3D art and music, and has the exact same problem. I wish there was someone to help me through this, and I wish I had more time. 

It feels like that time, my YOUTH is slipping away from me sometimes. I know we all feel like that when reaching the end of our 20s, but I really don't want to give up on my dreams and just become another sad person who regrets their whole life because they gave up and joined a boring career they're not even passionate about. I just want someone to guide me through what I'm doing wrong.

We have launched a dedicated beermoney blog, [BeermoneyGuides](https://beermoneyguides.com/)! It will feature more in-depth guides and reviews for beermoney methods listed here. 

**Introduction**

Having recently gotten into beermoney websites myself I quickly ran into a problem - being located in Eastern Europe it is difficult to find something that actually works. So, I've spent some time and gathered around a fair amount of websites that I personally tested to see if they worked for real or not. These were tried out in Estonia but should work worldwide. It is highly recommended to combine various websites in order to maximize earnings.

Please don't hesitate to share any beermoney websites that you know as well. Be aware that most of these websites require verified **PayPal** in order to process withdrawals, so make sure you have that sorted out. 

This subreddit is updated whenever a new method is found! You can also follow us on Twitter [@beermoneyeasteu](https://twitter.com/beermoneyeasteu) or on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@beermoneyeasteu)

**Sign-up offers** [can be found in a separate thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyeasteu/comments/ucc83u/signup_bonuses_thread/)

**Get-Paid-To (GPT)** 

As the title suggests, ""Get-Paid-To"" websites pay you to do certain tasks. Now there might not be too many surveys available that work, but offers can be well worth doing in my opinion. Take some time to browse around to see what is available (for example, mobile game offers). Once you have found something I recommend to start comparing rates that different GPT websites are offering (for example, game X with offerwall Y is available both on Freecash and Swagbucks, but Freecash has a higher payout for completing the same task). 

Generally the games offered are very grindy but not impossible to complete. Patience is key, make sure to do your research about offered games to see which ones are the easiest.

10o8onq,1675001957.0,melodichardcore,deddeCR,🔎 Looking for MxH bands to fit in my playlist “Melodic Hardcore - New &amp; Classics”,"👋 Hey, guys! As the title says, I’m searching for some new bands to fit in my Spotify Playlist.

At the moment, the playlist has over 3.000 followers and it generates 200-300 monthly plays.

But I receive so few playlist placements requests… I would like to fit more bands ‘cause I know there are tons of people who deserves to be listened to!

So:

🎧 if you’re a MxH fan, feel free to follow the playlist if you enjoy it.

🤘 If you’re in a MxH band, feel free to submit your song to me through SubmitHub or Groover.

Yes, you have to pay for these requests.

I would love to do it for free but I have also other playlists and I spent so much time to listen to some people stuff…

… and I often listen to many inconsistent/low quality sh%t 😂

So, for just 1$, on my side I am able to filter bulls%it from the real music, and on your side you can submit your song and get results you won’t get with classic advertising (especially if I really enjoy the song and if I decide to keep of in playlist for months…!)

Here’s my link guys, hope I could be of any help for you and I hope I can really support the scene.

Take care! 🙂

For example which service do you use? Tips n' tricks? I'm wondering if I should invest some (more) money there for my future releases.

Influencer Marketing for me is: Pitching your tracks to influencers so they use ur track and it gets exposed to their audience.

I tried it on Submithub (about 20€) and got 2 pitches. Both for TikTok. It was about two weeks ago. One vid got 8k and the other one got 81k views until now. The result was ZERO / 0,0000 conversion to any of my socials or spotify.

Edit:

Lessons learned from this thread: 

\- Influencers are not popular here (or at all - I dont know) thats for sure \^\^

\-  don't pay influencers to use your track - apparently there isn't anyone here with a positive experience - thanks for that insight

How it works:

**Playlists**

* You have a playlist(s)
* People send you songs on Submithub.
* You listen to the songs people send you.
* If the song is a free submission (artists get 1 a day to send to ppl), you don't get any $. These are still good to check out though, keeps your activity up and you may find some good music.
* If the song is a 'premium submission' (i.e, the artist paid submithub to send it to you), you get paid if you accept (and add the songs to your playlist(s)) or decline the songs (and not add them to your playlist). You earn $0.50 per submission either way.
* I typically get ~6-8 premium submissions every 2-3 days or so. It will vary depending on your social media size or playlist size. It's also up to you how long you wish to keep the song in the playlist; personally I'd say a month minimum.

**Socials**


* You have an active Instagram or TikTok
* People send you songs on Submithub
* You listen to the songs.
* Either you accept the songs (and play them in a TikTok video, or Instagram post) or you decline to do so. Either way, you get paid $0.50 per premium submission you accept or deny.
* That's it - it's really simple, and so long as you have some playlists or social media presence, you can make some decent beermoney through SubmitHub.

**NEW**: We have launched a dedicated beermoney blog, [BeermoneyGuides](https://beermoneyguides.com/)! It will feature more in-depth guides and reviews for beermoney methods listed here. 

**Introduction**

Having recently gotten into beermoney websites myself I quickly ran into a problem - being located in Eastern Europe it is difficult to find something that actually works. So, I've spent some time and gathered around a fair amount of websites that I personally tested to see if they worked for real or not. These were tried out in Estonia but should work worldwide. It is highly recommended to combine various websites in order to maximize earnings.

Please don't hesitate to share any beermoney websites that you know as well. Be aware that most of these websites require verified **PayPal** in order to process withdrawals, so make sure you have that sorted out. 

This subreddit is updated whenever a new method is found! You can also follow us on Twitter [@beermoneyeasteu](https://twitter.com/beermoneyeasteu) or on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@beermoneyeasteu)

**Get-Paid-To (GPT)** 

As the title suggests, ""Get-Paid-To"" websites pay you to do certain tasks. Now there might not be too many surveys available that work, but offers can be well worth doing in my opinion. Take some time to browse around to see what is available (for example, mobile game offers). Once you have found something I recommend to start comparing rates that different GPT websites are offering (for example, game X with offerwall Y is available both on Freecash and Swagbucks, but Freecash has a higher payout for completing the same task). 

Generally the games offered are very grindy but not impossible to complete. Patience is key, make sure to do your research about offered games to see which ones are the easiest.

zxgb3n,1672250602.0,beermoneyeasteu,Determinaator,Submithub - make money with your Spotify playlists and/or social medias with music,"[Submithub](https://www.submithub.com/by/beermoneyeasteu?ln=et) is a website for playlist curators or folk with a social media presence that enjoy music &amp; want to earn income by helping promote music that musicians send you. 

How it works:

**Playlists**

* You have a playlist(s)
* People send you songs on Submithub.
* You listen to the songs people send you.
* If the song is a free submission (artists get 1 a day to send to ppl), you don't get any $. These are still good to check out though, keeps your activity up and you may find some good music.
* If the song is a 'premium submission' (i.e, the artist paid submithub to send it to you), you get paid if you accept (and add the songs to your playlist(s)) or decline the songs (and not add them to your playlist). You earn $0.50 per submission either way.
* I typically get ~6-8 premium submissions every 2-3 days or so. It will vary depending on your social media size or playlist size. It's also up to you how long you wish to keep the song in the playlist; personally I'd say a month minimum.

**Socials**


* You have an active Instagram or TikTok
* People send you songs on Submithub
* You listen to the songs.
* Either you accept the songs (and play them in a TikTok video, or Instagram post) or you decline to do so. Either way, you get paid $0.50 per premium submission you accept or deny.
* That's it - it's really simple, and so long as you have some playlists or social media presence, you can make some decent beermoney through SubmitHub. Every day or so, people will send you songs you can listen to &amp; you'll get paid whether or not you decide to accept it (e.g add it to a playlist) or deny it (e.g, decide you don't like it enough to add to a playlist).",2,0.76,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyeasteu/comments/zxgb3n/submithub_make_money_with_your_spotify_playlists/,Submithub - make money with your Spotify playlists and/or social medias with music,submithub - make money with your spotify playlists and/or social medias with music,"Submithub * People send you songs on Submithub. * You listen to the songs people send you. * If the song is a free submission (artists get 1 a day to send to ppl), you don't get any $.

zchoul,1670179256.0,truespotify,nick_minieri,"very sudden 4x increase in followers on my spotify artist profile, followed by a purge - is this normal?","Hi! Have a question about some weird activity that happened on my spotify artist profile recently. Up until the beginning of this past November I had steadily been growing an organic following on my artist page to around 250 followers. Then this huge spike began where I started getting anywhere from 10-25 followers a day until peaking around 700. I figured this wasn't natural at all and these new followers would be purged. And surely enough, I've lost about 100 each day over the last 3 days.

My main question is, are these sudden random increases in followers normal? I've never paid to get on any playlists or tried gaming the system in any way, outside running FB/IG ads and submithub. I've had really good organic growth this year, but nothing that would warrant an immediate 4x increase in followers. Just want to make sure I'm not doing anything that violates the terms and conditions.

***

**NEW**: We have launched a dedicated beermoney blog, [BeermoneyGuides](https://beermoneyguides.com/)! It will feature more in-depth guides and reviews for beermoney methods listed here. 

**Introduction**

Having recently gotten into beermoney websites myself I quickly ran into a problem - being located in Eastern Europe it is difficult to find something that actually works. So, I've spent some time and gathered around a fair amount of websites that I personally tested to see if they worked for real or not. These were tried out in Estonia but should work worldwide. It is highly recommended to combine various websites in order to maximize earnings.

Please don't hesitate to share any beermoney websites that you know as well. Be aware that most of these websites require verified **PayPal** in order to process withdrawals, so make sure you have that sorted out. 

This subreddit is updated whenever a new method is found! You can also follow us on Twitter [@beermoneyeasteu](https://twitter.com/beermoneyeasteu) or on our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/beermoneyeasteu)

**Sign-up offers** [can be found in a separate thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyeasteu/comments/ucc83u/signup_bonuses_thread/)

**Get-Paid-To (GPT)** 

As the title suggests, ""Get-Paid-To"" websites pay you to do certain tasks. Now there might not be too many surveys available that work, but offers can be well worth doing in my opinion. Take some time to browse around to see what is available (for example, mobile game offers). Once you have found something I recommend to start comparing rates that different GPT websites are offering (for example, game X with offerwall Y is available both on Freecash and Swagbucks, but Freecash has a higher payout for completing the same task). 

Generally the games offered are very grindy but not impossible to complete. Patience is key, make sure to do your research about offered games to see which ones are the easiest.

Website | Description
---|---
[Freecash](https://freecash.com/r/101362071091516701237)|Includes various games, offers, tasks and surveys. **Probably the best paying GPT site at the current moment!**

[Lootup](https://lootup.me?refer=3337347)|Games, offers, tasks, surveys. **Third best GPT website, use in combination with [Loot.tv](https://loot.tv) + [Hideout](https://hideout.co/viewerSignup.php?refer=3337347) for passive earning!**

So I just released my debut LP and I'm struggling with choosing songs to pitch to curators. I've submitted basically all of my songs SubmitHub's ""Hot or Not"" section to see which ones performed the best but, after 50 plays each,  they're all close enough in terms of ratings so as not to really have a clear ""winner"".

So I thought about perhaps choosing a handful of curators (who I think will like my music, of course) and just throwing everything out there (as far as my budget will allow) and seeing which ones, if any, get accepted.

Is this a dumb idea? What if, on the very slim chance, one of the curators likes more than one song? Will they add both to their playlist? Write a review of both on their blog, etc.

My ultimate goal is to promote my LP as a whole, so any suggestions on how to get that kind of coverage would be amazing. Or if there are better ways/services out there to help me determine which songs are strongest.

TL;DR - New LP, can't determine which songs to pitch. Should I try sending a bunch of songs to a few curators? Any services or ways to determine which songs on my album are the strongest?

How it works:

**Playlists**

* You have a playlist(s)
* People send you songs on Submithub.
* You listen to the songs people send you.
* If the song is a free submission (artists get 1 a day to send to ppl), you don't get any $. These are still good to check out though, keeps your activity up and you may find some good music.
* If the song is a 'premium submission' (i.e, the artist paid submithub to send it to you), you get paid if you accept (and add the songs to your playlist(s)) or decline the songs (and not add them to your playlist). You earn $0.50 per submission either way.
* I typically get ~6-8 premium submissions every 2-3 days or so. It will vary depending on your social media size or playlist size. It's also up to you how long you wish to keep the song in the playlist; personally I'd say a month minimum.

**Socials**


* You have an active Instagram or TikTok
* People send you songs on Submithub
* You listen to the songs.
* Either you accept the songs (and play them in a TikTok video, or Instagram post) or you decline to do so. Either way, you get paid $0.50 per premium submission you accept or deny.

[Click here to find out more information on how to participate.](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyeasteu/comments/z11obt/freecash_500000_world_cup_event/) 

***

**NEW**: We have launched a dedicated beermoney blog, [BeermoneyGuides](https://beermoneyguides.com/)! It will feature more in-depth guides and reviews for beermoney methods listed here. 

**Introduction**

Having recently gotten into beermoney websites myself I quickly ran into a problem - being located in Eastern Europe it is difficult to find something that actually works. So, I've spent some time and gathered around a fair amount of websites that I personally tested to see if they worked for real or not. These were tried out in Estonia but should work worldwide. It is highly recommended to combine various websites in order to maximize earnings.

Please don't hesitate to share any beermoney websites that you know as well. Be aware that most of these websites require verified **PayPal** in order to process withdrawals, so make sure you have that sorted out. 

This subreddit is updated whenever a new method is found! You can also follow us on Twitter [@beermoneyeasteu](https://twitter.com/beermoneyeasteu) or on our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/beermoneyeasteu)

**Sign-up offers** [can be found in a separate thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyeasteu/comments/ucc83u/signup_bonuses_thread/)

**Get-Paid-To (GPT)** 

As the title suggests, ""Get-Paid-To"" websites pay you to do certain tasks. Now there might not be too many surveys available that work, but offers can be well worth doing in my opinion. Take some time to browse around to see what is available (for example, mobile game offers). Once you have found something I recommend to start comparing rates that different GPT websites are offering (for example, game X with offerwall Y is available both on Freecash and Swagbucks, but Freecash has a higher payout for completing the same task). 

Generally the games offered are very grindy but not impossible to complete. Patience is key, make sure to do your research about offered games to see which ones are the easiest.

Website | Description
---|---
[Freecash](https://freecash.com/r/101362071091516701237)|Includes various games, offers, tasks and surveys. **Probably the best paying GPT site at the current moment!**

[Lootup](https://lootup.me?refer=3337347)|Games, offers, tasks, surveys. **Third best GPT website, use in combination with [Loot.tv](https://loot.tv) + [Hideout](https://hideout.co/viewerSignup.php?refer=3337347) for passive earning!**

Once you have found something I recommend to start comparing rates that different GPT websites are offering (for example, game X with offerwall Y is available both on Freecash and Swagbucks, but Freecash has a higher payout for completing the same task).

17npyd1,1699117066.0,MusicPromotion,TannerCordiak,Everything I have done for promotion,"I am going to list all of the things I have done for promo of my new single ""Oh Kristen"" that came out yesterday. I will check back in a month and let you know how it is going!

&amp;#x200B;

1. I had everything planned two months before. I have planned and planned and planned. I made the commitment to take this seriously. When I am not at work this is part of all I am doing and the rest is music career related as well. I have an outline - things to do before release. At release. After release. Lastly Maintenance.
2. Submit hub, submitted to alooottttt of playlists - got accepted into 4, and a blog post, and a instagram share
3. groover - got accepted into a couple playlists/blog posts - submitted to so many over time.
4. I saved over the past year with a savings purely for my music career. I am not well off, I am good at acting though lol. I paid a real PR company 1500 dollars for YouTube ads and tiktok promotion. I did extensive research to find real companies - do your research. Before anyone says ""well good for you, I do not have 1500 to spare"" I have been saving little by little every paycheck, that is just what I have done not what you ""should"" do. I made sure to not leave anything to last minute
5. Used saved money for instagram, Facebook, and tiktok ads. Tiktok ads have made me question their legitimacy. It all seems fake which is really weird to me. Instagram ads have been hit or miss, one of them showed me that they are legit when they work well. I paid very very little for these, duration 3-5 days
6. Asked every single person in my contacts to share my instagram post about my release when it released. I had about 13-15 people do it. I sent it to about 50. Welcome hahaha
7. I spent 40 dollars on an app called TSX where 15 seconds of a silent video will show in Times Square at a certain time slot. I spent 240 dollars, and honestly who knows if that was worth it at ALL haha but you know what it was really fun to see me up there. It got me really excited
8. List of indie artists I like, big artists that are low-key super on the sidelines these days to message on instagram ( my song was released yesterday so I will keep y'all updated )
9. When the blog posts are available, and since I made sure to make an official page/user account on every social media possible - I have a draft for a Wikipedia page ready. The reason for this is that the more information that is available about you as a music artist the higher chance google will create the official artist info panel when you google yourself. That panel happens automatically
10. I went to 7 apple stores and pulled up my song on a bunch of devices lol
11. This one is a bit icky... I made a raya account and updated all my info and pics to reflect me as a music artists - then used it for networking which has actually been really cool. However, I only liked peoples profiles that had to do with the music industry. Each person that did have to do with it. EH
12. Scoured the internet for emails to anyone that could help me out in the industry. Sent about 200 emails. Only 5 replies most were denied emails going through from security on their end. Got in touch with a possible manager here in NY
13. Creating an IMDB for my music video - hoping to add it as ammo for the google artist panel when name is googled
14. this should have come earlier but I knew I needed GOOD visuals. And that I wanted to do a true PERFORMANCE in my video. I have worked my butt off to meet and create an artistic community around me - I have severe social anxiety and knew that I was going to need help creating things one day and so I pushed through it which was a whole process. Anyways, I asked all of these people if they would help me create a music video for free - asking in a way of like hey I do not have money I believe in paying artists but I am curious if you listen to this song of mine, if you believe in it enough or whatever would you want to be involved? They all said yes. We filmed a 12 hour day at cony island - here is the result  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72CxKJkRqzk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72CxKJkRqzk)
15. I want to look as legit as possible. I used Symphonic music video distribution and they created a VEVO for me, I spent an hour designing my LINKTREE hahaha
16. I had photos taken of me a few times. It was necessary for me to have a variety of things to choose from so I don't have to keep posting the same thing, that gets boring for people
17. I found a website that analyzes your audio and suggests like possible target audience and genres and similar artists - I did it a long time ago and can't find it but can let you guys know if you want

&amp;#x200B;

That is all I have in me to write for now. I find a lot of comfort knowing that if I did this for a single, that I would do so much for for an EP, and sooo much more for an album. This is a life long thing - I have to think of it like that. I am sorry if some of these aren't full promo but yeah anyways I hope this helped someone at least with ideas maybe.

&amp;#x200B;

In the end of the day, I know that one can do all the promo in the world and people still do not choose to engage/listen/support. But this is just what I have done. I will post in one month and see if anything did anything!

Submit hub, submitted to alooottttt of playlists - got accepted into 4, and a blog post, and a instagram share  3. groover - got accepted into a couple playlists/blog posts - submitted to so many over time. 4. I saved over the past year with a savings purely for my music career. I am not well off, I am good at acting though lol. I paid a real PR company 1500 dollars for YouTube ads and tiktok promotion. I did extensive research to find real companies - do your research. Before anyone says ""well good for you, I do not have 1500 to spare"" I have been saving little by little every paycheck, that is just what I have done not what you ""should"" do. I made sure to not leave anything to last minute  5. Used saved money for instagram, Facebook, and tiktok ads. Tiktok ads have made me question their legitimacy. It all seems fake which is really weird to me. Instagram ads have been hit or miss, one of them showed me that they are legit when they work well. I paid very very little for these, duration 3-5 days 6. Asked every single person in my contacts to share my instagram post about my release when it released. I had about 13-15 people do it. I sent it to about 50. Welcome hahaha 7. I spent 40 dollars on an app called TSX where 15 seconds of a silent video will show in Times Square at a certain time slot. I spent 240 dollars, and honestly who knows if that was worth it at ALL haha but you know what it was really fun to see me up there. It got me really excited 8. List of indie artists I like, big artists that are low-key super on the sidelines these days to message on instagram ( my song was released yesterday so I will keep y'all updated ) 9. When the blog posts are available, and since I made sure to make an official page/user account on every social media possible - I have a draft for a Wikipedia page ready. The reason for this is that the more information that is available about you as a music artist the higher chance google will create the official artist info panel when you google yourself. That panel happens automatically  10. I went to 7 apple stores and pulled up my song on a bunch of devices lol 11. This one is a bit icky... I made a raya account and updated all my info and pics to reflect me as a music artists - then used it for networking which has actually been really cool. However, I only liked peoples profiles that had to do with the music industry. Each person that did have to do with it. EH  12. Scoured the internet for emails to anyone that could help me out in the industry. Sent about 200 emails. Only 5 replies most were denied emails going through from security on their end. Got in touch with a possible manager here in NY  13. Creating an IMDB for my music video - hoping to add it as ammo for the google artist panel when name is googled  14. this should have come earlier but I knew I needed GOOD visuals. And that I wanted to do a true PERFORMANCE in my video. I have worked my butt off to meet and create an artistic community around me - I have severe social anxiety and knew that I was going to need help creating things one day and so I pushed through it which was a whole process. Anyways, I asked all of these people if they would help me create a music video for free - asking in a way of like hey I do not have money I believe in paying artists but I am curious if you listen to this song of mine, if you believe in it enough or whatever would you want to be involved? They all said yes. We filmed a 12 hour day at cony island - here is the result    15. I want to look as legit as possible. I used Symphonic music video distribution and they created a VEVO for me, I spent an hour designing my LINKTREE hahaha 16. I had photos taken of me a few times. It was necessary for me to have a variety of things to choose from so I don't have to keep posting the same thing, that gets boring for people  17. I found a website that analyzes your audio and suggests like possible target audience and genres and similar artists - I did it a long time ago and can't find it but can let you guys know if you want  &x200B; That is all I have in me to write for now. I find a lot of comfort knowing that if I did this for a single, that I would do so much for for an EP, and sooo much more for an album. This is a life long thing - I have to think of it like that. I am sorry if some of these aren't full promo but yeah anyways I hope this helped someone at least with ideas maybe. &x200B; In the end of the day, I know that one can do all the promo in the world and people still do not choose to engage/listen/support.

How it works:

**Playlists**

* You have a playlist(s)
* People send you songs on Submithub.
* You listen to the songs people send you.
* If the song is a free submission (artists get 1 a day to send to ppl), you don't get any $. These are still good to check out though, keeps your activity up and you may find some good music.
* If the song is a 'premium submission' (i.e, the artist paid submithub to send it to you), you get paid if you accept (and add the songs to your playlist(s)) or decline the songs (and not add them to your playlist). You earn $0.50 per submission either way.
* I typically get ~6-8 premium submissions every 2-3 days or so. It will vary depending on your social media size or playlist size. It's also up to you how long you wish to keep the song in the playlist; personally I'd say a month minimum.

**Socials**


* You have an active Instagram or TikTok
* People send you songs on Submithub
* You listen to the songs.
* Either you accept the songs (and play them in a TikTok video, or Instagram post) or you decline to do so. Either way, you get paid $0.50 per premium submission you accept or deny.
* That's it - it's really simple, and so long as you have some playlists or social media presence, you can make some decent beermoney through SubmitHub. Every day or so, people will send you songs you can listen to &amp; you'll get paid whether or not you decide to accept it (e.g add it to a playlist) or deny it (e.g, decide you don't like it enough to add to a playlist).",2,0.76,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyeasteu/comments/yhmnqt/submithub_make_money_with_your_spotify_playlists/,Submithub - make money with your Spotify playlists and/or social medias with music,submithub - make money with your spotify playlists and/or social medias with music,"Submithub * People send you songs on Submithub. * You listen to the songs people send you. * If the song is a free submission (artists get 1 a day to send to ppl), you don't get any $.

I just submitted my song that I got 2,500 streams and 15 playlist/2 blog write ups using SubmitHub in the first month spending about $100 on SubmitHub submissions (47 recipients) 

MySphera claims to be $29.99 for a month long campaign. 

I will report back with the results.

I've heard bad feedback about MySphera - apparently their customer service is very poor and the artist telling me this felt the whole thing was built to grab money, rather than help artists. (Yes, I know all sites try to make money, but some are sincere about trying to help). So, feedback would be great. 

I've been using Submit.hub. 20% approval rate, which I think is around average. 

Genre of music seems to be a big factor in getting positive responses. Most popular songs fall into the EDM / HipHop and Lo-fi genres. Also, choosing a genre that suits the SONG and not necessarily the ARTIST.

We're running national press &amp;amp; radio campaigns simultaneously. So far, Submit.hub, Sound Campaign and Facebook advertising are driving the majority of Spotify plays. However, this illuminates the nature of audience building, which is seeding, joining the dots, following up every lead and connecting with fans.

Even with professional PR and marketing, music marketing is a long, slow, meticulous process.",1,1.0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SummaryLab/comments/ydrpdp/summary_anybody_ever_use_mysphera_rmusicmarketing/,Summary Anybody ever use MySphera? r/musicmarketing,summary anybody ever use mysphera? r/musicmarketing," **Anybody ever use MySphera?** I just submitted my song that I got 2,500 streams and 15 playlist/2 blog write ups usin... **Summary** Summary of original post  The author is asking if anyone has used the music marketing service MySphera, and they share their experience using SubmitHub.

ybla4r,1666540628.0,beermoneyeasteu,Determinaator,Submithub - make money with your Spotify playlists and/or social medias with music,"[Submithub](https://www.submithub.com/by/beermoneyeasteu?ln=et) is a website for playlist curators or folk with a social media presence that enjoy music &amp; want to earn income by helping promote music that musicians send you. 

How it works:

**Playlists**

* You have a playlist(s)
* People send you songs on Submithub.
* You listen to the songs people send you.
* If the song is a free submission (artists get 1 a day to send to ppl), you don't get any $. These are still good to check out though, keeps your activity up and you may find some good music.
* If the song is a 'premium submission' (i.e, the artist paid submithub to send it to you), you get paid if you accept (and add the songs to your playlist(s)) or decline the songs (and not add them to your playlist). You earn $0.50 per submission either way.
* I typically get ~6-8 premium submissions every 2-3 days or so. It will vary depending on your social media size or playlist size. It's also up to you how long you wish to keep the song in the playlist; personally I'd say a month minimum.

**Socials**


* You have an active Instagram or TikTok
* People send you songs on Submithub
* You listen to the songs.
* Either you accept the songs (and play them in a TikTok video, or Instagram post) or you decline to do so. Either way, you get paid $0.50 per premium submission you accept or deny.
* That's it - it's really simple, and so long as you have some playlists or social media presence, you can make some decent beermoney through SubmitHub. Every day or so, people will send you songs you can listen to &amp; you'll get paid whether or not you decide to accept it (e.g add it to a playlist) or deny it (e.g, decide you don't like it enough to add to a playlist).",2,0.67,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyeasteu/comments/ybla4r/submithub_make_money_with_your_spotify_playlists/,Submithub - make money with your Spotify playlists and/or social medias with music,submithub - make money with your spotify playlists and/or social medias with music,"Submithub * People send you songs on Submithub. * You listen to the songs people send you. * If the song is a free submission (artists get 1 a day to send to ppl), you don't get any $.

xywrhk,1665245941.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,EdinKaso,"I got 10,000 monthly listeners in under 3 months with no label, team, or money. Here’s what I learned.","This is not a promotional post so I will not be posting any links. Rather, I want to focus on the invaluable lessons I’ve learned and what helped me in this short but eventful time.

Just a disclaimer: I am not a professional and do not work in the industry, but these are the things I’ve found really helped me.

**1. Hold your music to a professional standard and keep trying to improve.**

No matter what genre you’re in, you want to ask yourself “Do I see this being played on the radio?”. I’m personally always trying to improve, and even though my music has been very positively received, I still feel like there’s so much to improve in everything (which I came to realize is a good thing. Because it means you’ll keep improving).


**2. Network with others.** 

I see a lot of people making amazing music but just keeping to themselves in their little bubble. There’s nothing wrong with that, but if you are trying to grow your listeners…you’re honestly missing a huge opportunity. Networking allows you to reach so many people who would enjoy your music. It helps you to get into playlists, it helps you to get more fans, and just helps with exposure in general. Side note: never pay for any promotional service or to get more listeners!


**3. Know your audience.**

You could be the most amazing classical composer in the world, but if you’re sharing your music with Gen Z or Alpha, no one will care. Find your audience. And going back to point 2, networking helps with this too.


**4. Accept this fact “No one cares until everyone does.”**

This was a truth that hit me hard. I worked so hard on my first release back in July, and when I released it…no one cared, including most of my social circle. But I realized this: “no one cares until everyone does”. This actually ended up being a comforting thought. What it means is you could be making the most beautiful music in the world, and most people still won’t appreciate it, until there’s social validation or social proof. Until they see others liking and listening to your music. It’s kind of a sad truth about human nature but…you can actually leverage this to your advantage. Whatever milestone you reach, share it and use social media to show “social proof”.


**5. Know your music theory.**

This is absolutely fundamental. Learn and really understand this. Don’t learn it for the sake of memorizing, but learn it and see how it applies to real music. Learn it to apply it. A lot of people will say “but (insert artist) never learned theory”. The truth is these people never learned conventional music theory, but they still understood music theory in their own unique way. They don’t just sit down and make music without understanding the patterns and connections in music.


**6. It takes a lot of time before you become good.**

To the outside world, I just started making music 3 months ago. But what most people don’t see is the thousands of hours I’ve invested beforehand. I started learning instruments at the age of 12. I started making music in my teens. In my early 20s I put in thousands upon thousands of hours into properly learning theory and technique (I’m a pianist). And at the age of 27 now people say my music is “professional”.


There are so many more things I would like to share that have helped me, but this post is already getting too long haha. But I really hope this helps. I wish you guys all the best in your music goals!

Edit: I just want to add, some people have brought up that I might be paying for playlists (or botting streams). I never have and never will do such things. Only thing I have experimented with is submithub, which is pay for consideration.

Think about this:
Why would any sane artist who takes a lot of pride in their work want to ever compromise to such things that can get them banned? To destroy all their hard work? Especially when they know their music is good enough for real ears? And why would any artist who takes pride in their work want fake listeners? You can listen to my music itself and tell that I put a lot of love and care, and take pride in it.

I’d take 1 real listener and fan over 1000 bots any day.

**Introduction**

Having recently gotten into beermoney websites myself I quickly ran into a problem - being located in Eastern Europe it is difficult to find something that actually works. So, I've spent some time and gathered around a fair amount of websites that I personally tested to see if they worked for real or not. These were tried out in Estonia but should work worldwide. It is highly recommended to combine various websites in order to maximize earnings.

Please don't hesitate to share any beermoney websites that you know as well. Be aware that most of these websites require verified **PayPal** in order to process withdrawals, so make sure you have that sorted out. 

This subreddit is updated whenever a new method is found! You can also follow us on Twitter [@beermoneyeasteu](https://twitter.com/beermoneyeasteu) or on our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/beermoneyeasteu)

**Get-Paid-To (GPT)** 

As the title suggests, ""Get-Paid-To"" websites pay you to do certain tasks. Now there might not be too many surveys available that work, but offers can be well worth doing in my opinion. Take some time to browse around to see what is available (for example, mobile game offers). Once you have found something I recommend to start comparing rates that different GPT websites are offering (for example, game X with offerwall Y is available both on Freecash and Swagbucks, but Freecash has a higher payout for completing the same task). 

Generally the games offered are very grindy but not impossible to complete. Patience is key, make sure to do your research about offered games to see which ones are the easiest.

I'm not sure even delaying your release to pitch to Spotify is worth it because they get 60,000 new releases daily and I can't imagine how they could possibly have the time for new artists. I think I would rather just have the song out there asap.

So I'm about to release my debut single, it's a dream-pop song with lot's of synths and vocal harmonies.

I have a 1000$ budget per each single that I'm about to release and I'm thinking of how to use them.

What I currently did:

\-Set a release through Distrokid, 3 weeks ahead of time, to all platforms, mainly so I could get on Spotify's playlists.

\-Put about 20 credits on Submithub - currently got 7 declines out of 20\~

\-Planning on a FB/IG campaign that will lead to Spotify listens (Not sure how to go about this one yet).

\-Used PlaylistSupply to make a list of applicable playlists to send to after the single's release.

\-Release date is Friday - 9.23.22.

I have two more singles to drop prior to the EP.

What would you recommend me doing? I'm open to suggestions and approaches.

xasbls,1662824208.0,musicians,RenegadeAngel2020,Is this the most effective way to promote yourself?,"What do you think is the best way to promote yourself to get more followers? I think posting o Reddit or Facebook threads has not yielded very much, neither on sites like Submithub (even if you get on tons of blogs and playlists). 

I think the best way to grow fanbase is through Facebook ads since it lets you target people. You can for instance target people who both like  ""independent artists"" (who like to discover new music), your music genre  and some artists you sound like. This gives a huge real boost and following. People will add yourself to their playlists and other will  take it from there. Our song 'Journey into Madness' did get on a few hundred playlists that are a perfect fit for our genre and tons of followers  and reaching about 20 000 plays on Spotify! No need to pitch to playlisters who do very seldom have a great playlist that fits your music. It is also likely many of these ""huge playlists"" have mostly bots that follow and stream these songs!

Facebook Ads is also very cheap. We  haven gotten contacted by some decent labels too, but they tend to want  you invest a big budget ($1500) for EP release, but that includes them printing out 1000 cds that they send out as promo. However, most of  these artists have much less listeners, followers, radio plays and such than us,  so have opted out to be ""semi-independent"" (smaller label: Inverse  Records)

Did try out Youtube ads for the Spanish version of the song and it got 50 000+ views. However, for  some very odd reason this song started to play on childrens show even if  you could target ""metalheads"" (you can see what videos your ads is  played on in Googles stats) and engagement was pretty poor.  However,  when it worked properly it was pretty great too.

We have now let the record label do all promoting,but also uploaded the song to our own Youtube Channel and done no paid promo and not that  active promo of it (some posts here and there) and have gotten about  1000 views in 2 weeks. So, I guess we at least some ""real followers"" :) Here is the  newest song: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szMib96YOS8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szMib96YOS8) . If you like traditonal heavy metal with some elements of power metal then you might want to check it out. Gotten mostly 3 and 4 out of 5 stars reviews in most ""major magazines for our genre"", so I guess most think it does not completely suck...haha. However, there are of course haters and people who love it.

I just want to share my new single to you: [https://open.spotify.com/track/7hVFm3yzEgujWmSBv8e6Ff?si=4cc399dbd75442d7](https://open.spotify.com/track/7hVFm3yzEgujWmSBv8e6Ff?si=4cc399dbd75442d7)

I've received a lot of positive feedback on Submithub, so, I hope you will like that. It's #electronicore / #groovemetal track with some positive energy. It's very close to soundtracks of action video games or movies, so, if you like that - I sware you will like **RMSHN - HDBNGR.**

Also I'm open for **any collaboration**, especially with vocalists and electronic musicians. We can make new versions of this song, we can work on new material. You don't need to pay anything for mixing/mastering etc, just record your part. Everything about managing, distribution etc is on my side.

I'll be happy to get **any recommendations of playlists** where I can send my track. I already did everything that I could with Submithub and Groover, so, if you have any contacts, links etc that are not discivered there - I will appreciate that.

I've made **my own playlists** and one of them started to grow organically, so, I'm very happy about that!  
If you have something that will fit in it good - send it to me.

x2zdq7,1662010497.0,beermoneyeasteu,Determinaator,"List of European &amp; Worldwide beermoney opportunities! (studies, testing, offers, surveys, apps) - September 2022","**Introduction**

Having recently gotten into beermoney websites myself I quickly ran into a problem - being located in Eastern Europe it is difficult to find something that actually works. So, I've spent some time and gathered around a fair amount of websites that I personally tested to see if they worked for real or not. These were tried out in Estonia but should work worldwide. It is highly recommended to combine various websites in order to maximize earnings.

Please don't hesitate to share any beermoney websites that you know as well. Be aware that most of these websites require verified **PayPal** in order to process withdrawals, so make sure you have that sorted out. 

This subreddit is updated whenever a new method is found! You can also follow us on Twitter [@beermoneyeasteu](https://twitter.com/beermoneyeasteu)

**Get-Paid-To (GPT)** 

As the title suggests, ""Get-Paid-To"" websites pay you to do certain tasks. Now there might not be too many surveys available that work, but offers can be well worth doing in my opinion. Take some time to browse around to see what is available (for example, mobile game offers). Once you have found something I recommend to start comparing rates that different GPT websites are offering (for example, game X with offerwall Y is available both on Freecash and Swagbucks, but Freecash has a higher payout for completing the same task). 

Generally the games offered are very grindy but not impossible to complete. Patience is key, make sure to do your research about offered games to see which ones are the easiest.

Website | Description
---|---
[Freecash](https://freecash.com/r/101362071091516701237)|Includes various games, offers, tasks and surveys. **Probably the best paying GPT site at the current moment!**

[Lootup](https://lootup.me?refer=3337347)|Games, offers, tasks, surveys. **Third best GPT website, use in combination with [Loot.tv](https://loot.tv) + [Hideout](https://hideout.co/viewerSignup.php?refer=3337347) for passive earning!**

How it works:

**Playlists**

* You have a playlist(s)
* People send you songs on Submithub.
* You listen to the songs people send you.
* If the song is a free submission (artists get 1 a day to send to ppl), you don't get any $. These are still good to check out though, keeps your activity up and you may find some good music.
* If the song is a 'premium submission' (i.e, the artist paid submithub to send it to you), you get paid if you accept (and add the songs to your playlist(s)) or decline the songs (and not add them to your playlist). You earn $0.50 per submission either way.
* I typically get ~6-8 premium submissions every 2-3 days or so. It will vary depending on your social media size or playlist size. It's also up to you how long you wish to keep the song in the playlist; personally I'd say a month minimum.

**Socials**


* You have an active Instagram or TikTok
* People send you songs on Submithub
* You listen to the songs.
* Either you accept the songs (and play them in a TikTok video, or Instagram post) or you decline to do so. Either way, you get paid $0.50 per premium submission you accept or deny.
* That's it - it's really simple, and so long as you have some playlists or social media presence, you can make some decent beermoney through SubmitHub. Every day or so, people will send you songs you can listen to &amp; you'll get paid whether or not you decide to accept it (e.g add it to a playlist) or deny it (e.g, decide you don't like it enough to add to a playlist).",1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/beermoneyeasteu/comments/wq1xhe/submithub_make_money_with_your_spotify_playlists/,Submithub - make money with your Spotify playlists and/or social medias with music,submithub - make money with your spotify playlists and/or social medias with music,"Submithub * People send you songs on Submithub. * You listen to the songs people send you. * If the song is a free submission (artists get 1 a day to send to ppl), you don't get any $.

##### **Info**

* **Minimum cashout**: $10 (I've made ~$250 total since October 2021, [some recent payments](https://i.imgur.com/L1onPei.png))
* **Payment options**: PayPal, Bank Transfer, or Submithub credits (used for promoting songs)
* **What Do You Do?**: curate playlists, or promote songs on your social medias, blogs, radio stations, etc. So long as you have at least 1 playlist that fits the minimum requirements, you can also benefit from smaller ones.


-
* **Minimum requirements below (only need to fit one of these):**
  * [Influencer](https://img.submithub.com/images/original/pYFaz8SjvGedWzv3m/1-3thkawupegwo0f2zs3fhlw-1613372487790.png): At least 5,000 followers with frequent sharing and good engagement (typically Instagram)

##### **How Do You Sign Up?**

Use my referral https://www.submithub.com/by/madbrad200 - I get $5 for every 10 premium submissions you accept (up to $50)  
Or use this **non-referral** link: https://www.submithub.com/apply

As far as I can tell, there is no referral bonus for people who use the referral link, so up to you which you wanna use.

Once Submithub accept you (if you meet their playlist/social media requirements), you'll start to have musicians send you their songs &amp; once that begins, you'll be able to start earning some $. The amount of $ you earn will depend on the size of your playlists or social media presence - the bigger, the more music you get sent, the more $ you make.

---

##### **How Do You Grow Your Playlists?**

If you're playlisting songs, you benefit the most from Submithub if you have active, followed playlists, so growing them is important. Once they hit a certain size, they tend to grow organically on their own but some ideas (obviously, never spam):

1. Post in relevant subreddits/threads. I've seen playlists go viral by doing this well.
2. Use [subreddits specifically dedicated](https://www.reddit.com/user/madbrad200/m/playlists/) to promoting playlists.
3. Plug your playlists in forums, discords, make social media posts about them, etc. 
4. Pay for google/facebook/Spotify/etc ads to promote your playlists. Big curators tend to do this.

I believe there are also techniques you can use to help boost your playlists in searches, e.g not playlisting too many songs from the same artist, regularly updating the playlist, etc. I honestly don't min-max this as much as I could and I do fine, so.

Most curators, including myself, *only accept a very small amount of submissions* ([see my stats](https://i.imgur.com/2OI0Pdo.png)). Of course, it's all up to you what you accept or deny, but my point is that there's no incentive to ONLY accept music to get $. You get paid regardless. It's down to what YOU enjoy.

---

##### **Who Should Consider Using Submithub?**

* People who enjoy music
* People who enjoy curating playlists OR have a social media presence &amp; like to use music in your posts
* People who build legitimate playlists with legitimate followings - you won't get paid by botting your playlists for followers and having 0 actual listeners. Seriously... it's obvious when people do this, and doesn't help anyone. You will get booted.
* Anyone from casual music curators (like me) to professional radio DJ's can do this. The barrier to entry is very small - but if you don't enjoy listening to new music, this won't be for you.
* People who already maintain playlists and/or have a social media following (that meet the minimum requirements listed at the top of this post)

wpyhap,1660666711.0,beermoneyAus,Madbrad200,Submithub - guide on making money with your Spotify playlists and/or social medias with music,"##### **What Is It?**

Submithub is a **website for playlist curators** or **folk with a social media presence** that enjoy music &amp; want to earn some $ by helping promote music that musicians send you.

**Playlists**

1. You have a playlist(s)
2. People send you songs on Submithub.
3. You listen to the songs people send you.
4. If the song is a free submission (artists get 1 a day to send to ppl), you don't get any $. These are still good to check out though, keeps your activity up and you may find some good music.
5. If the song is a 'premium submission' (i.e, the artist paid submithub to send it to you), you get paid if you accept (and add the songs to your playlist(s)) or decline the songs (and not add them to your playlist). You earn $0.50 per submission either way.

I typically get ~6-8 premium submissions every 2-3 days or so. It will vary depending on your social media size or playlist size. It's also up to you how long you wish to keep the song in the playlist; personally I'd say a month minimum.

**Socials**

Or you can get paid via social media:

1. You have an active Instagram or TikTok
2. People send you songs on Submithub
3. You listen to the songs.
4. Either you accept the songs (and play them in a TikTok video, or Instagram post) or you decline to do so. Either way, you get paid $0.50 per premium submission you accept or deny.

That's it - it's really simple, and so long as you have some playlists or social media presence, you can make some decent beer money through SubmitHub. Every day or so, people will send you songs you can listen to &amp; you'll get paid whether or not you decide to accept it (e.g add it to a playlist) or deny it (e.g, decide you don't like it enough to add to a playlist).

##### **Info**

* **Minimum cashout**: $10 (I've made ~$250 total since October 2021, [some recent payments](https://i.imgur.com/L1onPei.png))
* **Payment options**: PayPal, Bank Transfer, or Submithub credits (used for promoting songs)
* **What Do You Do?**: curate playlists, or promote songs on your social medias, blogs, radio stations, etc. So long as you have at least 1 playlist that fits the minimum requirements, you can also benefit from smaller ones.

  * Spotify: must have at least 1,000 organic, engaged followers on at least one playlist. No payola or bought followers.

##### **How Do You Sign Up?**

Use my referral https://www.submithub.com/by/madbrad200 - I get $5 for every 10 premium submissions you accept (up to $50)  
Or use this **non-referral** link: https://www.submithub.com/apply

As far as I can tell, there is no referral bonus for people who use the referral link, so up to you which you wanna use.

Once Submithub accept you (if you meet their playlist/social media requirements), you'll start to have musicians send you their songs &amp; once that begins, you'll be able to start earning some $. The amount of $ you earn will depend on the size of your playlists or social media presence - the bigger, the more music you get sent, the more $ you make.

---

##### **How Do You Grow Your Playlists?**

If you're playlisting songs, you benefit the most from Submithub if you have active, followed playlists, so growing them is important. Once they hit a certain size, they tend to grow organically on their own but some ideas (obviously, never spam):

1. Post in relevant subreddits/threads. I've seen playlists go viral by doing this well.
2. Use [subreddits specifically dedicated](https://www.reddit.com/user/madbrad200/m/playlists/) to promoting playlists.
3. Plug your playlists in forums, discords, make social media posts about them, etc. 
4. Pay for google/facebook/Spotify/etc ads to promote your playlists. Big curators tend to do this.

I believe there are also techniques you can use to help boost your playlists in searches, e.g not playlisting too many songs from the same artist, regularly updating the playlist, etc. I honestly don't min-max this as much as I could and I do fine, so.

Most curators, including myself, *only accept a very small amount of submissions* ([see my stats](https://i.imgur.com/2OI0Pdo.png)). Of course, it's all up to you what you accept or deny, but my point is that there's no incentive to ONLY accept music to get $. You get paid regardless. It's down to what YOU enjoy.

---

##### **Who Should Consider Using Submithub?**

* People who enjoy music
* People who enjoy curating playlists OR have a social media presence &amp; like to use music in your posts
* People who build legitimate playlists with legitimate followings - you won't get paid by botting your playlists for followers and having 0 actual listeners. Seriously... it's obvious when people do this, and doesn't help anyone. You will get booted.
* Anyone from casual music curators (like me) to professional radio DJ's can do this. The barrier to entry is very small - but if you don't enjoy listening to new music, this won't be for you.
* People who already maintain playlists and/or have a social media following (that meet the minimum requirements listed at the top of this post)

wmrmi1,1660327028.0,beermoneyglobal,Madbrad200,Submithub - guide on making money with your Spotify playlists and/or social medias with music,"##### **What Is It?**

Submithub is a **website for playlist curators** or **folk with a social media presence** that enjoy music &amp; want to earn some $ by helping promote music that musicians send you.

**Playlists**

1. You have a playlist(s)
2. People send you songs on Submithub.
3. You listen to the songs people send you.
4. If the song is a free submission (artists get 1 a day to send to ppl), you don't get any $. These are still good to check out though, keeps your activity up and you may find some good music.
5. If the song is a 'premium submission' (i.e, the artist paid submithub to send it to you), you get paid if you accept (and add the songs to your playlist(s)) or decline the songs (and not add them to your playlist). You earn $0.50 per submission either way.

I typically get ~6-8 premium submissions every 2-3 days or so. It will vary depending on your social media size or playlist size. It's also up to you how long you wish to keep the song in the playlist; personally I'd say a month minimum.

**Socials**

Or you can get paid via social media:

1. You have an active Instagram or TikTok
2. People send you songs on Submithub
3. You listen to the songs.
4. Either you accept the songs (and play them in a TikTok video, or Instagram post) or you decline to do so. Either way, you get paid $0.50 per premium submission you accept or deny.

That's it - it's really simple, and so long as you have some playlists or social media presence, you can make some decent beer money through SubmitHub. Every day or so, people will send you songs you can listen to &amp; you'll get paid whether or not you decide to accept it (e.g add it to a playlist) or deny it (e.g, decide you don't like it enough to add to a playlist).

##### **Info**

* **Minimum cashout**: $10 (I've made ~$250 total since October 2021, [some recent payments](https://i.imgur.com/L1onPei.png))
* **Payment options**: PayPal, Bank Transfer, or Submithub credits (used for promoting songs)
* **What Do You Do?**: curate playlists, or promote songs on your social medias, blogs, radio stations, etc. So long as you have at least 1 playlist that fits the minimum requirements, you can also benefit from smaller ones.

* **Minimum requirements below (only need to fit one of these):**

  * Blogs: must have at least 1,000 fans and be more than six months old (unless listed on Hype Machine)
  * YouTube/SoundCloud: must have at least 10,000 followers

##### **How Do You Sign Up?**

Use my referral https://www.submithub.com/by/madbrad200 - I get $5 for every 10 premium submissions you accept (up to $50)  
Or use this **non-referral** link: https://www.submithub.com/apply

As far as I can tell, there is no referral bonus for people who use the referral link, so up to you which you wanna use.

Once Submithub accept you (if you meet their playlist/social media requirements), you'll start to have musicians send you their songs &amp; once that begins, you'll be able to start earning some $. The amount of $ you earn will depend on the size of your playlists or social media presence - the bigger, the more music you get sent, the more $ you make.

---

##### **How Do You Grow Your Playlists?**

If you're playlisting songs, you benefit the most from Submithub if you have active, followed playlists, so growing them is important. Once they hit a certain size, they tend to grow organically on their own but some ideas (obviously, never spam):

1. Post in relevant subreddits/threads. I've seen playlists go viral by doing this well.
2. Use [subreddits specifically dedicated](https://www.reddit.com/user/madbrad200/m/playlists/) to promoting playlists.
3. Plug your playlists in forums, discords, make social media posts about them, etc. 
4. Pay for google/facebook/Spotify/etc ads to promote your playlists. Big curators tend to do this.

I believe there are also techniques you can use to help boost your playlists in searches, e.g not playlisting too many songs from the same artist, regularly updating the playlist, etc. I honestly don't min-max this as much as I could and I do fine, so.

Most curators, including myself, *only accept a very small amount of submissions* ([see my stats](https://i.imgur.com/2OI0Pdo.png)). Of course, it's all up to you what you accept or deny, but my point is that there's no incentive to ONLY accept music to get $. You get paid regardless. It's down to what YOU enjoy.

---

##### **Who Should Consider Using Submithub?**

* People who enjoy music
* People who enjoy curating playlists OR have a social media presence &amp; like to use music in your posts
* People who build legitimate playlists with legitimate followings - you won't get paid by botting your playlists for followers and having 0 actual listeners. Seriously... it's obvious when people do this, and doesn't help anyone. You will get booted.
* Anyone from casual music curators (like me) to professional radio DJ's can do this. The barrier to entry is very small - but if you don't enjoy listening to new music, this won't be for you.
* People who already maintain playlists and/or have a social media following (that meet the minimum requirements listed at the top of this post)

5. If the song is a 'premium submission' (i.e, the artist paid submithub to send it to you), you get paid if you accept (and add the songs to your playlist(s)) or decline the songs (and not add them to your playlist). You earn $0.50 per submission either way.

I typically get ~6-8 premium submissions every 2-3 days or so. It will vary depending on your social media size or playlist size. It's also up to you how long you wish to keep the song in the playlist; personally I'd say a month minimum.

**Socials**

Or you can get paid via social media:

1. You have an active Instagram or TikTok
2. People send you songs on Submithub
3. You listen to the songs.
4. Either you accept the songs (and play them in a TikTok video, or Instagram post) or you decline to do so. Either way, you get paid $0.50 per premium submission you accept or deny.

That's it - it's really simple, and so long as you have some playlists or social media presence, you can make some decent beer money through SubmitHub. Every day or so, people will send you songs you can listen to &amp; you'll get paid whether or not you decide to accept it (e.g add it to a playlist) or deny it (e.g, decide you don't like it enough to add to a playlist).

* **Minimum cashout**: $10 (I've made ~$250 total since October 2021, [some recent payments](https://i.imgur.com/L1onPei.png))
* **Payment options**: PayPal, Bank Transfer, or Submithub credits (used for promoting songs)
* **What Do You Do?**: curate playlists, or promote songs on your social medias, blogs, radio stations, etc. So long as you have at least 1 playlist that fits the minimum requirements, you can also benefit from smaller ones.

* **Minimum requirements below (only need to fit one of these):**
  * [Influencer](https://img.submithub.com/images/original/pYFaz8SjvGedWzv3m/1-3thkawupegwo0f2zs3fhlw-1613372487790.png): At least 5,000 followers with frequent sharing and good engagement (typically Instagram)

##### **How Do You Sign Up?**

Use my referral https://www.submithub.com/by/madbrad200 - I get $5 for every 10 premium submissions you accept (up to $50)  
Or use this **non-referral** link: https://www.submithub.com/apply

As far as I can tell, there is no referral bonus for people who use the referral link, so up to you which you wanna use.

Once Submithub accept you (if you meet their playlist/social media requirements), you'll start to have musicians send you their songs &amp; once that begins, you'll be able to start earning some $. The amount of $ you earn will depend on the size of your playlists or social media presence - the bigger, the more music you get sent, the more $ you make.

---

##### **How Do You Grow Your Playlists?**

If you're playlisting songs, you benefit the most from Submithub if you have active, followed playlists, so growing them is important. Once they hit a certain size, they tend to grow organically on their own but some ideas (obviously, never spam):

1. Post in relevant subreddits/threads. I've seen playlists go viral by doing this well.
2. Use [subreddits specifically dedicated](https://www.reddit.com/user/madbrad200/m/playlists/) to promoting playlists.
3. Plug your playlists in forums, discords, make social media posts about them, etc. 
4. Pay for google/facebook/Spotify/etc ads to promote your playlists. Big curators tend to do this.

I believe there are also techniques you can use to help boost your playlists in searches, e.g not playlisting too many songs from the same artist, regularly updating the playlist, etc. I honestly don't min-max this as much as I could and I do fine, so.

Most curators, including myself, *only accept a very small amount of submissions* ([see my stats](https://i.imgur.com/2OI0Pdo.png)). Of course, it's all up to you what you accept or deny, but my point is that there's no incentive to ONLY accept music to get $. You get paid regardless. It's down to what YOU enjoy.

---

##### **Who Should Consider Using Submithub?**

* People who enjoy music
* People who enjoy curating playlists OR have a social media presence &amp; like to use music in your posts
* People who build legitimate playlists with legitimate followings - you won't get paid by botting your playlists for followers and having 0 actual listeners. Seriously... it's obvious when people do this, and doesn't help anyone. You will get booted.
* Anyone from casual music curators (like me) to professional radio DJ's can do this. The barrier to entry is very small - but if you don't enjoy listening to new music, this won't be for you.
* People who already maintain playlists and/or have a social media following (that meet the minimum requirements listed at the top of this post)

---

##### What else can you do?

If you're a radio DJ, blogger, or have some other internet presence - you can also profit through Submithub. Again, not something I've done so can't speak on it much.

##### Isn't this payola...?

No. Payola is illegal because it's paying money for *guaranteed* playlist/radio plays. On Submithub, you're being paid to *consider* music for playlisting/radio/promotion/etc and as pointed out above, most submissions do end up getting rejected (and not playlisted/radioed/etc) - hence, not payola.

Having recently gotten into beermoney websites myself I quickly ran into a problem - being located in Eastern Europe it is difficult to find something that actually works. So, I've spent some time and gathered around a fair amount of websites that I personally tested to see if they worked for real or not. These were tried out in Estonia but should work worldwide. It is highly recommended to combine various websites in order to maximize earnings.

Please don't hesitate to share any beermoney websites that you know as well. Be aware that most of these websites require verified **PayPal** in order to process withdrawals, so make sure you have that sorted out.

**Get-Paid-To (GPT)** 

As the title suggests, ""Get-Paid-To"" websites pay you to do certain tasks. Now there might not be too many surveys available that work, but offers can be well worth doing in my opinion. Take some time to browse around to see what is available (for example, mobile game offers). Once you have found something I recommend to start comparing rates that different GPT websites are offering (for example, game X with offerwall Y is available both on Freecash and Swagbucks, but Freecash has a higher payout for completing the same task). 

Generally the games offered are very grindy but not impossible to complete. Patience is key, make sure to do your research about offered games to see which ones are the easiest.

w7siu7,1658764588.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,swimNotsink,Subjectiveness of Track Mixing vs Artist Vision,"Hey guys,

   
So recently I've just released a track I wrote together with a producer and I'm sending out pitches to submithub to promote it.   
The responses are extremely polarising. Some say the mix was done well, while others say the mix has serious issues (like too much reverb/ too central vocals).   


A little background, during the mixing sessions, the producer showed me a mix version that sounded very different from the rough mix. Which I rejected because the version presented was 'too commercial'. Basically clean sounding (but 'tin-ny' tone), minimal reverb pop template. My vision was more of a 'empty room visual' hence, heavier reverbs but only at the end of phrases as a compromise. I'm more influenced by London Grammar type of sound.   


I guess I'm just trying to process some of the feedback I'm getting from my song pitches. While I understand song preference is subjective, I try my best to learn from 'objective' critiques. Hence, I always filter out the technical comments to try and improve. Now, I'm not a very experienced artist with tons of releases so there are plenty of things I have yet to learn but getting 'mix is bad' comments is stressing me out.  
   
Its like 'what if I had seriously considered the original mix draft proposed by my producer ? Would it have been better? ' but then again what about the people who thought the mix was decent?    
Am I personally satisfied with how the track conveys my vision? Yes.   
But should I compromise my vision just to satiate 'mix issues' with the bigger population? I have no idea...   
Also, I wrote the song (base chords etc.), lyrics, melody and produced the song. While my producer mainly helped in arrangement composition. Has anyone else felt this way before? Or perhaps faced something similar?   


Tldr; Directed track mix per my specifications and released a song. Polarising comments with people loving the mix and others saying mix has serious issues.

w7qcfu,1658759208.0,MusicPromotionTricks,jagtrordumenar,Have you ever paid for a playlist placement?,"Hey!

Tons of curators on Spotify charge money to place your track on their playlist(s). Have you ever paid for a playlist placement? If so, how did it pan out?

And I’m not talking about a submission fee (like on SubmitHub), I’m talking straight up “pay me $50 and I’ll place your song on my playlist for 3 weeks”.

Spotify is strictly against charging for playlist placements but still most big user-created playlists do. I’ve heard of repercussions such as getting your track or playlist removed if there’s suspicious streaming activity. But has anyone ever had it happen to them?

Just curious.

vu754h,1657274371.0,edmproduction,alfiealfiealfie,My take on writers block / writing songs /getting stuck - just my experience.,"I'm seeing a lot of folks today stuck with starting or finishing or just stuck with writing stuff. Here's what works for me. It's not right or wrong, it's just what works for me.

**Finding number one**
It's not what you start with but how you harmonise what you start with. The most basic chord progression you can totally flip around with a bassline + melody + other chord voicings on top. You can stretch a basic chord progression with so many harmonisations around it. So don't stress too much if your initial chord progression is uninspiring  - it's how you work with it that matters much more.
edit: helpful link about harmonisation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVHyuhsAles

**Finding number two**
Can't finish a track? Make it shorter. Don't feel bad about making a 2 minute track. Finishing it in any form is psychologically important.

**Finding number three**
Really really hate your track? Permanently delete it. The fact it exists is negative karma and distracting. It's like having a vase of mouldy flowers in your kitchen. No one wants to see that. Yes, this is really contenscious but its for the few very rare tracks that end up as total dumpster fires. This happens very rarely. Like once a year. 

**Finding number four**
Use Twitch. You can also see what other folks are producing and how they work with their DAW. This is a huge learning opportunity for you. Use it. I've learned so much. 

**Finding number five**
Use feedback channels. This sub has one, there's loads on the aforementioned Twitch and Submithub has an anonymous feature called Hot or Not where you can see how your music fares and often times gain useful insight into your work. Feedback channels have improved the way I write. 

**Finding number six**
Take a break from time to time. You can't always be writing. I find it stressful, depressing sometimes. Time away is good because in that time off your little brain is subconciously composing stuff.

I got videos i will edit to make a clip and upload the songs on youtube(shamefully the videos are stuck in a phone with a broken screen i need to fix first so this has to be delayed).

I read about submithub.

Then theres all those youtube channels but i'd like to wait on the footage i have to send those.

Is distrokid worth it for the first release? if so, wich plan? since its gonna be various artist almost everytime.

Im very anxious to just publish it and start sending promos to friends since im WAY over my self made deadline, like 2 months late for myself.

So i made the release private in the meantime and will publish it once promo has finished.","im planning on releasing my first song with a few friends(some known names) in a label i created.i already have the songs, the artwork, the bandcamp page, the domain but i want help promoting it. i got videos i will edit to make a clip and upload the songs on youtube(shamefully the videos are stuck in a phone with a broken screen i need to fix first so this has to be delayed). i read about submithub. then theres all those youtube channels but i'd like to wait on the footage i have to send those. is distrokid worth it for the first release? if so, wich plan? since its gonna be various artist almost everytime. im very anxious to just publish it and start sending promos to friends since im way over my self made deadline, like 2 months late for myself. you think is ok to start slowly with the promotion and the start amping it up if works in a small scale? is that smart? or should i start the best way possible from the release day?.  i plan to have 1 release every 2 months to start. thanks. edia through my inner circle i found people that offer promo services so they take care of delivering music to the right djs. so i made the release private in the meantime and will publish it once promo has finished.",14,232

* Artists can’t screen/select influencers like playlists or blogs. 
* SubmitHub sent to influencers outside our requested geographical area, which is kind of a bummer.
* We received nine acceptances. One uploaded content based on our requests and two others uploaded their own thing without hash tagging or tagging the band.
* One influencer tried to sell us her club remix service for €375, which we politely declined. I think she knew there is specific feedback for people that try to sell something, so she let the offer expire to avoid that part of the system.
* The other five expired.

veeuse,1655477246.0,Songwriting,Big-Association-239,Plalylist Push is a Scam,"So, I play 2-4 gigs a month and get paid a few hundred bucks apiece for them, nothing near enough to become a professional, but I thought I'd take some of that money and reinvest it in my music and delve into the wide world of music marketing services. I'm posting my results here for others who are thinking of paying to promote their music. I also would love any advice from those who have done this sort of thing 

To begin, as noted in my title, Playlist Push is a complete scam. I repeat, DO NOY WASTE YOUR MONEY ON PLAYLIST PUSH. I paid them $300 to send a song to their list of ""curated playlists"" the song got put on zero playlists. That's right, 300 dollars for literally nothing. Worse, I got many responses from playlist owners that the song was really good but didn't fit the style of their playlist. So why did Playlist Push send to them? What a joke, so much for ""curated."" Even worse, I sent the exact same song to 15 playlist curators via Submithub and got 2 accepted. So I got about a 10% acceptance rate -- versus 0% -- doing it myself, and more importantly only cost about $20 worth of credits to do so on Submit Hub. If you take one thing away from this post PLEASE DON'T USE PLAYLIST PUSH!

Some other services I used to varying degrees of success:

OmariMC, which claims to get you guaranteed listens. I used their ""bronze""  tier which for $77 says they will get your song 500-5000 plays on spotify. Mine got 1200 as of now, so that's nice. I'm under no illusion that 1200 people actually listened to my song, I'm sure they use bots, but at least I got something to show for my money, unlike Playlist Push.

I decide to use twitter ads, boosting a tweet I sent that had a link to the song. I spent 100 bucks to boost for 5 days. While the tweet got over 100 likes it only got 1 rewteet, resulted in only 1 new follower and had only  13 clickthroughs on the link to the song. So, not great.

I also paid 25 bucks through Reverbnation to have a ""digital ad"" show up on Facebook and other social media platforms. Unfortunately these ads lead those who click on it to your reverbnation page and not spotify/youtube etc and i have no idea how to monetize reverbnation. I also don't trust their statistics; they claim I am the 33rd most popular artist in my region; Well I am in the NYC region and I seriously doubt with all the signed/professional musicians in the NYC area plus the thousands of unsigned acts that I am number 33. But the ad did get 40-50 people to listen to songs on my reverb nation page. For 25 bucks, probably the best value of all the things I did.

I wanted to post this to give real life examples to those who are considering paying for a music promotion service. I was able to reinvest my extra money from gigs into this, but I know many musicians do not have the extra 5-600 bucks to throw at promotion so wanted to help anyone thinking about it. Definitely avoid Playlist Push at all costs. I guess for value the reverbnation ad and submit hub got the best bang for my buck. Omari delivered on what they promised, but I suspect they use bots.

v5lwzv,1654461101.0,metalmusicians,Whyunopraisethesun,"My debut album got 4,400 streams on Spotify in one week and here's how I did it"," I consider the release of my debut album ""Vampiric"" a success. I am a bedroom musician working alone, as many of us are, writing, recording, producing, releasing and promoting music all by ourselves. The tips I've read about promotion are rarely that good or simply outdated. That's why I want to share some concrete advice everyone could have some use for.

**The stats**

During the first week my album got [4,400 streams on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1jESTrMysbrWrEWc0fC4Ts?si=ba7d9076399e4e13) and [2000 streams on Bandcamp in the app](https://clayshaper.bandcamp.com/album/vampiric-2). 61 fans decided to purchase the album for a price they found fair and 171 downloaded it for free. I earned around $200 just from sales.

**The hard truth** 

Nobody gives a shit about you or your 'new' music. Making good music is just the bare minimum of getting any attention at all. 2022 people are very, very, focused on the visual aspect of whatever you're trying to promote. Pure music is neither visual nor easy to access as most people on their phones won't put in headphones or start the sound just for some random guy. Good music can spread by itself, but it's so rare it's almost a myth at this point. But there are ways getting around this.

**Social Media presence**

[My main channel of communication is Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/clayshaper/). I've found that by using hashtags, following and talking to interesting people and releasing simple videos of me performing my music is the best way to reach out. Battling the algorithm is much harder on Twitter and Facebook, even though sharing links is easier on those platforms. I focus all my energy on Instagram, cross post everything on Facebook, copy paste and shorten for twitter and release longer, high quality content for Youtube to promote my music. If I have vertical video of a performance I will post it on IG Stories, TV, Reels, Youtube Shorts and TikTok. 

**Getting around it**

If people want visual, I give them visual. I started sharing my own photographs and curated contemporary/old art I like (always got permission if it wasn't in the public domain) and transitioned into posting my own art alongside videos of me performing my music. Now people stay for the art and may give my music a chance. I've been doing this for four years and are near [22,000 followers on Instagram.](https://www.instagram.com/clayshaper/?hl=en) Cross platform I have around 29,000 followers (Bandcamp, Spotify, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok). I put no effort into the other ones, but they keep growing there too because of the cross posting.

**Growing a fanbase**

\* Every platform wants to keep it's users on that platform, so I rarely use links just to see my YouTube views get inflated by a couple of clicks, for example. Build a fanbase by grinding on that platform, and call to action down the line when it matters. Don't expect to grow by spamming links.

\* Content that's purely music is hard to pierce the buzz, especially extreme music. Are you a streamer? Artist? Videographer? Photographer? Do you like to cook? Lifestyle enthusiast? Dancer? Working with clay? Literally anything else that's visual can be used to boost your music. But this is just how I like do it.

\* Releasing singles keeps the attention of your fans. Releasing an album creates a bigger buzz. Don't bother sending singles to journalists and reviewers, but absolutely make an effort to promote an album.

**Chronological: The release**

\* Completed the album and put it up on a music distribution service. [Distrokid is popular](https://distrokid.com/vip/seven/1416772?gclid=Cj0KCQjwqPGUBhDwARIsANNwjV7ufQT9m2FUheHzP027Tw0EDIghNMPYra6XawyJzzeWmC84ljnucbcaAnAoEALw_wcB) and has a monthly cost but unlimited uploads. I use [Emubands](https://www.emubands.com/simple-pricing/) to keep all royalties and do album uploads with one time lifetime costs.

\* Claim my Spotify artist page and pitch a song on the album to their editorial theme. My song didn't make the cut, but if accepted it's huge. Do this at least a month prior to release.

\* Began posting short snippets of me playing the new songs to create a hype.

\* Filmed and released a [music video all by myself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnDVvCeRMMU). Posted this on Reddit and submitted the video to YouTube channels like BlankTV and Black Metal Promotion.

\* Ran a small giveaway (band patches) for people who pre-saved the album on Spotify via [smart.url.](https://manage.smarturl.it/)

\* Looked up reviews of bands that sounds like me, gathered the email addresses of those blogs and news outlets. I gathered around 150 of them and blasted out a press release consisting of album art, pictures of me, the songs, a private album stream, some information about the album and my band and quotes by me about the album. This got me featured on [MetalSucks and a couple of other sites](https://www.metalsucks.net/2022/05/26/exclusive-album-stream-clayshaper-spread-their-black-and-poisonous-wings-on-vampiric/).

\* On release I put out [one more music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lwxHgefgm0) video done with a single camera and me in the woods.

\* Submitted my music to 17 metal playlisters on [submithub](https://www.submithub.com/). Was accepted by half of them.

\* Ran Spotify ads on Facebook for $50 for great results. [I followed this tutorial to set them up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klB5Iq8e7sU)

**Ending**

I have made over 30 demos on compilations and EP:s since I started CLAYSHAPER back in 2018. I know 4,400 doesn't sound like much, but seeing actual people listening to your music in real time on Spotify's dashboard is a cool feeling. Receiving comments about AOTY is also humbling. I hope you as a reader got something out of my little write up.

I am a bedroom musician working alone, as many of us are, writing, recording, producing, releasing and promoting music all by ourselves. The tips I've read about promotion are rarely that good or simply outdated. That's why I want to share some concrete advice everyone could have some use for. **The stats** During the first week my album got 4,400 streams on Spotify and transitioned into posting my own art alongside videos of me performing my music. Now people stay for the art and may give my music a chance. I've been doing this for four years and are near 22,000 followers on Instagram.. I put no effort into the other ones, but they keep growing there too because of the cross posting. **Growing a fanbase** \* Every platform wants to keep it's users on that platform, so I rarely use links just to see my YouTube views get inflated by a couple of clicks, for example. Build a fanbase by grinding on that platform, and call to action down the line when it matters. Don't expect to grow by spamming links. \* Content that's purely music is hard to pierce the buzz, especially extreme music. Are you a streamer? Artist? Videographer? Photographer? Do you like to cook? Lifestyle enthusiast? Dancer? Working with clay? Literally anything else that's visual can be used to boost your music. But this is just how I like do it. \* Releasing singles keeps the attention of your fans. Releasing an album creates a bigger buzz. Don't bother sending singles to journalists and reviewers, but absolutely make an effort to promote an album. **Chronological The release** \* Completed the album and put it up on a music distribution service. Distrokid is popular for people who pre-saved the album on Spotify via smart.url.( \* Looked up reviews of bands that sounds like me, gathered the email addresses of those blogs and news outlets. I gathered around 150 of them and blasted out a press release consisting of album art, pictures of me, the songs, a private album stream, some information about the album and my band and quotes by me about the album.

v36ivm,1654168650.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,SeaAd735,I spent 500 dollars on playlist promotion. Here is my experience:,"I made a summer song that I thought was extremely playlistable, so I thought it was time to really try out playlist promotion. Here are some stats:


Playlistpush: 

Money spent: 302 dollars 

Responses: 15

Groover:

Cost per response: 2 dollars

Omari:

Money spent: 100 dollars 

Responses, playlist adds, anything else: ???

I started with putting just a few dollars in Submithub, and got my first (and biggest) playlist add, gaining over 8000 streams in total from that playlist. It was removed from the playlist after one week. So I invested some more in Submithub and got a few placements. The placements were quite unimpressive for the most part. 

I heard from Groover trough reddit, and decided to try it out. I got a lot of placements, but they weren’t that high quality. 

Since I started getting a lot of streams from this one big playlist, I got excited and decided to splurge in a Playlist Push campaign, spending over 300 dollars. This campaign was by far the most dissapointing. I had very little control over the playlists it was getting pitched to, and most of the responses said: ”I love this track!! It sounds amazing!!! Unfortunately I don’t have a playlist this would fit in”. I thought I would get high quality feedback, since I spent so much money, but the feedback was as good as anywhere else. 

The Omari campaign was weird. It says you get a certain amount of streams and you do get it trough some odd playlist adds. But the streams seem to be quite low quality. 

Will I keep using it:
Submithub : yes

Groover : probably not

Omari : no 

Playlist Push: no

I am pursuing a career in music and have already had some big performances over the last couple of years.  My shows have gone very well and I get a lot of good feedback on my original songs.

I posted one of my songs on submithub’s “hot or not” section and I feel really confused.  Everyone wrote a nice comment but a lot of people give nice comments than leave a rating below their average rating.  It feels like they are just clicking the ranking scale fast because they want their own music rated.  I’m not saying my music is incredible but I am fairly confident it is better than the average songs there in my genre.
But I also have a small sample size (only 10 ratings).

I also posted an amazing song from a different artist just to see if it would get the ratings it deserved.  The artist is pretty successful but not incredibly famous cuz I didn’t want people to recognise him.However it  also got random ratings and has a slightly below average rating.

I have just released an album produced by Boyfifty (~49K IG followers) and even managed to secure a feature with a notability bigger artist LIL DUSTY G (~28K IG followers, ~500,000 monthly listeners on Spotify). Needless to say I put a lot of time, effort and money into my music.. which is where the help I need comes in. two services I use to promote my music are Playlist Push and SubmitHub. They are both non-guaranteed placement services, meaning you could spend money with 0 results but I love it because it’s reaching real people, and I’d much rather have a small amount of organic reach and not an insane amount of bots streaming my music. However, no matter how I label my music as a genre, it seems the curators/influencers tend to say the tracks are good, but not the genre they are looking for. I’d consider my music alternative hip hop. Although I’ve seen people call this music Alternative rock, emo rap, indie rap and Lofi rap which to me are all fairly different genres. I just need to know the most overlapped genre for my album so I can better target curators. I’ll leave the SoundCloud link but will leave any other platform link upon request. Thank you to anyone who can help in advance, it’s really appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

I think i speak for all of us, when it comes to recieving some attention and recognition on our music. We can use a lot of different platform/websites to try and publish our songs to a wider audience via playlist curators, which then add your song to their playlist for a bigger audience to listen to it. (F.e. submithub is one of the more better known websites regarding this process). So far so good.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently submitted one of my songs to some playlist curators on submithub. But the song was either not interesting enough for the curators, so they either didn't reply, or most of them just straight up rejected the song. No problem here, no one cared. Music is always very subjective and these days there's a lot of really astonishing music producers and therefore music out there. The important thing here is to not give up and try to get better and better !

&amp;#x200B;

But when I checked my spotify account a few days later I was surprised to see that nevertheless I went from absolutely 0 listeners to 78 within less than a day. 99% of these listeners originate from one country and were from ""Other listener's playlist"" - 1 playlist. So you may ask where's the scam now ?

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where things get interesting. When I checked which playlist these plays were coming from (spotify shows in the section ""found in"" playlists which contain the music profile, and there was only one playlist for my account). The playlist name and curator both were advertising a website. The website lets you buy streams for real money... The playlist itself has hundreds of thousands of plays, but the spotify curator account barely has 25 followers. So all the plays that were coming from that playlist onto my track are fake. I won't go into any names here but I suspect that one of the submithub curators or someone close to them must run this website hoping they can make money of ""desperate"" music creators which actually seems clever and extremely disgusting at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

The important lesson here is to not fall for this and keep focusing on your own music skills getting better and better. Hopefully this finds it's way to the person who needs it the most, because this might seem quiet tempting starting off making music and not having any listeners yet.",3,1.0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/ujt77j/beware_of_this_when_submitting_your_music/,Beware of this when submitting your music,beware of this when submitting your music,"I'm writing this post, so others don't fall for this scheme/scam, because it's actually quiet interesting. &x200B; I think i speak for all of us, when it comes to recieving some attention and recognition on our music.

But this is slightly more specific. I understand playlist submissions, but the jury still seems to be out as to how helpful those submithub/playlistsupply sites are, plus I have been tasked with identifying labels and contacts for those labels that review demos. But from what I have seen in my research, not many labels accept unsolicited submissions.   


I am quasi-managing an artist, whose music I really believe in. He really puts in the work and its apparent in the quality of his recordings and mixing. I say 'quasi' managing because we basically just meet weekly and discuss strategies for how he can make social media content and I can work on getting his music heard by more people.   


He asked me to try to find labels to submit his music to, but I have been struggling. I keep finding submithub style websites that take your money and promise to send it to A&amp;Rs at labels, or claim to have their own team of 'A&amp;Rs' that send it along to their 'contacts.'

u1klvu,1649719156.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,jorund_brightbrewer,My Band Received a Record Deal through Submithub: A Cautionary Tale,"My band recently received a record label offer through a label on Submithub. Initially, we were excited yet cautiously optimistic at the prospect of signing with a label that has access to more marketing and networking resources than we have on our own. Once we got deeper into the signing process, though, we quickly abandoned the deal due to some bizarre occurrences with the label that I will outline here. I've chosen to keep this story anonymous because I don't want any recognition for my band's music coming from this post. Rather, I want to provide a cautionary tale to other bands who might find themselves in our position.

For the purposes of anonymity, I will call the label representative who reached out to us ""Mark."" Mark connected with my band via social media after we submitted to his label on Submithub, which means that none of our conversations occurred on Submithub itself.  I submitted our music this label because we are a coed band and many of the other bands on this label were coed, too, and their collective sounds mixed well with our genre.

Initially, I thought it was odd that a label president would DM us on our social media to start a conversation about a record deal, particularly since our e-mail and phone number are visible on our website and social media. However, I decided to be cautiously openminded about his approach. Mark said that he was visiting our city soon and that we could sign the deal when he was in town. I started asking Mark business and legal questions about the deal. Mark dodged most of my questions at first and emphasized that he likes to be ""personal"" so that he can get to know the bands on his label. I got the sense that Mark was trying hard to put out the vibe that he wasn't some ""corporate"" label suit.

When I asked Mark for a copy of the record contract, he didn't respond to my question at first. Instead, he sent us a link to a video of The Rock and talked about how The Rock is a huge inspiration to him. Mark also revealed that he once tried to take his own life. He said that music ""saved"" him from taking his own life and that he started a label to help advocate for mental health. I'm a mental health therapist in my day job, so, of course, I was empathetic to his struggles and to his label's mission. However, I couldn't help but feel like Mark was somehow being disingenuous. Again, I tried to be openminded, and I figured Mark was maybe just trying to keep things personal before talking about business.

For the next several hours, though, Mark would DM us with more personal questions about ourselves. He said that he ""hates drama"" and then immediately started speaking poorly about bands he rejected from his label. Because all of us in the band were busy that day, we couldn't keep an ongoing dialogue via the DMs. When we went a few minutes without responding, Mark would say, ""Hello?"" and presented as agitated when we couldn't respond immediately.

I finally asked Mark, ""Hey, it's been nice connecting with you on here. Can we schedule a meeting sometime this week to talk about the deal?"" Mark responded, ""No, it's too hard to accommodate everyone's schedules. We'll just chat here."" I said, ""Actually, we are all available in the late afternoon and evening every day for the next several weeks. What day would work for you?""

At this point, Mark became frustrated with us and lamented, ""No one cares about making personal connections anymore. I'll email the contract to you right now, though."" I then replied to Mark, ""Great! I'll have our legal team look over the contract. Can you give us a few days to read over it?""

Now, a typical business person in this position would say, ""Yes, please look over the contract and let me know what questions you have!"" Not Mark, though. Mark became defensive and replied: ""Well, the record contract was good enough for (the band he most recently signed) and their team of lawyers, so I'm sure it's good enough for yours, too."" At this point, all of us in the band were ready to back out right at that moment, but we figured that regardless of the outcome this could be a good learning experience for us, so we decided to keep entertaining the offer.

I sent the contract to two lawyers who work with my band. Both lawyers had serious concerns about the record contract. The writing had poor grammar and diction. According to one of our lawyers, the contract ""looked like a law student taking Contract Law for the first time wrote it as a class assignment."" The legally binding terms of the contract were problematic, too. There's too many problematic sentences to quote here, but here's just one example. Regarding royalties, the contract states, ""The Artist in connection with those Entertainment Services and the parties agree to share the income and royalties generated by the rendering of these certain Entertainment Services by (record company name)."" The contract, however, did not state what percentage of royalties we would split with Mark and his label.

While we were in the process of reviewing the contract with our lawyers, Mark started DMing our singer on her personal DMs. While Mark did not state anything explicitly sexual to our singer, Mark made several inappropriate comments to her that creeped her out. For example, Mark complained about being harassed by salesman at the mall. He bragged about his body size and said he ""dared"" someone to ""mess"" with him again at the mall. Our singer was polite and gave him brief responses because she was afraid of making him upset; however, she was extremely uncomfortable with these DMs and wondered why he wasn't messaging anyone else in the band. This next idea is purely speculative: as I mentioned earlier, all of the bands on Mark's label were mixed gender. We wondered if Mark used his authority as a ""label president"" to put women into uncomfortable conversations and situations. Again, I'm not sure if this was Mark's true intention, but that's how he came across to us.

Given everything I have described so far, we decided that there were waaay too many red flags, so I wrote politely to Mark via email and told him that we were backing out of the deal. We also blocked Mark on all of our social media so that he couldn't contact us there. Mark wrote back to us and said verbatim, ""My opinion of you was clearly wrong. I hope you act more appropriately in the future.""

Submithub isn't perfect, but I do think it's a great way to get immediate feedback on your music. Yes, like many posters here, we have received some baffling and inconsistent feedback on our music. However, I'd say that 75% of our rejection feedback has been constructive and helpful. I think it's so easy to become lost in rejection, though, that you can lose sight of yourself and your art. I wanted to share this story to show you that receiving an acceptance from Submithub may not come with the glory and recognition you seek. We have friends who have been accepted to ""popular"" curators' playlists on Submithub whose acceptances yielded little to no increase in their Spotify audience.

While I'm sure there are many honest and reputable labels on Submithub, this experience showed us that we might be better off networking with labels the old fashioned way. My band has no delusions of grandeur about becoming wealthy and famous from our art, though. We treat our music like a small business. We view money, recognition, and networking connections as resources that will help us to continue making better art. We recognize there's many viable paths to success in music, and we're also fortunate enough to have day jobs we all love that help us support our professional hobby. While the events of this story were frustrating to experience, they reminded us that we aren't desperate to receive a label offer and that we are probably better off just being DIY unless a truly great offer comes around.

tzdbs6,1649451881.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,cw9241,"[Official update; 1 week post-release and 468 streams later] ""Just got approved to my first semi-major Spotify playlist"" + tips!","The other week I made a post that my single got approved on a relatively larger playlist via Submithub after the first attempt. I promised an update once the single had been released, so here it is! 

My song did not actually make it onto this playlist until yesterday evening (6 days post-release), so the data I'm about to share with you is independent of this curator's playlist. The curator did also let me know yesterday that it is scheduled to be on there for 21 days, which was nice of him to let me know. I want to share how my single is doing as well as what I've been doing to obtain the numbers I've been able to obtain. 

Some quick background on me: I have 2 previously released singles from 2019 that did not do well (only people that listened to them were my mom and me lol). They were self-produced, self-mixed/mastered, and just were overall not of industry standard quality. I do not have a large following or fanbase for my music by any means. Before last week, I had 0 listeners on Apple Music and 1 monthly listener on Spotify. With this single, I hired some of the best musicians/producers in the industry to produce the music and mix for me after sending in my demo. I did my own vocals and had some friends help with BGVs.  

1. **Radio:**

12 radio station adds (1 national, 2 local, 8 internet) and 44 radio spins (only includes what I was able to personally track).

**How I was able to achieve this:**

I registered/encoded my song through BDSRadio and Mediabase in order for it to be eligible for airplay for most stations and so that it could be tracked on the Billboards. BDSRadio has a list of radio stations they service on their website, so I pulled that list, filtered the list to my song's genre, and created a master spreadsheet of radio stations and their contact information. I made sure to check the station's website first to see if they had a submission system already set up. If they did, I submitted the song through that system. If they did not, I created a standard email script, then modified it slightly to personalize it by including the recipient's name, station's name, and show's name if there was a specific show I was targeting. In the email, I attached a 256 kbps, meta-tagged mp3 radio-edited version of the song (less than 4:30), a biography, the single's cover art inline at the bottom of the email, and my EPK inline at the bottom. Once my song was released, I modified it to include a few streaming links for convenience. 

I found that most stations did not consider my song until it was already released. I re-submitted my song to stations I had emailed prior to release and received airplay almost immediately. I also found that I was more successful when I emailed during business hours on weekdays as opposed to in the evening or on the weekends. This is probably because the recipients are sitting at their desk with their emails open when my submission pops up. Most radio stations actually notified me that they were adding my song. Only one station, the national one, aired my song without notice.

I sent my submission emails to the station's main contact email. If I did not get a response, I then submitted it Programming Directors. If I still didn't get a response, I submitted them to radio hosts directly and asked if the song can be aired on their specific show. 

2. **Apple Music Stats:**

122 plays, 6 Average Daily Listeners, 19 Shazams, 122 Radio Spins, 2 Song Purchases.

**How I was able to achieve this:**

I created promo graphics and uploaded them to all of my social media accounts. I used the ""boost post"" options on Facebook and Instagram to promote my songs starting 3 weeks before release, and everyday the week after the release. I believe those 19 Shazams came from airing on the national radio station. 

3. **Spotify Stats:**

210 streams, 139 Monthly Listeners, 1.304 Streams/Listener, 8 saves, 8 playlist adds.

**How I was able to achieve this:**

I researched Spotify playlists and identified ones that looked like my song would be a good fit for. A lot of the playlisters I found did not have contact information in their bios. But the ones that did, I found them on Instagram and sent a sweet, personalized message raving about how awesome their playlist was and how I would love for my single to be considered for it. 87% of my Spotify streams came from the user-created playlists I was added to.

4. **YouTube Stats:**

136 views, 5.2 watch hours, 85 unique viewers, 10 likes, 0 dislikes.

**How I was able to achieve this:**

My dad played a heavy role in this and sent my song to a lot of my family and friends lol. Also, most of these views came from Facebook after I had created a boosted post containing the song's YouTube link. 

I really hope this helps someone!

Some quick background on me I have 2 previously released singles from 2019 that did not do well (only people that listened to them were my mom and me lol). They were self-produced, self-mixed/mastered, and just were overall not of industry standard quality. I do not have a large following or fanbase for my music by any means. Before last week, I had 0 listeners on Apple Music and 1 monthly listener on Spotify. With this single, I hired some of the best musicians/producers in the industry to produce the music and mix for me after sending in my demo. I did my own vocals and had some friends help with BGVs.   1. **Radio** 12 radio station adds (1 national, 2 local, 8 internet) and 44 radio spins (only includes what I was able to personally track). **How I was able to achieve this** I registered/encoded my song through BDSRadio and Mediabase in order for it to be eligible for airplay for most stations and so that it could be tracked on the Billboards. BDSRadio has a list of radio stations they service on their website, so I pulled that list, filtered the list to my song's genre, and created a master spreadsheet of radio stations and their contact information. I made sure to check the station's website first to see if they had a submission system already set up. If they did, I submitted the song through that system. If they did not, I created a standard email script, then modified it slightly to personalize it by including the recipient's name, station's name, and show's name if there was a specific show I was targeting. In the email, I attached a 256 kbps, meta-tagged mp3 radio-edited version of the song (less than 430), a biography, the single's cover art inline at the bottom of the email, and my EPK inline at the bottom. Once my song was released, I modified it to include a few streaming links for convenience.  I found that most stations did not consider my song until it was already released. I re-submitted my song to stations I had emailed prior to release and received airplay almost immediately. I also found that I was more successful when I emailed during business hours on weekdays as opposed to in the evening or on the weekends. This is probably because the recipients are sitting at their desk with their emails open when my submission pops up. Most radio stations actually notified me that they were adding my song. Only one station, the national one, aired my song without notice. I sent my submission emails to the station's main contact email. If I did not get a response, I then submitted it Programming Directors. If I still didn't get a response, I submitted them to radio hosts directly and asked if the song can be aired on their specific show.  2. **Apple Music Stats** 122 plays, 6 Average Daily Listeners, 19 Shazams, 122 Radio Spins, 2 Song Purchases. **How I was able to achieve this** I created promo graphics and uploaded them to all of my social media accounts. I used the ""boost post"" options on Facebook and Instagram to promote my songs starting 3 weeks before release, and everyday the week after the release. I believe those 19 Shazams came from airing on the national radio station.  3. **Spotify Stats** 210 streams, 139 Monthly Listeners, 1.304 Streams/Listener, 8 saves, 8 playlist adds. **How I was able to achieve this** I researched Spotify playlists and identified ones that looked like my song would be a good fit for. A lot of the playlisters I found did not have contact information in their bios. But the ones that did, I found them on Instagram and sent a sweet, personalized message raving about how awesome their playlist was and how I would love for my single to be considered for it. 87% of my Spotify streams came from the user-created playlists I was added to. 4. **YouTube Stats** 136 views, 5.2 watch hours, 85 unique viewers, 10 likes, 0 dislikes. **How I was able to achieve this** My dad played a heavy role in this and sent my song to a lot of my family and friends lol. Also, most of these views came from Facebook after I had created a boosted post containing the song's YouTube link.  I really hope this helps someone! I'm open to any questions anyone may have as well.","the other week i made a post that my single got approved on a relatively larger playlist via submithub after the first attempt. i promised an update once the single had been released, so here it is!  my song did not actually make it onto this playlist until yesterday evening (6 days post-release), so the data i'm about to share with you is independent of this curator's playlist. the curator did also let me know yesterday that it is scheduled to be on there for 21 days, which was nice of him to let me know. i want to share how my single is doing as well as what i've been doing to obtain the numbers i've been able to obtain.  some quick background on me i have 2 previously released singles from 2019 that did not do well (only people that listened to them were my mom and me lol). they were self-produced, self-mixed/mastered, and just were overall not of industry standard quality. i do not have a large following or fanbase for my music by any means. before last week, i had 0 listeners on apple music and 1 monthly listener on spotify. with this single, i hired some of the best musicians/producers in the industry to produce the music and mix for me after sending in my demo. i did my own vocals and had some friends help with bgvs.   1. **radio** 12 radio station adds (1 national, 2 local, 8 internet) and 44 radio spins (only includes what i was able to personally track). **how i was able to achieve this** i registered/encoded my song through bdsradio and mediabase in order for it to be eligible for airplay for most stations and so that it could be tracked on the billboards. bdsradio has a list of radio stations they service on their website, so i pulled that list, filtered the list to my song's genre, and created a master spreadsheet of radio stations and their contact information. i made sure to check the station's website first to see if they had a submission system already set up. if they did, i submitted the song through that system. if they did not, i created a standard email script, then modified it slightly to personalize it by including the recipient's name, station's name, and show's name if there was a specific show i was targeting. in the email, i attached a 256 kbps, meta-tagged mp3 radio-edited version of the song (less than 430), a biography, the single's cover art inline at the bottom of the email, and my epk inline at the bottom. once my song was released, i modified it to include a few streaming links for convenience.  i found that most stations did not consider my song until it was already released. i re-submitted my song to stations i had emailed prior to release and received airplay almost immediately. i also found that i was more successful when i emailed during business hours on weekdays as opposed to in the evening or on the weekends. this is probably because the recipients are sitting at their desk with their emails open when my submission pops up. most radio stations actually notified me that they were adding my song. only one station, the national one, aired my song without notice. i sent my submission emails to the station's main contact email. if i did not get a response, i then submitted it programming directors. if i still didn't get a response, i submitted them to radio hosts directly and asked if the song can be aired on their specific show.  2. **apple music stats** 122 plays, 6 average daily listeners, 19 shazams, 122 radio spins, 2 song purchases. **how i was able to achieve this** i created promo graphics and uploaded them to all of my social media accounts. i used the ""boost post"" options on facebook and instagram to promote my songs starting 3 weeks before release, and everyday the week after the release. i believe those 19 shazams came from airing on the national radio station.  3. **spotify stats** 210 streams, 139 monthly listeners, 1.304 streams/listener, 8 saves, 8 playlist adds. **how i was able to achieve this** i researched spotify playlists and identified ones that looked like my song would be a good fit for. a lot of the playlisters i found did not have contact information in their bios. but the ones that did, i found them on instagram and sent a sweet, personalized message raving about how awesome their playlist was and how i would love for my single to be considered for it. 87% of my spotify streams came from the user-created playlists i was added to. 4. **youtube stats** 136 views, 5.2 watch hours, 85 unique viewers, 10 likes, 0 dislikes. **how i was able to achieve this** my dad played a heavy role in this and sent my song to a lot of my family and friends lol. also, most of these views came from facebook after i had created a boosted post containing the song's youtube link.  i really hope this helps someone! i'm open to any questions anyone may have as well.",19,864

I submitted a lofi track to Submithub, and someone asked me for a Spotify link so they can add it to a playlist.

But, as I understood it, there are two ways of adding songs on Spotify: 

1) You can download your own songs from your computer into your Spotify library and create playlists and (?) share the playlist after. But you can't share individual songs links. 

2) You have to use a distribution music service like Distrokid and so many others... and then, you are able to share individual song links and your song can be added to playlists.

Am I correct? Can anyone confirm? Thank you.

Btw, I wouldn't mind getting some advice about the best music distribution services outhere, in your opinion ;)

To some of yall this might be obvious (if so scroll on!), but this is for those in the thread who don't know, we wanted to remind everyone websites which are made specifically for submitting to playlists:

&amp;#x200B;

Dailyplaylists

&amp;#x200B;

You signup with your spotify account, can submit your songs (and playlists if over 100 followers) to loads of different genre playlists. You get 25 free submissions every week so it's a quick 5 min way to regularly share your music with curators! If you're a playlisters with over 100 followers too you can host your playlist on the website, easily get more followers and have a system which allows you to scroll through submissions and add them easily on the website.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Submithub

Now this one is a little more work! You get new credits everytime you check in to the website (daily), and you can spend 1-3 credits to submit to playlists, channels and blogs. Sometimes curators can be a bit harsh on there but DONT BE DISCOURAGED, it's a daily practice which doesn't take too long if you're looking for another place to share your songs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, as you all know we offer a completely free list of playlist curators and how to submit to them [HERE](https://www.toneden.io/echo-uk/post/spotify-playlists), so if you want to do it the classic way (email. dm or form) you can use this too.",9,0.84,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lofi_Beats_Submission/comments/tsvpma/the_basics_for_submitting_your_music_if_you_dont/,THE BASICS FOR SUBMITTING YOUR MUSIC!

t17iuw,1645805199.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,shadowtrap,Submithub experience for indie band,"Our band just released our first 'commercial' ep and I decided to give submithub a try to see what the process is like and if it's worth it for us.

I've seen mixed reviews here but wanted to see for myself.

We submitted to 18 outlets. 

I specifically targeted outlets primarily with decent Spotify playlist monthly listens and only those with at least a score of 7 for genre match.  I also included some blogs if they were a good match and their description sounded appropriate for us.  I spent about an hour going through the curator options to identify the best matches for our music.

I spent $30 for 30 credits and used 29 of them.

By the end of the 48 hours, we received feedback from 17 of the 18 outlets.

They were all declines unfortunately, but I did find the feedback pretty interesting.  Most reviewers listened to the whole song, some more than once.  There is an interface on submithub where you can see exactly when and how long each curator listened which is cool.

As far as the quality of the feedback, I was mostly satisfied as most provided enough information to indicate they paid attention.


Some feedback said the mix needed work, some thought it was perfect for our style.  Several loved the vocals and one said they couldn't finish the song because of the vocals.  Some loved the guitar and chord choices, some said they were uninteresting.  A few loved the lyrics, some said they were too repetitive. Some really enjoyed the arrangement for the vibe, some found it stale.   Some disputed the genre or made suggestions about where we might fit better.

While it may sound like the feedback is not useful, I actually think it is.  Some curators were clearly not a fan of the style in general and therefore while it's worth noting their criticisms, if it's something about the identity of the music as a whole it's probably fair to disregard. However when some highlight areas they really enjoyed that are conscious design decisions, and also shared specific criticisms they felt lacking, I think this information is pretty useful.


I will say the service is probably most useful if your music fits clearly into an established genre.

As an 'indie rock' band, you could be Soccer Mommy or Pavement and still be under that same genre label where people may love one style and hate the other.

Still, based on the feedback from this go around I think we could narrow the focus if we decided to do it again and I would strongly consider it.


My verdict is that it's a decent way to get feedback from the modern day gatekeepers and see how you stack up to the expectations they have. It can be eye opening.  If you're specifically looking to maximize your  marketing money I don't know that it's the best way to go and probably wouldn't recommend it.

Essentially, you listen to submissions and decide if it's a good fit for any playlists, but the interesting thing was: 

THEY ARE INCENTIVIZED TO LISTEN FOR AS LITTLE TIME AS POSSIBLE

Why does this matter?: 

If your track has a 10 second intro, or even a 5 second intro, that doesn't immediately grip them, it's likely they're gonna pass on your song. They get paid per submission listened to, so if they take their time to listen all the way through each song, they won't be making much money. 

This is not to say, ""you should write songs that start with the chorus right away"", but it is important to note that if your ""best song"" starts out with a bit of an intro, perhaps that's why you're struggling to get on playlists. I'm not sure that this applies to every single playlister on SubmitHub, but I'd imagine the incentive is similar, to get through as many submissions as possible as quickly as possible.

They get paid per submission listened to, so if they take their time to listen all the way through each song, they won't be making much money.  This is not to say, ""you should write songs that start with the chorus right away"", but it is important to note that if your ""best song"" starts out with a bit of an intro, perhaps that's why you're struggling to get on playlists. I'm not sure that this applies to every single playlister on SubmitHub, but I'd imagine the incentive is similar, to get through as many submissions as possible as quickly as possible.  TLDR; if you wanna get your song into a playlist, make sure it starts out strong within the first 5 seconds.","so, this may not be of huge news for anyone, but i recently stumbled across a job listing for a ""music blob submissions assistant"".  essentially, you listen to submissions and decide if it's a good fit for any playlists, but the interesting thing was  they are incentivized to listen for as little time as possible why does this matter?  if your track has a 10 second intro, or even a 5 second intro, that doesn't immediately grip them, it's likely they're gonna pass on your song. they get paid per submission listened to, so if they take their time to listen all the way through each song, they won't be making much money.  this is not to say, ""you should write songs that start with the chorus right away"", but it is important to note that if your ""best song"" starts out with a bit of an intro, perhaps that's why you're struggling to get on playlists. i'm not sure that this applies to every single playlister on submithub, but i'd imagine the incentive is similar, to get through as many submissions as possible as quickly as possible.  tldr; if you wanna get your song into a playlist, make sure it starts out strong within the first 5 seconds.",10,209

I wanted to test it out so I did not spend a lot of money (bought 30 credits which is $27 USD) and split it evenly between curators and submitting to the hot or not section. 

For curators I targeted exclusively playlists that matched my music style (pop-punk/Indie Rock). I submitted to 12 playlists and was approved for 3 of them with another placing me on a smaller playlist. I was reasonably happy by this as I had heard horror stories of getting denied across the board and feel like targeting really helped with my higher success rate.

I found the hot or not section to be very helpful as I submitted my track to be rated by 50 separate premium users of the site, mainly fellow musicians. I initially was concerned I might get dragged as that section has a reputation for sometimes being grouchy but I was very happy with the results. Overall many users were positive and some even added the tracks to their own library and playlists with the less positive reviews giving me honest areas where I could improve that I will take to heart.

I used this strategy to get onto a playlist that got my LoFi song to over 25K streams on Spotify. It made me some of that Spotify stream money (which is pretty rare) but there are two main things that I would like to point out:

Submithub is a platform which connects music creators with playlist owners and influencers. In exchange for a dollar (or two or three) you get a chance to get your Spotify track playlisted (or shouted out by an influencer.)

Most of the time it feels like I’m at Vegas pumping money into a slot machine as most of the playlists you get on have minimal listeners or they have a time limit for how long you are on them. But this method that I used ensured that I got some of that money back. Two things to notice.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I made sure my music fit on the friendly-genre list. This is a list that helps you determine which playlists have a high acceptance rate to their specific playlist. LoFi typically racks up around 45%. It’s a good genre to get playlisted.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I made certain that when I found a playlist that was getting me consistent streams that I found out where that playlist owner was most of the time and I did a little bit of stalking. They had a link on their website which allowed me to submit to them directly as opposed to through Submithub which they preferred.

They had a link on their website which allowed me to submit to them directly as opposed to through Submithub which they preferred. One thing you must know before going on Submithub. It is a grind and you will get an ego-check in terms of how many times you will be rejected. So keep that in mind and have fun with it. Hit me up if you have any questions., i thought i’d share my story about using submit hub to get me streams specifically on a lofi track that i produced earlier this year. i used this strategy to get onto a playlist that got my lofi song to over 25k streams on spotify. it made me some of that spotify stream money (which is pretty rare) but there are two main things that i would like to point out submithub is a platform which connects music creators with playlist owners and influencers. in exchange for a dollar (or two or three) you get a chance to get your spotify track playlisted (or shouted out by an influencer.) most of the time it feels like i’m at vegas pumping money into a slot machine as most of the playlists you get on have minimal listeners or they have a time limit for how long you are on them. but this method that i used ensured that i got some of that money back. two things to notice. &x200b; 1. i made sure my music fit on the friendly-genre list. this is a list that helps you determine which playlists have a high acceptance rate to their specific playlist. lofi typically racks up around 45%. it’s a good genre to get playlisted. &x200b; 1. i made certain that when i found a playlist that was getting me consistent streams that i found out where that playlist owner was most of the time and i did a little bit of stalking. they had a link on their website which allowed me to submit to them directly as opposed to through submithub which they preferred. one thing you must know before going on submithub. it is a grind and you will get an ego-check in terms of how many times you will be rejected. so keep that in mind and have fun with it. hit me up if you have any questions.,4,320

rkqzq1,1640017375.0,musicmarketing,Strong_March_9922,How do you actually get on big YouTube channels and Spotify playlists?,"Hi!

I'm an electronic producer with a decent following for a small independent artist. I also promote my music myself and invest quite some time into reading, learning and trying things in this regard. I'm ready to accept critique and don't consider myself particularly ground breaking, but at the same time I'm pretty self demanding, and also know what my music is worth. All those thousands of subscribers I have are completely organic, no stuff like ""hey cool track check out my track"" was involved. For further context, let's consider it decent, not worse than average stuff you hear on a YT channel like Car Music or Super Cool House Music.

The most difficult part for me is understanding how everything works. I have budget for marketing, but I hardly understand where to apply it because 95% of emails I send get ignored. Only once I was able to get featured on a moderately big YT channel/Spotify playlist for a clearly communicated ""fee"" and at this point I'm fine with a process like this. The problem is that if I want to get featured on a really big channel, say 1 or more million of real subscribers - I get ignored.

I take my time and write personalized emails, mention something about the channel, explain why my track would fit, keep it short and friendly, provide convenient demo links, send follow ups and so on. I even see the play counter on the private demo change, so somebody somewhere does listen to it, yet no reply (even though I totally accept an adequate ""no"").

A separate thing goes for SubmitHub. If you didn't know, it was created by a guy whose music blog was made irrelevant by Spotify's emergence. Now this whole service looks like a source of easy money for blogs authors and playlists curators. Nothing actually makes the curators accept tracks, theoretically they can refuse 100% submissions and still earn the money. As I see it, there's no interest for them to accept anything, unless they are really in need of new music at the moment or something. I have tried SubmitHub with a bunch of different tracks, genres and blogs and haven't got a single feature. When I ask for detailed feedback I get unprofessional copy-paste like ""I didn't like the guitar"" with no elaboration, so it doesn't really help. I even had a conversation with the platform creator and he took time to say that he's not impressed with one of my tracks either, even though I didn't ask for his opinion.

I'm sorry for the frustrated tone of my post, well I am frustrated, but I'm really willing to understand how are you supposed to approach this. When I didn't have the production quality, I thought I have to work on it first. When I didn't have money for marketing, I thought I need it first. Now I have both and still no luck, and this is confusing.

Have anyone had any positive experience in what I'm trying to achieve? Can you confirm my current theory that it's possible only through knowing somebody right personally? Any ideas and suggestions are welcome.

TLDR: I can't get featured on big YT channels even though I have decent music, marketing budget and follow best email marketing practices when building my communication. I get no replies on multiple attempts and am looking for advice or additional information on how to approach this kind of challenge.",10,1.0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicmarketing/comments/rkqzq1/how_do_you_actually_get_on_big_youtube_channels/,How do you actually get on big YouTube channels and Spotify playlists?,how do you actually get on big youtube channels and spotify playlists?,"Hi!

Most Spotify playlists which will put your song in are either fake or ask for money (and at the same time they are also likely fake).

Socials are also growing VERY slowly unless you have HUNDREDS of pounds/dollars to throw into ads (which I don't).

rf219i,1639354000.0,musicmarketing,nick_minieri,Zero luck using facebook ads to promote underground house/uk garage releases - any advice?,"Hey there - been an active reader of this sub for awhile now. Having some difficulty running facebook ads to promote several of my recent releases, and wanted to discuss to see if it's a common problem vs something on my end that I'm doing wrong.

Basically I had a deep house release come out last month and a uk garage one several days ago. Set up a $20/day conversion campaign (that I turned down to $5 after a few days) for both with budget optimization turned on, and then did multiple ad sets for each of them. Each set had audiences set to all tier 1 and most tier 2 countries, with detail targeting set to people who like spotify plus both the genre and different similar artist for each set. 

This is where I began running into problems because deep house and uk garage are too niche to even show up, and neither do specific artists in those categories (such as todd edwards or mj cole for garage, mall grab for lo-fi house) so it's a challenge to narrow down my target audience.

For each set I have custom made banners (I know the basics of After Effects so can do somewhat decent animated ones) that has all the important release info pop up quickly on them. I'll edit the banners slightly different for each set, with different sections of the song, to test to see which ones perform better. I also only run ads on facebook and instagram stories. Toneden is set up as the landing page, with a custom URL.

On the Toneden page I can see that I'm getting traffic, but I'm getting close to zero plays when checking my daily spotify analytics. For the november release almost all the plays are coming from the playlists I was added to on submithub, which I actually had decent luck with. I can't even get the conversion rates to under $1.00 per conversion, which I know is really bad.

Is it harder in general to run ads on niche, lesser known styles of music using facebook ads? As an unknown artist I'm obviously not expecting tens of thousands of daily plays, but am surprised I'm not even getting a small handful. I know some people who do more commercial styles of music with vocals have luck, and am well aware of the fact it could be my music just isn't there yet quality-wise. But am curious to see other people's experiences with it in niche genres.

Thx in advance, looking forward to hearing your observations!","hey there - been an active reader of this sub for awhile now. having some difficulty running facebook ads to promote several of my recent releases, and wanted to discuss to see if it's a common problem vs something on my end that i'm doing wrong. basically i had a deep house release come out last month and a uk garage one several days ago. set up a $20/day conversion campaign (that i turned down to $5 after a few days) for both with budget optimization turned on, and then did multiple ad sets for each of them. each set had audiences set to all tier 1 and most tier 2 countries, with detail targeting set to people who like spotify plus both the genre and different similar artist for each set.  this is where i began running into problems because deep house and uk garage are too niche to even show up, and neither do specific artists in those categories (such as todd edwards or mj cole for garage, mall grab for lo-fi house) so it's a challenge to narrow down my target audience. for each set i have custom made banners (i know the basics of after effects so can do somewhat decent animated ones) that has all the important release info pop up quickly on them. i'll edit the banners slightly different for each set, with different sections of the song, to test to see which ones perform better. i also only run ads on facebook and instagram stories. toneden is set up as the landing page, with a custom url. on the toneden page i can see that i'm getting traffic, but i'm getting close to zero plays when checking my daily spotify analytics. for the november release almost all the plays are coming from the playlists i was added to on submithub, which i actually had decent luck with. i can't even get the conversion rates to under $1.00 per conversion, which i know is really bad. is it harder in general to run ads on niche, lesser known styles of music using facebook ads? as an unknown artist i'm obviously not expecting tens of thousands of daily plays, but am surprised i'm not even getting a small handful. i know some people who do more commercial styles of music with vocals have luck, and am well aware of the fact it could be my music just isn't there yet quality-wise. but am curious to see other people's experiences with it in niche genres. thx in advance, looking forward to hearing your observations!",14,428

&amp;#x200B;

I released an EP on a completely new project about 4 months ago. I've exhausted every curator on submithub and have found it moderately successful. All in all, I've gotten placed on a few dozen playlists and have a couple thousand streams along with a nice word on a blog here and there.

At this point I feel like my current trajectory has run its course. I fee like I haven't really been super successful at building an organic base of followers, which is step 1 if I ever want to really see some growth.

What did you do to establish a core following? I'm open to any suggestions.

rc57r1,1639010042.0,musicpromoscams,Practical-Lifeguard4,A General Guide To The World of Film Syncs,"I started this group to showcase potential misleading information in the music scene. However, I feel there's a space for simply explaining some cold hard facts on certain topics. People ask me about how to get music in TV and film all the time, so, this is a general guide on how to get started, and clearing up popular misconceptions perpetuated by many marketing gurus.

Real quick, I am signed non-exclusively to two Nashville based film sync libraries.  [Washington Street Publishing](https://sites.google.com/site/washingtonstreetpublishing/home) and [Incorporated Elements](https://www.incorporatedelements.com/) however, I have also been in several Christian owned libraries and since left as I feel the worship music scene is too limiting for my goals  and style.

**1) Money** It is a common misunderstanding that once acquiring a film sync, you'll make a bunch of money, garner a bunch of clout, and actualize your first ""break"" in the industry. This is a horrid mindset that needs to be let go of immediately.

**1,a)** On average syncs pay from as little as $500 to a high end of $15,000. That being said, the most common ones you'll find with be for roughly $2,000, give or take. This more often than not is far from the amount you'll get.

**1,b)** It's standard for publishers to take 30, to even 50%. This is not ownership of your masters. It's a non-exclusive, usually year to year contract for the song to be in the library, and only applies to any income directly from placements secured by the publishing company.

**1,c)** These payout through a Creative Pro such as [ASCAP](https://www.ascap.com/) or [BMI](https://www.bmi.com/). They tend to take a loooonnnggg time to get to you. From the day you heard about it, expect it to take six months to several years to get paid for the single sync.

**2) Need for Music** *""There is a constant need for music, every day they need new tracks.""* Chances are if you heard someone hype you up by the sheer volume of music needed on a daily basis for massive Hollywood films, it's someone making money selling info, not making music.

Yes, there is a never ending need of music, because of the always releasing new content from tv shows, large YouTube projects, films, video games, ads, etc. ***This is only a half truth.***

**2,a)** For every one song that is needed, there are hundreds, if not thousands of artists, at the ready, with dozens of albums waiting for placement. The songs and artists outnumber the available slots to an almost comical level. Not everyone is going to just get work trying to get it. Assume nothing.

**3) Style** Yes, sometimes a specific song is needed for a film, or show, but the majority of the work is custom instrumentals. This is not the same as writing, producing, and releasing music on YouTube and  Spotify. It's essentially film composition, and if you don't know how to do that, you need to learn before wasting time and money on attempting to license music for tv and film.

**3,a)** Get a DAW that allows you to sync footage with your piano roll, and do some tests with stock footage, or remove the audio from a trailer, and try to score it. Even if you know how to, if you've never done it professionally, or consistently for other projects, you need to practice first. Don't get ahead of yourself.

**3,b)** College films are a good place to start, small youtubers/animators/game devs. Stop trying to run before you can walk over here. There is no magical way to go from wondering to making money with this next month. It does not happen.

**4) Quality** The music has to be top noth. There are terms, *""radio ready""* and *""broadcast ready""* sound. This means the song itself is quite literally, ready to be played on major rotation, or in feature films, etc. For major broadcast. Are you that good? It's a valid question.

**4,a)** I have made well over 1,000 songs in the last year. I have roughly 50 songs that are singed non exclusively. The majority of my music is instrumental, and I only have one song that's ever been approved for anything, that has vocals.

**5) Social Media** Your clout can not help you here. This has absolutely nothing to do with your YouTube account, insta, Spotify. nobody cares. Get it straight-- you do not even need profiles on these services. This is about a specific project, that is in need of a specific song. Imagine your song being perfect, exactly what's needed, but they deny it, and spend more time and money finding one just like it...but..has a verified 100k YouTube. How does that change the song, as heard, in the movie? Be realistic. ***Whoever says socials matter, has no idea what they are talking about, and is essentially a con artist.***

**6) Music Supervisor, Songpluggers, Sync Agents**

**6,a)** A Music supervisor is the person working on the film, tasked with finding and licensing the music for the film.

**6,b)** A Sync Agent, is someone working at a music library, or who has and acquires music to be pre cleared to license out when a music supervisor is in need of music.

**6,c)** A songplugger is most often the role of someone who searches for unknown tracks, or has tracks written, to license out to other artists or companies in need of original music, lyrics, or any combination of musical production.

**7) Cold emailing those mentioned above.** *DO NOT EVER DO THIS. READ IT AGAIN. NO, NO, NO, NO, AND NO. STOP.* I do not care what Adam Ivy or anyone else on YouTube selling courses tells you. This is a one way ticket to being blacklisted, it can literally end your career before it begins. It's very serious.

**7,a)** Scroll back up and look at the two music libraries I mentioned, directly on the site, they say not to contact them. Think of it like a major label. You do not send submissions to them, they contact you.

**7,b)** Do not contact these people on any social media, and do not try to fool them into listening to your music. This is harassment, and cyber stalking. Again, hitting up a manager of Atlantic on LinkedIn doesn't change the fact you are contacting the label. Do not do it.

**7,c)** ***YOU WILL BE BLACKLISTED. I'M SORRY BUT I SEE THIS EVERY DAY IT'S THE MOST UNPROFESSIONAL, MORONIC ADVICE ANYONE COULD POSSIBLY GIVE.***

**8) How to do it.** Super simple answer you don't want to hear. You don't.

**8,a)** Get better, and make professional grade music, and be able to do it in less than an hour, over and over again, every day.

**8,b)** Worm your way into the industry. Attend film conventions, Make connections in person. Go to conventions showcasing new camera equipment, mics, lights, etc, network, network, network.

**8,c)** Pay to submit, and be mindful that it rarely does much of anything, and is usually a waste of time, and money.

That's it. Basically, be realistic, get good, and network. Sorry to break it everyone, that's all there is to know (in my opinion) I apologize if you've been mislead or told otherwise for someone else's financial gain, or to boost their metrics on a social media platform.

9) **Grain of Salt...** Like SubmitHub, you're going to roll your eyes, think the person you are talking to is an idiot, and get very angry at the feedback. Let it go.

Still, it's worth trying to learn — so if someone gives you feedback that the bass and voice are ""so under-mixed"" what do you think they mean?

For context, this was a radio outlet that claimed to be ""eclectic"" in their description, but in the feedback they asserted they were a pop and mainstream radio so it's likely a conflict in styles between that and a more vintage sounding jazz track.

qz4o99,1637529473.0,musicmarketing,westaiko,Advice having exhausted all means of marketing,"Hello! Reaching out to y'all about any alternative successful strategies you've had to getting your music out there and heard.

For some context, we're a 3 piece DIY indie/alt rock band that's been really trying to push to get our music out there. We've been together for about 5 years but only really seriously started trying to get our music out there in the past 2 or so years. We have less than 150 followers on IG, 35 subs on Youtube and just getting start with Tik Tok. We've done everything that's talked about out there from setting up proper facebook targeted ad campaigns to putting together a social media campaign across all networks (tik tok, IG reels, youtube), working Spotify profiles and playlists, and putting together SubmitHub campaigns. We've put out 4 singles now, each time we really put a lot of effort into improving not only our marketing strategy but our recording, musicianship and production. 

All said and done, I feel like with everything our growth is so slow that it's not worth any of the effort we've been putting into any of it. Honestly, social media and marketing is really not our strong suit so we've just been trying to find as much advice as we can through reddit and youtube and put together a strategy that works for us. 

I'd like to put out some on our experiences with various strategies. Just curious what y'all think or if you have any suggestions.

**Facebook Ads**

Not worth it at all (IG as well). Unless you're a major act with a good following to work the algorithms no one who sees your ad is going to care. It probably takes some more clever manipulation of the content of your ad but unless you're paying someone experienced to do this for you then it's probably a waste of time and money.

**Tik Tok and Reels for reach**

Using things like Tik Tok and IG reels to get instant reach is something we've been trying more and honestly still just trying to find an identity and what works for us there. I think one of our hang ups here is that basically you have to be okay with putting out stuff you may not be happy with creatively but if you're spending more than a few hours throwing it together you're wasting time. We like to put a lot of time and effort into our work so this goes against everything that makes us comfortable. But we are trying. Not sure how this will work out for us yet.

**Social Media Engagement**

This part kills me lol but posting stories everyday about whatever is not really in our personality so it's really hard to maintain consistency here. But we have found ways to maintain posts at least on a weekly basis like curating our own playlists and shouting out bands or songs on our stories that we at least find interesting. This is something that is at the very least  fun for us but we still  really struggle here overall.

**Playlisting and SubmitHub/Playlist Push**

We only care about growing organically and will never go near any of those playlist scams. Streams counts also don't matter to us at all. However SubmitHub for us at least seem legit in the beginning. More recently I feel like curators there are just there to take their credits in exchange for some nice words about your song. But in the end they just say something generic like ""sorry but just not quite enough for us."" Our experience here isn't all bad. We've been playlisted only a few times (in our first song of all songs) and found a blog who wrote an excellent article about us. But even with those there didn't seem to be much of a return on our investment. We were feeling best about our most recent song but we've had zero success on SubmitHub despite success in the past.

I've looked into playlist push to automate this process a bit since I'm starting to get an identity crisis and wondering if I'm even targeting the right curators based on our genre on submit hub. Ultimately, the cost for a campaign on playlist push doesn't seem worth it...$200+ for getting exposed to only about 20 curators seems ridiculous to me.

**Spotify** 

Still trying to do all the things Spotify suggests you do...playlist pitch your song a month in advance, maintain your profile page and artists playlists. Haven't really seen any success here yet either but I feel like all you can really do is just keep at it and just hope it pays dividends later. It's ultimately not a whole lot of effort to do so it's the least we can do out of anything.

**YouTube**

At this point I feel like this is the outlet or platform is where we feel most comfortable. I think it's just about putting together more quality long form content and various types of a videos for your song...Visualizers, Music Videos, Performance Videos, Covers...we're going to attempt to do lyric videos and Behind the Scenes videos...but I feel like these are only more interesting once you have a reasonable following. But youtube is where I get the most gratification for the amount of work put in at least. And seems like sometimes you may get lucky with the suggestions algorithm. I haven't really considered Youtube Ads but who ever really watches those anyway...I even pay for Premium just to not have them on the videos I watch. But I've never tried an ad campaign there so not sure if anyone else has had success. No one ever really seems to suggest this as the way to go either.

\---

Anyways, sorry this ended up being so long winded. But if anyone has any alternative platforms or strategies that have worked for getting that initial growth I'm all ears.

(TLDR   do you make music, would you like to take part in a (free) podcast series?) 


I'm a mature student of Audio Production and as part of my course this year I am required to deliver a creative portfolio concept.

What I have decided to do is compile a series of podcasts that are aimed at engaging with producers, listen to one of your tracks (not review it) talk about it, your identity as a producer /artist, journey, philosophy, aims, purpose, preferred gear etc... among other things, running to 20 to 30 minutes each, (I'm still fleshing out the format) 

The series will be broadcast part of  the college's online radio show and uploaded to the usual suspects, and if the concept gets enough participant interest will run bi monthly over at least the next 2 years, and if it really takes off, will be a feature of the radio production courses the college offers.

We will be building a playlist too both for Spotify and the radio show in general.  There is no cost involved, all totally voluntary. 

I'm keen to understand what level of interest there would be in getting involved as an interviewee and taking part is some questionnaires and pre interview research discussions on the format, it's value to the listener, and participant. 

Level of experience isn't important, though my preference is towards those that are earlier on in their hobby / career as indies, amateurs and tinkerers, though professionals are welcome too, and would/could serve as inspirational discussions/features 

I am aware I could just sign up as a curator at submithub or similar and may well do, but initially would like to structure something a bit more personal and more interested in the person and mindset than the music, if you see what I mean?

 

If you have any thoughts and opinions, please do share them in the comments as any answer is valuable and will be a valid contribution to the discussion and my research. 

Thank you and hopefully we'll speak soon.

(tldr   do you make music, would you like to take part in a (free) podcast series?)  i'm a mature student of audio production and as part of my course this year i am required to deliver a creative portfolio concept. what i have decided to do is compile a series of podcasts that are aimed at engaging with producers, listen to one of your tracks (not review it) talk about it, your identity as a producer /artist, journey, philosophy, aims, purpose, preferred gear etc... among other things, running to 20 to 30 minutes each, (i'm still fleshing out the format)  the series will be broadcast part of  the college's online radio show and uploaded to the usual suspects, and if the concept gets enough participant interest will run bi monthly over at least the next 2 years, and if it really takes off, will be a feature of the radio production courses the college offers. we will be building a playlist too both for spotify and the radio show in general.  there is no cost involved, all totally voluntary.  i'm keen to understand what level of interest there would be in getting involved as an interviewee and taking part is some questionnaires and pre interview research discussions on the format, it's value to the listener, and participant.  level of experience isn't important, though my preference is towards those that are earlier on in their hobby / career as indies, amateurs and tinkerers, though professionals are welcome too, and would/could serve as inspirational discussions/features  i am aware i could just sign up as a curator at submithub or similar and may well do, but initially would like to structure something a bit more personal and more interested in the person and mindset than the music, if you see what i mean?   if you have any thoughts and opinions, please do share them in the comments as any answer is valuable and will be a valid contribution to the discussion and my research.  thank you and hopefully we'll speak soon.  rk x",6,348

qi68sh,1635487970.0,musicmarketing,iplaythelaptop,Manipulating Spotify Streams with Streaming Fraud: Here’s What Can Happen," The current era of music consumption is heavily dominated by streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music. Music distribution has become easier and very efficient, and almost every song is available to everyone across the globe. Streaming is a process that, on paper, proves to be a win-win situation for everyone involved. The artist is paid more as their **Spotify streams** increase, while the listener can listen to any song without going through the hassle of downloading it beforehand. However, with the number of streams also acting as some sort of a status symbol, a lot of naive indie artists have been getting tempted to try it, and streaming fraud is becoming more and more commonplace in the industry. However, it can easily ruin the trajectory of an artist’s career. 

## What is Streaming Fraud?

Streaming fraud refers to illegal practices that can be used by artists to increase their **Spotify streams** or forge the statistics on a streaming platform like Spotify. In this, artists pay for streams that are registered by bots or even real people hired to stream tracks, also known as ‘artificial streams.’  This is a very common phrase in the music industry and is also often referred to as ‘streaming manipulation,’ ‘store-end fraud,’ and ‘abnormal streaming activity.’ The problem with streaming fraud runs even deeper than buying illegal music. In some cases, you might not even realize that you are partaking in streaming fraud. Several independent playlist curators claim to be legitimate but are actually using illegal methods to increase **Spotify streams** for its customers. You should always research a Spotify playlist curator before paying them for consideration to their playlists and use only reputable services like SubmitHub, PlaylistPush and StreamCatcher to pitch your music. Buying fake **Spotify streams** is becoming increasingly commonplace. There are a lot of popular third-party sites that offer to provide artists with a specific amount of streams and **Spotify playlist** placements in exchange for money. These parties, then, usually generate fake streams using bots. And even though it has become easier for people to manipulate streaming, Spotify has been working very hard to try and implement measures to control it and to be a safer space for genuine artists.    

## Why Streaming Fraud Isn’t Worth It  

### 1. You Can be Suspended or Removed

With cases of streaming frauds rising, streaming platforms have been taking measures to prevent and punish streaming frauds routinely. If it is ever found that your account has done any illegal activities to increase your streams, strict action can be taken against you. Once you have been caught, your account can be suspended for a long time or, in some cases, be deleted permanently. This will lead you to start the process of distributing music from scratch. If you’re any serious about having a long-term career as a musician, this just isn’t worth the risk.   

### 2. You Lose Your Reliability

A higher number of **Spotify streams** does not mean you are more talented or have a higher chance of becoming successful than other musicians, and fans usually pick up on that. In fact, it can often mean the opposite. If you send your music to a label and they find out that your streams are not real (it’s often obvious), you lose your credibility as an artist. This will hamper your future and might ruin your career. The label can also share this information with the industry making it almost impossible for you to gain footing again. Again, just not worth it.  

### 3. It is Illegal and There Are Safer Options Out There

At the end of the day, it boils down to the fact that you might just be wasting your time, effort, and money. You can instead use the time and money you'd be spending on these illegal payola sites in a better, more effective way to legally get more streams (and real fans) from your music! Again, make sure you always use a reputable Spotify curator. Other than that, you can research music marketing and learn how to engage more listeners and increase your audience. There will be several services on the internet that will claim that they can increase your streams by large margins, but taking shortcuts in the present can prove to be harmful in the long run.   

### 4. It Relies on Taking Revenue From Other Independent Artists

Lastly but very importantly, the artists on streaming platforms are paid according to the number of streams their music generates. But since the majority of streaming platforms work on a revenue system known as a ‘shared pool,’ getting fake streams also translates into stealing from the pockets of other, more deserving artists. If fake **Spotify streams** are muddling the numbers, the money won’t be given to the small independent artists who deserve it. Here are some other common and effective ways in which you can promote your music instead:

* Promoting your music on social media via TikToks, Reels and YouTube Shorts
* Promoting your music with the help of Facebook ads
* Pitching your songs to **Spotify editorial playlists** *(during the time of release)*
* Using Spotify For Artist' countless tools to promote your new releases
* Pitch your music to **user-generated** playlists

You might think that fake streams are very hard to trace, but that is not the case. Industry professionals can distinguish very easily between real and fraudulent **Spotify streams**. In the future, fake streams will just make it worse for you to get more exposure and growth. So when promoting music, choose what you do wisely and always go for the reliable and trustworthy option. Small mistakes can have long-term consequences, and there is no harm in being extra cautious.",9,1.0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicmarketing/comments/qi68sh/manipulating_spotify_streams_with_streaming_fraud/,Manipulating Spotify Streams with Streaming Fraud Here’s What Can Happen,manipulating spotify streams with streaming fraud here’s what can happen," The current era of music consumption is heavily dominated by streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music.

This will hamper your future and might ruin your career. The label can also share this information with the industry making it almost impossible for you to gain footing again. Again, just not worth it.

At the end of the day, it boils down to the fact that you might just be wasting your time, effort, and money. You can instead use the time and money you'd be spending on these illegal payola sites in a better, more effective way to legally get more streams (and real fans) from your music! Again, make sure you always use a reputable Spotify curator. Other than that, you can research music marketing and learn how to engage more listeners and increase your audience. There will be several services on the internet that will claim that they can increase your streams by large margins, but taking shortcuts in the present can prove to be harmful in the long run.   

### 4. It Relies on Taking Revenue From Other Independent Artists

Lastly but very importantly, the artists on streaming platforms are paid according to the number of streams their music generates. But since the majority of streaming platforms work on a revenue system known as a ‘shared pool,’ getting fake streams also translates into stealing from the pockets of other, more deserving artists. If fake **Spotify streams** are muddling the numbers, the money won’t be given to the small independent artists who deserve it. Here are some other common and effective ways in which you can promote your music instead:

* Promoting your music on social media via TikToks, Reels and YouTube Shorts
* Promoting your music with the help of Facebook ads
* Pitching your songs to **Spotify editorial playlists**  *(during the time of release)*
* Using Spotify For Artist' countless tools to promote your new releases
* Pitch your music to **user-generated** playlists

You might think that fake streams are very hard to trace, but that is not the case. Industry professionals can distinguish very easily between real and fraudulent **Spotify streams**. In the future, fake streams will just make it worse for you to get more exposure and growth. So when promoting music, choose what you do wisely and always go for the reliable and trustworthy option.

Music distribution has become easier and very efficient, and almost every song is available to everyone across the globe. Streaming is a process that, on paper, proves to be a win-win situation for everyone involved. The artist is paid more as their **Spotify streams** increase, while the listener can listen to any song without going through the hassle of downloading it beforehand. However, with the number of streams also acting as some sort of a status symbol, a lot of naive indie artists have been getting tempted to try it, and streaming fraud is becoming more and more commonplace in the industry. However, it can easily ruin the trajectory of an artist’s career.   What is Streaming Fraud? Streaming fraud refers to illegal practices that can be used by artists to increase their **Spotify streams** or forge the statistics on a streaming platform like Spotify. In this, artists pay for streams that are registered by bots or even real people hired to stream tracks, also known as ‘artificial streams.’  This is a very common phrase in the music industry and is also often referred to as ‘streaming manipulation,’ ‘store-end fraud,’ and ‘abnormal streaming activity.’ The problem with streaming fraud runs even deeper than buying illegal music. In some cases, you might not even realize that you are partaking in streaming fraud. Several independent playlist curators claim to be legitimate but are actually using illegal methods to increase **Spotify streams** for its customers. You should always research a Spotify playlist curator before paying them for consideration to their playlists and use only reputable services like SubmitHub, PlaylistPush and StreamCatcher to pitch your music. Buying fake **Spotify streams** is becoming increasingly commonplace. There are a lot of popular third-party sites that offer to provide artists with a specific amount of streams and **Spotify playlist** placements in exchange for money. These parties, then, usually generate fake streams using bots. And even though it has become easier for people to manipulate streaming, Spotify has been working very hard to try and implement measures to control it and to be a safer space for genuine artists.      Why Streaming Fraud Isn’t Worth It    1. You Can be Suspended or Removed With cases of streaming frauds rising, streaming platforms have been taking measures to prevent and punish streaming frauds routinely. If it is ever found that your account has done any illegal activities to increase your streams, strict action can be taken against you. Once you have been caught, your account can be suspended for a long time or, in some cases, be deleted permanently. This will lead you to start the process of distributing music from scratch.

Streaming fraud refers to illegal practices that can be used by artists to increase their **Spotify streams** or forge the statistics on a streaming platform like Spotify. In this, artists pay for streams that are registered by bots or even real people hired to stream tracks, also known as ‘artificial streams.’  This is a very common phrase in the music industry and is also often referred to as ‘streaming manipulation,’ ‘store-end fraud,’ and ‘abnormal streaming activity.’  The problem with streaming fraud runs even deeper than buying illegal music. In some cases, you might not even realize that you are partaking in streaming fraud. Several independent playlist curators claim to be legitimate but are actually using illegal methods to increase **Spotify streams** for its customers. You should always research a Spotify playlist curator before paying them for consideration to their playlists and use only reputable services like SubmitHub, PlaylistPush and StreamCatcher to pitch your music. Buying fake **Spotify streams** is becoming increasingly commonplace. There are a lot of popular third-party sites that offer to provide artists with a specific amount of streams and **Spotify playlist** placements in exchange for money. These parties, then, usually generate fake streams using bots. And even though it has become easier for people to manipulate streaming, Spotify has been working very hard to try and implement measures to control it and to be a safer space for genuine artists.    Why Streaming Fraud Isn’t Worth It  1. You Can be Suspended or Removed With cases of streaming frauds rising, streaming platforms have been taking measures to prevent and punish streaming frauds routinely. If it is ever found that your account has done any illegal activities to increase your streams, strict action can be taken against you. Once you have been caught, your account can be suspended for a long time or, in some cases, be deleted permanently. This will lead you to start the process of distributing music from scratch. If you’re any serious about having a long-term career as a musician, this just isn’t worth the risk.   2. You Lose Your Reliability A higher number of **Spotify streams** does not mean you are more talented or have a higher chance of becoming successful than other musicians, and fans usually pick up on that. In fact, it can often mean the opposite. If you send your music to a label and they find out that your streams are not real (it’s often obvious), you lose your credibility as an artist. This will hamper your future and might ruin your career. The label can also share this information with the industry making it almost impossible for you to gain footing again. Again, just not worth it.  3. It is Illegal and There Are Safer Options Out There At the end of the day, it boils down to the fact that you might just be wasting your time, effort, and money. You can instead use the time and money you'd be spending on these illegal payola sites in a better, more effective way to legally get more streams (and real fans) from your music! Again, make sure you always use a reputable Spotify curator.  Other than that, you can research music marketing and learn how to engage more listeners and increase your audience. There will be several services on the internet that will claim that they can increase your streams by large margins, but taking shortcuts in the present can prove to be harmful in the long run.   4. It Relies on Taking Revenue From Other Independent Artists Lastly but very importantly, the artists on streaming platforms are paid according to the number of streams their music generates. But since the majority of streaming platforms work on a revenue system known as a ‘shared pool,’ getting fake streams also translates into stealing from the pockets of other, more deserving artists. If fake **Spotify streams** are muddling the numbers, the money won’t be given to the small independent artists who deserve it.  Here are some other common and effective ways in which you can promote your music instead * Promoting your music on social media via TikToks, Reels and YouTube Shorts * Promoting your music with the help of Facebook ads * Pitching your songs to **Spotify editorial playlists**  *(during the time of release)* * Using Spotify For Artist' countless tools to promote your new releases * Pitch your music to **user-generated** playlists You might think that fake streams are very hard to trace, but that is not the case. Industry professionals can distinguish very easily between real and fraudulent **Spotify streams**. In the future, fake streams will just make it worse for you to get more exposure and growth. So when promoting music, choose what you do wisely and always go for the reliable and trustworthy option. Small mistakes can have long-term consequences, and there is no harm in being extra cautious.","the current era of music consumption is heavily dominated by streaming services like spotify and apple music. music distribution has become easier and very efficient, and almost every song is available to everyone across the globe. streaming is a process that, on paper, proves to be a win-win situation for everyone involved. the artist is paid more as their **spotify streams** increase, while the listener can listen to any song without going through the hassle of downloading it beforehand.  however, with the number of streams also acting as some sort of a status symbol, a lot of naive indie artists have been getting tempted to try it, and streaming fraud is becoming more and more commonplace in the industry. however, it can easily ruin the trajectory of an artist’s career.   what is streaming fraud?

qb775b,1634632375.0,mixingmastering,JoshFirefly,Dealing with emotions,"Hey, looking for some advice on how you deal with client feedback and resulting emotions.

Background is that I recently finished a mix that I put a lot of hours into to get it „perfect“ and radio ready (talking 30+ hours). I went beyond the norm, did a lot of production tasks too because some things were lacking and some things needed fixing. I did it because I truly enjoyed the song and felt it deserved the extra effort. The result is pretty good, I shared it with some mixing friends who liked it and also got a lot of very positive written feedback via submithub (first time trying that).

I then sent to the client (a band) and got some good feedback but also some that I perceived as non-constructive and negative (e.g. you manipulated my sound, it sounds like an 80s Bontempi, it sounds overproduced).

I am totally fine with the client not agreeing and wanting revisions, no sweat at all and I deliver the revisions with a smile and a “thank you for your feedback“. This is not my first mix and I have learned over time that often the clients do have good suggestions that work.

So my lesson learned is to in the future always ask the client if he is OK with alterations to the sound along the way.

But this instance did eat at me emotionally because I am convinced that the original version sounded significantly better than the revision.

q3rla1,1633672491.0,MusicPromotionTricks,iplaythelaptop,Find Spotify Playlist Curators: How to Get Placed on Spotify Playlists,"Playlists have become the easiest and most effective tool for new artists to get discovered, in the digital era of music. And yet the entire concept feels akin to witchcraft and wizardry for the uninitiated. 

That is fully understandable because playlists and **Spotify playlist curators** can be rather confusing. 

Here is everything you need to know about the different kinds of playlists and how you can end up on each of them. 

## Types of Spotify Playlists

It's important to go through the basics of the type of playlists that exist, before we jump onto the curation process.

**Spotify playlist curators** create a variety of playlists on the platform. The three most common types of playlists are Spotify Algorithmic Playlists, **Spotify Editorial Playlists**, and Listener’s Playlists.  
 

### 1. Spotify Algorithmic Playlists:

These playlists are created for the user specifically based on their listening habits. They are curated automatically for each Spotify user and are extremely personalized to their taste. Some common algorithmic playlists include 

* **Discover Weekly**, 30 new songs that are unheard of by the user 
* **Release Radar,** this playlist includes new songs released by artists that the listener already listens to
* **Daily Mix**, these are 6 playlists that include all the songs that a listener is familiar with 
* **On Repeat**, songs that you have been replaying in the last month
* **Repeat Rewind**, songs that you have had on repeat in the past

Getting your songs included in Algorithmic Playlists, can help your song reach listeners who will most certainly like it. These playlists have a high reach and are likely to make listeners loyal fans. However, you can’t pitch to someone to end up on these playlists as they’re created automatically.  
 

### 2. Spotify Editorial Playlists:

These are massively popular playlists that are made specifically by **Spotify Playlist curators**. These curators are in the editorial teams made by Spotify, and are music and genre experts. The playlists in this category can either be classified according to the genres or even made for certain specific situations. These playlists get a lot of followers and can help in highlighting smaller artists and make them massively popular. 

While creating **Spotify Editorial Playlist** playlists, **Spotify Playlist curators** usually try out songs by the smaller artists in smaller playlists first, and then if they gain traction, they are added to the playlists with a larger following. 

Getting your songs on these playlists can prove to be a huge advantage, and increase your streams by a great margin. To get your song added to these playlists, you can send your song for **Spotify Playlist Submission** a week or two before you release it to Spotify via your distributor. 

### 3. Listener Playlists:

These types of playlists are usually made by the listeners for their own use, but sometimes celebrities, influencers, brands, and companies can also make these and have extensive reach and followers. Some well-known companies that make their own playlists are: 

* [Systemic](https://open.spotify.com/user/oovgpqfyd2zjgkcm5ran58rog)
* [ChillTracks](https://open.spotify.com/user/khjj8khh7av6wbwtgspa3odyt)
* [LazyFrenzy](https://open.spotify.com/user/dbgkpwuxwg4q39w0ze1200ssz)

User-generated playlists can at times draw in huge numbers of followers and can produce a significant number of listeners and streams for an emerging artist. They also have the potential to influence Spotify’s algorithmic playlists: whenever a user adds your track to their playlist, it provides data to Spotify about the type of music they like. With enough data, Spotify can then recommend that track to other users who have similar listening habits, resulting in long-term audience growth.  


## Submitting Your Music In Spotify Playlists

Here's how you can help your songs get placed into playlists that are made by **Spotify Playlist Curators**.  


**1. Submit your song to Spotify** 

This is for Spotify's Editorial Playlists. Submit your songs to Spotify for consideration, at least a week before your release. A feature on Spotify's editorial playlists can really jumpstart a new musician's career. For a higher chance to be selected by **Spotify Playlist Curators** try to have a steady listener count and be specific about your music when you submit it. Make sure your metadata is filled in properly.  


**2. Pitch Your Music to Listener Playlists**

If you are a new musician, pitching your music to Listener **Spotify Playlist Curators** has a greater success rate as compared to pitching your music directly to Spotify. These curators usually charge a fee to listen to your music. Do note that no listener playlist will guarantee a playlist placement, since that is illegal. 

You might feel reserved about spending money just to get your music heard, and think that if you wait around you will get discovered, but pitching to curators is really one of the most efficient ways for new fans to stumble upon your music. These curators are also excited to meet new musicians, so reach out. 

Go for a reputable service like Submithub or StreamCatcher which is a boutique music submission service that brings together a plethora of curators for a lot of genres of music. You can submit your music for consideration for their playlists in exchange for a small fee.   


**3. Categorize your music**

Make sure you listen to a playlist before you pitch your music to it. When you are pitching your music, describe the genre, mood, type, and the works. This will increase the chances of your music being accepted. Don’t be afraid to paint a picture, like “Songs to listen to while driving” or “Songs for Rainy Days.”  


**4. Try to focus on your best song**

While submitting your song to get considered for playlists, submit your best song or the song that you think has the highest potential first. This song should be catchy and get the attention of the listener, ideally in the first few seconds of the song. If you only submit quality songs to a curator, the curator is likely to remember it. The converse is true as well.   


**5. Keep your pitch short**

The three most common types of playlists are Spotify Algorithmic Playlists, **Spotify Editorial Playlists**, and Listener’s Playlists.      1. Spotify Algorithmic Playlists These playlists are created for the user specifically based on their listening habits. They are curated automatically for each Spotify user and are extremely personalized to their taste. Some common algorithmic playlists include  * **Discover Weekly**, 30 new songs that are unheard of by the user  * **Release Radar,** this playlist includes new songs released by artists that the listener already listens to * **Daily Mix**, these are 6 playlists that include all the songs that a listener is familiar with  * **On Repeat**, songs that you have been replaying in the last month * **Repeat Rewind**, songs that you have had on repeat in the past Getting your songs included in Algorithmic Playlists, can help your song reach listeners who will most certainly like it.

They also have the potential to influence Spotify’s algorithmic playlists whenever a user adds your track to their playlist, it provides data to Spotify about the type of music they like. With enough data, Spotify can then recommend that track to other users who have similar listening habits, resulting in long-term audience growth.    Submitting Your Music In Spotify Playlists Here's how you can help your songs get placed into playlists that are made by **Spotify Playlist Curators**.   **1. Submit your song to Spotify**  This is for Spotify's Editorial Playlists. Submit your songs to Spotify for consideration, at least a week before your release.

These curators are also excited to meet new musicians, so reach out.  Go for a reputable service like Submithub or StreamCatcher which is a boutique music submission service that brings together a plethora of curators for a lot of genres of music. You can submit your music for consideration for their playlists in exchange for a small fee.    **3. Categorize your music** Make sure you listen to a playlist before you pitch your music to it. When you are pitching your music, describe the genre, mood, type, and the works. This will increase the chances of your music being accepted. Don’t be afraid to paint a picture, like “Songs to listen to while driving” or “Songs for Rainy Days.”   **4. Try to focus on your best song** While submitting your song to get considered for playlists, submit your best song or the song that you think has the highest potential first. This song should be catchy and get the attention of the listener, ideally in the first few seconds of the song. If you only submit quality songs to a curator, the curator is likely to remember it. The converse is true as well.    **5. Keep your pitch short** When you are sending your song to playlist curators, keep your pitch short and sweet.

A feature on Spotify's editorial playlists can really jumpstart a new musician's career. For a higher chance to be selected by **Spotify Playlist Curators** try to have a steady listener count and be specific about your music when you submit it. Make sure your metadata is filled in properly.  


**2. Pitch Your Music to Listener Playlists**

If you are a new musician, pitching your music to Listener **Spotify Playlist Curators** has a greater success rate as compared to pitching your music directly to Spotify. These curators usually charge a fee to listen to your music. Do note that no listener playlist will guarantee a playlist placement, since that is illegal. 

You might feel reserved about spending money just to get your music heard, and think that if you wait around you will get discovered, but pitching to curators is really one of the most efficient ways for new fans to stumble upon your music. These curators are also excited to meet new musicians, so reach out. 

Go for a reputable service like Submithub or StreamCatcher which is a boutique music submission service that brings together a plethora of curators for a lot of genres of music. You can submit your music for consideration for their playlists in exchange for a small fee.   


**3. Categorize your music**

Make sure you listen to a playlist before you pitch your music to it. When you are pitching your music, describe the genre, mood, type, and the works. This will increase the chances of your music being accepted. Don’t be afraid to paint a picture, like “Songs to listen to while driving” or “Songs for Rainy Days.”  


**4. Try to focus on your best song**

While submitting your song to get considered for playlists, submit your best song or the song that you think has the highest potential first. This song should be catchy and get the attention of the listener, ideally in the first few seconds of the song. If you only submit quality songs to a curator, the curator is likely to remember it. The converse is true as well.   


**5. Keep your pitch short**

When you are sending your song to playlist curators, keep your pitch short and sweet. Do your research about the playlists and make sure that your song will fit on the playlist. Tell them why you think it will be a perfect addition to their playlist. Be polite and brief, and never act entitled.

And yet the entire concept feels akin to witchcraft and wizardry for the uninitiated.  That is fully understandable because playlists and **Spotify playlist curators** can be rather confusing.  Here is everything you need to know about the different kinds of playlists and how you can end up on each of them.   Types of Spotify Playlists It's important to go through the basics of the type of playlists that exist, before we jump onto the curation process. **Spotify playlist curators** create a variety of playlists on the platform. The three most common types of playlists are Spotify Algorithmic Playlists, **Spotify Editorial Playlists**, and Listener’s Playlists.      1. Spotify Algorithmic Playlists These playlists are created for the user specifically based on their listening habits. They are curated automatically for each Spotify user and are extremely personalized to their taste. Some common algorithmic playlists include  * **Discover Weekly**, 30 new songs that are unheard of by the user  * **Release Radar,** this playlist includes new songs released by artists that the listener already listens to * **Daily Mix**, these are 6 playlists that include all the songs that a listener is familiar with  * **On Repeat**, songs that you have been replaying in the last month * **Repeat Rewind**, songs that you have had on repeat in the past Getting your songs included in Algorithmic Playlists, can help your song reach listeners who will most certainly like it. These playlists have a high reach and are likely to make listeners loyal fans. However, you can’t pitch to someone to end up on these playlists as they’re created automatically.      2. Spotify Editorial Playlists These are massively popular playlists that are made specifically by **Spotify Playlist curators**. These curators are in the editorial teams made by Spotify, and are music and genre experts. The playlists in this category can either be classified according to the genres or even made for certain specific situations. These playlists get a lot of followers and can help in highlighting smaller artists and make them massively popular.  While creating **Spotify Editorial Playlist** playlists, **Spotify Playlist curators** usually try out songs by the smaller artists in smaller playlists first, and then if they gain traction, they are added to the playlists with a larger following.  Getting your songs on these playlists can prove to be a huge advantage, and increase your streams by a great margin. To get your song added to these playlists, you can send your song for **Spotify Playlist Submission** a week or two before you release it to Spotify via your distributor.   3. Listener Playlists These types of playlists are usually made by the listeners for their own use, but sometimes celebrities, influencers, brands, and companies can also make these and have extensive reach and followers. Some well-known companies that make their own playlists are  * Systemic( * ChillTracks( * LazyFrenzy( User-generated playlists can at times draw in huge numbers of followers and can produce a significant number of listeners and streams for an emerging artist. They also have the potential to influence Spotify’s algorithmic playlists whenever a user adds your track to their playlist, it provides data to Spotify about the type of music they like. With enough data, Spotify can then recommend that track to other users who have similar listening habits, resulting in long-term audience growth.

I soon learned that focusing on Soundcloud for marketing was a pointless exercise, since the majority of the small following I have there are just other producers. What Soundcloud did give me, is contact with another producer that agreed to collaborate with me. Back in June I sent him my third track that was almost finished.

He happened to be friends with the owner of a record label in Hamburg, probably the biggest label know for progressive psy-trance, so we released the track with them. My Spotify monthly listeners increased 954%, to 9,000 monthly listeners from that one track alone. This is the power of a label, since they got the track on some big playlists.

While am I a new producer, I have worked with the audio engineering side of things since the 1990s, so I know I have my mixes on-point. I also do mastering, but with this track we had the label do the mastering. However, this is just a hobby for me. I love being creative and producing.

**Lesson 1:** Collaboration. The other producer didn't have to change much about the track. Some effects and a new kick / bass line was added (from a sample pack!) and that's it. The entire composition, arrangement, vocals, synths, and other bits were my original work. From his perspective I am benefiting from his 30k+ social media following and contact at the label.  He told me that this label gives preference to collaborating artists, as it pools together their social media following, and lowers risk. If either of us wanted to do it solo, they wouldn't be interested unless you have a huge following in the first place, and can pull crowds at gigs. Getting signed with a label, and releasing a track or two are completely different things.

**Lesson 2:** Social media. I am not on Facebook, and I don't want to be. I have a new Twitter and Instagram account (&lt; 100 followers), a website, and obviously Soundcloud, and Spotify.  Without a large social media following, I can release a track myself with Distrokid or similar, but nobody will know about it. I can't use ads, since I don't have a Facebook account.  Google ads are a waste of money.  What I have found out from my one popular release, is that 70% of listeners are coming from playlists. 

**Lesson 3**: Playlists. As I eluded, playlists are king especially for niche genre's. Sure if you produce rap, pop, rock, something like that then Spotify's Feel Good Friday, Release Radar, and other playlists are essential. Labels will often have their own, and contacts at massive playlists. Without the power of a label then I will have to rely of something like SubmitHub.

**Lesson 4:** Mainstream tastes. I have just finished my latest track, and it's way better than anything else I've done, including the label release. But they don't want it (unless it's a collab). Other labels I have sent it to haven't even listened to it (Soundcloud stats are useful!). One other label did say this has potential to be a top-tier track, but they'd want 50% royalties, they do the artwork, and they want to add more effects, synth sounds, etc. But here is the thing, I know exactly what they are getting it, but then it'll become the same as the rest of the music out there. It's cheesy. So I could give in, do what they ask, despite it getting ruined (from my original sound)... or release myself again. If I do it myself, I do the artwork, choose who masters it, and have full say over the creative aspects.

So what is next for me?

By day I work in cybersecurity, and get paid well for it. So I am not going to be traveling (post COVID) to gigs doing DJ sets, even as cool as it sounds, this is just a hobby. The question is, I know I can continue to do better and better, but it's getting to the point where I either buckle and change the track to 'conform' to what labels want, or I collaborate and allow others to stamp their mark so I can use their massive social media following. Or... I just release myself and be lucky if 100 people hear it.

I haven't fully decided yet, but I am leaning towards SubmitHub and focusing on playlists again.

pgzgvb,1630649786.0,MusicPromotion,iplaythelaptop,Different Types of Spotify Playlists &amp; How They Can Help You Grow,"Today, a huge part of being successful as an indie artist is getting their music onto well-known playlists. **Spotify** is arguably the biggest in the business when it comes to these playlists. In this blog, we’re going to dig deeper into the kinds of **Spotify playlists** and what role and purpose each of them plays in **music marketing** and helping an artist’s audience grow.

Majorly, there are 3 **types of Spotify Playlists**: Spotify Algorithmic Playlists, Spotify Editorial Playlists, and Listener Playlists. Let’s dive in.

## 1. Spotify Algorithmic Playlists

**Spotify Algorithmic Playlists** are those Spotify playlists that are created automatically for each user on Spotify. This is done by monitoring each user’s listening habits and analyzing this information to curate these super personalized playlists. Here are a few important algorithmic playlists:

## Discover Weekly

Discover Weekly is a weekly updated algorithmic playlist which is personalized and unique for every user of Spotify. Each Monday, this playlist offers 30 songs to each Spotify user that they’ve never heard before. The songs in this playlist can be anything ranging from unheard songs from an artist you enjoy to music from artists similar to the ones you enjoy.

## Release Radar

Release Radar is a bit more straightforward. Each Friday, this playlist curates new releases from the artists that you listen to and enjoy. 

## Daily Mix

The Daily Mix is a set of up to 6 playlists that Spotify curates, designed to provide comfortable and familiar music. It is inspired by your favourite music according to your Spotify activity. It is different from the Discover Weekly playlist because the Daily Mix emphasizes more on familiarity and less on discovery. 

## On Repeat

 The On Repeat playlist only contains the tracks that you’ve been playing the most over the past month. This playlist keeps auto-updating itself.

## Repeat Rewind

Repeat Rewind, on the other hand, is a way to reminisce about your favorite songs from the near past by including the songs that you used to have on repeat from over a month ago. 

## How These Playlists Can Help Grow Your Audience on Spotify:

Spotify algorithmic playlists have an insanely high reach. These are highly targeted towards listeners who are almost certain to love your music. This can bring about a shockingly huge number of streams, especially for talented artists in less popular genres. Spotify users that regularly listen to playlists like Discover Weekly and Release Radar are generally likely to be “active” listeners, who actively search for new music. These listeners, while fewer in number, are much more likely to turn into loyal fans.

## 2. Spotify Editorial Playlists

Spotify has a Shows &amp; Editorial Team which curates the Spotify Editorial playlists for them. This team has music experts and genre specialists from around the world, specially hired by Spotify to curate playlists. 

These playlists typically have large followings and a lot of indie artists have these playlists to thank for suddenly skyrocketing their discovery. Many of these playlists are genre-specific – think “RapCaviar”, “Hot Country”, or “Rock This”. Others are more context-driven, such as “Songs to Sing in the Shower”, “Teen Party”, or “Relax &amp; Unwind”.

The Editorial Team of Spotify will often test out new tracks on smaller “feeder” playlists. For example, tracks that perform well on a playlist like “New Noise” (289K followers) might be promoted to “Rock This” (4.3M followers); songs that gain traction on a playlist such as “Most Necessary” (1.8M followers) might eventually end up on “Rap Caviar” (10.3M followers).

## How This Playlist Type Can Help Grow Your Audience on Spotify

Spotify Editorial Playlists enjoy the undeniable advantage, as far as number of followers is concerned. Most musicians are justifiably keen on getting a spot on these playlists, and for good reason: a placement on a major playlist like ""Your Favorite Coffeehouse"" or ""Peaceful Piano"" can translate into countless new audiences and streams. However, a big chunk of these streams can be ""drive-by"" streams. These listeners can often be more passive about their music listening habits; they’re less likely to turn into active, long-term fans. Note that Spotify for Artists allows you to submit your upcoming releases to Spotify’s editorial team, about 1-2 weeks before your release date. Make sure to do so!

## 3. Listener Playlists

User-generated playlists or listener playlists are those that are made and maintained by Spotify users themselves. These users can decide whether to make their playlists ""secret"" or ""public"". While many Spotify users curate playlists for their own enjoyment, numerous organizations, companies, celebrities etc. curate their own playlists, typically as an approach to expand their brand.

Let’s take a few examples.

* [Stream Catcher](https://www.streamcatcher.co/)

This is a group of expert curators that work with an ever growing network of Spotify curators and Youtube networks. The Stream Catcher A&amp;R team spends close to an hour listening and evaluating every song which comes through, to help artists broaden their horizons and reach a wider and more global audience. 

* [SubmitHub](https://www.submithub.com/)

Created by Jason Grishkoff (founder of the very popular blog IndieShuffle), on SubmitHub, you can pay bloggers, playlisters, radio programmers, Soundclouders and YouTubers to listen to your song for possible inclusion on their (hopefully) high-trafficked site/playlist/channel. 

## How This Playlist Type Can Help Grow Your Audience on Spotify

User-generated playlists can at times draw in huge numbers of followers and can produce a significant number of listeners and streams for an emerging artist. They also have the potential to influence Spotify’s algorithmic playlists: whenever a user adds your track to their playlist, it provides data to Spotify about the type of music they like. With enough data, Spotify can then recommend that track to other users who have similar listening habits, resulting in long-term audience growth.

Getting on playlists is surely a great step that can help you get discovered, especially as a new artist.

This is done by monitoring each user’s listening habits and analyzing this information to curate these super personalized playlists. Here are a few important algorithmic playlists:

## Discover Weekly

Discover Weekly is a weekly updated algorithmic playlist which is personalized and unique for every user of Spotify. Each Monday, this playlist offers 30 songs to each Spotify user that they’ve never heard before. The songs in this playlist can be anything ranging from unheard songs from an artist you enjoy to music from artists similar to the ones you enjoy.

## Release Radar

Release Radar is a bit more straightforward. Each Friday, this playlist curates new releases from the artists that you listen to and enjoy. 

## Daily Mix

The Daily Mix is a set of up to 6 playlists that Spotify curates, designed to provide comfortable and familiar music. It is inspired by your favourite music according to your Spotify activity. It is different from the Discover Weekly playlist because the Daily Mix emphasizes more on familiarity and less on discovery. 

## On Repeat

 The On Repeat playlist only contains the tracks that you’ve been playing the most over the past month. This playlist keeps auto-updating itself.

## Repeat Rewind

Repeat Rewind, on the other hand, is a way to reminisce about your favorite songs from the near past by including the songs that you used to have on repeat from over a month ago. 

## How These Playlists Can Help Grow Your Audience on Spotify:

Spotify algorithmic playlists have an insanely high reach. These are highly targeted towards listeners who are almost certain to love your music. This can bring about a shockingly huge number of streams, especially for talented artists in less popular genres. Spotify users that regularly listen to playlists like Discover Weekly and Release Radar are generally likely to be “active” listeners, who actively search for new music. These listeners, while fewer in number, are much more likely to turn into loyal fans.

## 2. Spotify Editorial Playlists

Spotify has a Shows &amp; Editorial Team which curates the Spotify Editorial playlists for them. This team has music experts and genre specialists from around the world, specially hired by Spotify to curate playlists. 

These playlists typically have large followings and a lot of indie artists have these playlists to thank for suddenly skyrocketing their discovery. Many of these playlists are genre-specific – think “RapCaviar”, “Hot Country”, or “Rock This”. Others are more context-driven, such as “Songs to Sing in the Shower”, “Teen Party”, or “Relax &amp; Unwind”.

The Editorial Team of Spotify will often test out new tracks on smaller “feeder” playlists. For example, tracks that perform well on a playlist like “New Noise” (289K followers) might be promoted to “Rock This” (4.3M followers); songs that gain traction on a playlist such as “Most Necessary” (1.8M followers) might eventually end up on “Rap Caviar” (10.3M followers).

## How This Playlist Type Can Help Grow Your Audience on Spotify

Spotify Editorial Playlists enjoy the undeniable advantage, as far as number of followers is concerned. Most musicians are justifiably keen on getting a spot on these playlists, and for good reason: a placement on a major playlist like ""Your Favorite Coffeehouse"" or ""Peaceful Piano"" can translate into countless new audiences and streams. However, a big chunk of these streams can be ""drive-by"" streams. These listeners can often be more passive about their music listening habits; they’re less likely to turn into active, long-term fans. Note that Spotify for Artists allows you to submit your upcoming releases to Spotify’s editorial team, about 1-2 weeks before your release date. Make sure to do so!

## 3. Listener Playlists

User-generated playlists or listener playlists are those that are made and maintained by Spotify users themselves. These users can decide whether to make their playlists ""secret"" or ""public"". While many Spotify users curate playlists for their own enjoyment, numerous organizations, companies, celebrities etc. curate their own playlists, typically as an approach to expand their brand.

Let’s take a few examples.

* [Stream Catcher](https://www.streamcatcher.co/)

This is a group of expert curators that work with an ever growing network of Spotify curators and Youtube networks. The Stream Catcher A&amp;R team spends close to an hour listening and evaluating every song which comes through, to help artists broaden their horizons and reach a wider and more global audience. 

* [SubmitHub](https://www.submithub.com/)

Created by Jason Grishkoff (founder of the very popular blog IndieShuffle), on SubmitHub, you can pay bloggers, playlisters, radio programmers, Soundclouders and YouTubers to listen to your song for possible inclusion on their (hopefully) high-trafficked site/playlist/channel. 

## How This Playlist Type Can Help Grow Your Audience on Spotify

User-generated playlists can at times draw in huge numbers of followers and can produce a significant number of listeners and streams for an emerging artist. They also have the potential to influence Spotify’s algorithmic playlists: whenever a user adds your track to their playlist, it provides data to Spotify about the type of music they like. With enough data, Spotify can then recommend that track to other users who have similar listening habits, resulting in long-term audience growth.

Getting on playlists is surely a great step that can help you get discovered, especially as a new artist.

p7klo2,1629397650.0,musicmarketing,Fabulous_Employ,Submithub/Bot Playlist Question,"Hey everyone! I am a part of a four piece band that recently dropped our EP last week. We are on Spotify, Bandcamp, Soundcloud, and Apple/Itunes. We were looking to get some feedback and possibly get on a playlist or a blog. We submitted two songs to Submithub and made it on a few playlists, have okay ratings on the Hot or Not feature, and have sent it to about 30 blogs over four days time, and just made it on to one.

We all have Spotify for artists on our phones and were checking our streaming numbers. Some time Tuesday night, IT BLEW up. Like, thousands of streams between late Tuesday night and yesterday. We all messaged each other like ""WTF?"". Today, it is still showing anywhere between 20-60 people listening at a time and we are up to over 8k streams, and climbing. We are all sort of freaking out because they only ""marketing"" we have done has been TikTok ads and submitting through Submithub. I have been Googling like crazy trying to figure out what would cause a spike like this. The only thing I could come across was being added to a bot-controlled playlist OR pay for plays. None of us have done the latter, but I am wondering if it is possible that either:

1. We were added to a bot playlist and that the plays are completely artificial.
2. Someone added us to a bot play program without our knowledge. We had a few real stinker reviews and some not so nice comments, so I am wondering if someone could try and fuck with us by adding our links to a pay for play site? We also had one artist who we chatted with. He sent us a song which was not great, we did not reply and he seemed to be pissed off. I looked it up and it looks like all you need is the link to the music, and with our band name and Spotify links posted, I would assume it would not be hard. Also, shortly after this, our band IG was hacked (we were able to save it) and one of our players had their IG hacked and completely wiped off the face of the planet. Coincidence, maybe? Just seems REALLY weird.
3. Far less likely option, they are real plays and we somehow won some sort of cosmic jackpot sending everyone to us. I don't find that likely though, as we have only submitted two of our four songs to Submithub....and only those two songs are blowing up.

We are terrified of being suspended or banned from Spotify. Don't care at all about the monetary aspect, we just want to get our music out there, but NOT like this. I am saying we email Spotify customer service to see what our options are, but others are saying don't and let it ride. I am totally panicked. Any thoughts on what this could be? Any thoughts on letting it ride vs. preemptively reaching out to Spotify vs. some way through Distrokid to mute/pause distribution on a song?

TIA. Any help is appreciated.

Sincerely,Very Freaked Out

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: Stopped for a good part of yesterday and then picked back up, getting to over 9k in streams. Then... it stopped. THEN... the streams reset back down to 3k and have stayed there. We are out of the first 7 days so results are no longer ""live"", so I can't tell if it is still happening or not. I am thinking they saw the streams and removed them. The songs are still up and still playable, so I am unsure of what is next or if removing them/banning us is still on the table. We did not receive any sort of email or warning, so I am just waiting for some sort of news as to what is next.

p20y11,1628637987.0,musicmarketing,PotemkinCityLimits,How to market your music for free,"Since we're mostly all broke musicians here, I thought it'd be helpful to start a discussion on free ways to promote your music. These are some things that have helped me, but it's certainly not an exhaustive list, feel free to comment your own ideas as well.

1. Social media. This is probably the most obvious one, but what I've noticed is that sometimes it's actually better to promote on the lesser known ones. Obviously Facebook, Instagram and TikTok can all be good tools, but I've also been having a lot of success on platforms like Amino, Socialmob, Likee and Bigo. Use hashtags relevant to your genre and use a mix of popular and lesser known hashtags.

The benefit of these smaller platforms is that they're not oversatured with musicians trying to promote themselves so they have a more engaged community that's more likely to actually listen to your music rather than just scroll past. Here's a list of [250 lesser known social media apps](https://socialmedialist.org/social-media-apps.html) to get you started

2) Submitting to Spotify playlists. I use [Soundplate](https://soundplate.com/), [Daily Playlists](https://dailyplaylists.com/), [Submithub](https://www.submithub.com/), [Indiemono](https://indiemono.com/), [Boost Collective](https://boostcollective.ca/), [Listn](https://listn.live/submission/) and [United Sound Source](https://unitedsoundsource.com/free-spotify-playlist-submission/). They're all either free or have a free option.

3) Posting on Reddit. There's the obvious choices of posting in the [major music subreddits](https://www.edmsauce.com/2018/01/29/music-subreddits/), but a lot of people don't think about the fact that songs can do well in non-music related subreddits as long as it's relevant. For example, a comedy rap could do well in [r/funny](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/) or a song about a social issue could do well in a sub that shares those beliefs.

4) Submitting to music blogs. This one is going to be the most tedious, but this [list of the best music blogs to submit to](https://midination.com/blog/blogs-submit-music/) is a good place to start. Also look for blogs specific to your genre. [Create an electronic press kit](https://bandzoogle.com/blog/title-how-to-easily-build-an-epk-using-bandzoogle-s-preset-page-templates) to attach to your email.

5) Ask all your family and friends to like the song, add it to their playlists and comment on your posts. Any type of engagement you can get on it will help boost it in the algorithm and push it out to more people.

6) Support other artists and provide real value. You can use sites like [RepostExchange](https://repostexchange.com/) to get your songs reposted on Soundcloud in exchange for giving reposts to other artists. Find a community of people who support each others grind and stay away from people that treat music like a competition where they can only win if you lose.

If you want to mutually support each other's music, post your links in the comments and I'll follow, like, subscribe etc. If you want to return the favour, you can find all my links [here.](https://www.senseoffence.com/)",55,0.97,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicmarketing/comments/p20y11/how_to_market_your_music_for_free/,How to market your music for free,how to market your music for free,"Since we're mostly all broke musicians here, I thought it'd be helpful to start a discussion on free ways to promote your music.

I love making music and although I know my weakspots, I really think I am decent in my songwriting and technical skills. Ive been doing it for almost a decade now.

I’m a 100k page and have posted maybe 6-8 songs and just cashed out $103 within two weeks. 
It’s pretty good as you get to choose what songs you want to post and you also get paid $0.25 for the time spent listening to a song and rejecting it.
I don’t posts songs too often so I’m aiming for maybe $300 a month from just submit hub alone.
Also adding the songs hasn’t effected my engagement what so ever. Although if I do add a song it won’t get viral but it will still get thousands of likes.

Overall I would say to sign up for Submit hub if you have an active theme page, probably at least 10k followers though.

nzl4zr,1623671859.0,MusicPromotion,staanslav,Avoid PlaylistPush at all costs.,"In my 5/6 years career, I have never come across such a joke in this industry.

For those who don't know, PlaylistPush markets itself as the **ultimate tool for playlist submission**.  Having hundreds if not a thousand of curators, they assure you that  your song will be sent to the right pair of ears - something that was  too pretty to be true.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*""We send your music to a targeted group of playlist curators, they review your song for playlist consideration""*

and

&gt;*""We have the most active network of Spotify curators and measure data from each campaign for maximum effectiveness""*

are  both quotes taken from the home page of the website - doesn't it sound  like the best way to reach new fans by using their highly advanced  service?

&amp;#x200B;

This is how you usually submit a song:

1. the song has to be approved by PlaylistPush moderators before being able to set up a campaign
2. once  approved, you can set up your campaign by choosing your budget (minimum  $300), and by specifying the multiple genres of your song - **""pop, alt pop, electronic pop"" were mine**
3. next,  you only have to pay them and schedule your campaign. The song will  then be sent to a certain number of curators in the genres you specified  and they will have 14 days to either add you to their playlist or  simply tell you why they wouldn't - the more you pay, the more curators  you will reach ;)

&amp;#x200B;

I personally paid $300 for my campaign, which is equivalent to 44 curators reached according to the website.

My results after 5 days out of 14: 1 playlist add out of 8

not  so bad would you say? The only playlist that added me, not only had 3K  likes but is also almost inactive due to the non existent traffic I got  off it.

Now, time for the reviews  of the playlists that did not accept me. I would like to remind you that  the genres I specified were pop, alt pop and electronic pop - **lots of pop, if not only pop**.

So  far, I feel like I have been abused by the PlaylistPush service - not  only their reviews are similar to the ones you get on SubmitHub (another  great tool for musicians am I right ;) ) but you also **pay ten times more for them to write you that!!!!!!!!**

They are LITERALLY a scam, nothing more.

And  if my song was so trash, why did the PlaylistPush staff even accept it?  Sent me multiple reminder emails that my ""campaign is waiting"" and  offered me a discount code?

nk55k9,1621882083.0,musicmarketing,splitshifts,Music Marketing Starts During Production Phase!,"Hey guys, just wanted to share some tips that I have applied and so far has worked for me whenever I release music. Note: This post doesn’t guarantee a blast of millions of streams for your music release but with consistency you can see the numbers improve over time - some times even years! But let’s be positive and hear me out what you can start off with:

Production Phase:

- Planning the vibe and topic of your song is key. It’ll lead you down to streamlined content creation. It could be about your sexuality, your hardknock life etc.
- Once you got the concept of the song, try thinking of ways to sonically story tell your tracks. You may want to use samples of familiar sounds or others that represent your story. Example, you could use sound bites from your microwave if you’re writing about the food you can only eat out of poverty. Or maybe you could use a sample of the sound of waves to represent what a utopian state is to you. Depends on what you write about, be creative on the sound selection!
- Document every step you took to compose the music. It could be short form or long form videos. You could even do a mini documentary on how the sounds you created and used meant so much to your work and your song.

Once The Mix &amp; Mastering Is Done:

- Give yourself at least 6 weeks before the release. This gives you ample time to plan and execute your social media marketing plans for your music.

Week 6:

- Check your masters and if they are good to go, start uploading onto your distro platforms like Ditto Music and Distro Kid. This will ensure that your release will be on time for the date that has been scheduled to be on all digital streaming platforms.
- Start writing out your press release for the song. The sooner you get on it, the more in depth and meaningful your press release can be. Try to find an angle to the song i.e. the vibe and concept of the song that is news worthy for bloggers to feature.

Week 5:

- Get your press releases vetted by someone who’s good at copyrighting. Or you can get a friend or someone you know to give a third person perspective. Get their common comments that can help improve the press release.
- Engage a photographer to take photos of you for your press kit and another session to angle for your story or concept of the song. Or you can DIY on your own as we know smartphones nowadays are really handy as the camera specs are really good such as the iPhone.
- Prepare a single release banner design to be consistent on all your social platforms. This is to promote brand awareness in Week 4.

Week 4:

- Prepare a press kit for yourself as an artist. Be sure to include photos, bio and your social links within so that bloggers and media are one click away from getting to know you better.
- Get your pre-save links ready from your distro sites to promote a pre save campaign for your song. Be sure to think of a valuable asset to offer your potential listeners in exchange for a presaved link. Be creative! Could be free merch or even sample packs depending on the demand of your audience!
- Update all of your banner on social media to include the release date of your single and the pre-save link.
- Research on relevant blogs that you might think may feature your song. Try searching for blogs that support artists that you sound like or look up to.

Week 3:
- Start posting your short form and long form videos on your socials - video content is key and showing your process and how it influences your single drives credibility and genuinity to your artist self.
- Spread out the video content to weeks 2 &amp; 1 leading up to the release.
- On your socials, this is the best chance to engage with your followers and boost the algorithm to generate more views.
- Set up a brand awareness post on your new single via facebook or instagram ads and drive traffic to your presave links.

Week 2:

- Send out your press release to blogs and spotify playlisters together with your presskit. Be sure to keep the subject header to the angle of your press and stating your new release information - title and release date.
- Send out the song SubmitHub curators. This is where you spend a good 50 bucks for chance to be on good blogs and playlists too.
- Don’t forget your short form and long form videos with the presave link promoted in the post description.

Week 1:

- Do a countdown post to your song.
- Give a pre-thank you post for those who presaved your song.
- Do not stop sending your press releases and continue researching for more medias to submit to. Blog and media promotion usually occur after release day.
- Do a summary video of your long and short form video to reinforce your song’s concept to interested and potential listeners. Listeners like to experience your journey as an artist putting out that special single.

Week 0 and weeks after release:

- Release day!!!!
- Share out interviews and media features.
- Share out seeded playlists.
- Share behind the scenes video.
- Share music video or music visualizer videos.
- Any other content that promotes the growth of your single since release day.

niri4e,1621715786.0,musicmarketing,abdallahharati,"My workflow to release albums, songs and EPs","Hey all!

I've been releasing several singles and EP in the last 11 months. In total 12 singles and one EP. I've written down my own workflow for the releases and thought it would good to share with all of you. This far to be perfect, but at least a start and happy to hear thoughts, comments, suggestions so we can all learn.

Prior to the release:

1. prior to the release, count down posts in Instagram (I'm trying to focus my social media in Instagram)
2. Spotify editorial playlist pitch

Release Day:

1. add song to all my artists playlists (I maintain a playlist with all my songs and another one with several other alike artists)
2. link creation via Odesli
3. update my own micro site with the link (equivalent to Linktree, but I do it on my own website with the WordPress plugin Social Links)
4. update on my website, launching the music, with few lines about the single/EP and Odesli link
5. update on the quick link on my website, so links for the song are always visible
6. MailChimp email campaign to all my contacts
7. Instragram: Story, Reels and Post with the release. Sometimes I do use 3 or 9 images's grid
8. Facebook goes in sync with Instagram. Once I post there, I will share on my personal profile and share in few music groups I'm part of.
9. WhatsApp Stories and posts to few music related groups.
10. Snapshat story update (I do it because it is easy, but I don't have traction there)
11. TikTok quick video. Same as Snapshat, I don't have too many people there.
12. Twitter post
13. As I publish songs with Amuse, I always pitch to their staff picks playlist.
14. I have a list of blogs for pitching, but very limited traction and results so far.
15. SubmitHub - I always put the song there, particularly for the Hot / Not. I network a lot via this Hot/Not tool, which I get more results than the normal/premium submissions.

After the release day: I'm still building my workflow... lots of studies on going.

Other points I am missing: video production for the releases, benefit more from YouTube for the release day,

Adding my results so far my results so far:

\- my audience in Spotify has been around 4k listeners per month.

\- I'm reaching around \~220 streams per day (in all these process I've managed to get one song in Spotify Editorial Playlist, but I have no idea what special I have done to be there)

\- currently 168 followers in Spotify

\- In Apple Music I've reaching in total 1900 plays, few purchases and few Shazams

\- Deezer not significant. Amazon Music very little. YT Music a bit. Tidal I have no idea.

I forgot to say that I'm playing with Facebook/Instagram adds, but cannot share conclusions yet.

ng3j4o,1621424549.0,TechnoProduction,Dr_eyebrow,New producers: beware of scammers,"Our scene is full of amazing labels and compared to more commercial scenes many labels are relatively open to newcomers. The downside is that scammers make good use of this by setting up fake labels and charging artists to release on it.

This might sounds stupid, but it's easy to fall for when you start out and have no idea of how labels work. Especially when these fake labels have been able to trap people that later have become big in the scene, or when they are just impersonating famous producers.

Two golden rules:

1. NEVER pay a label

Releases / Digital Content

\---------------------------------------------------

* Release singles every 2 weeks starting this Wednesday, I currently have 3 songs finished on my burners, which gives me a few weeks of wiggle room.
* Submit each song to Spotify Editorial playlists 2 weeks in advance, along with user curated playlists via Submithub (can't do editorial for this first release, but following ones should be good)
* Following drops, create content for insta / tiktok relating to the songs
   * ""if u like \_\_\_\_\_, u might like my song \_\_\_\_\_"" tiktoks
   * take prominent lyric from the song and re appropriate it to a reaction tiktok format
   * maybe reach out to dance / fashion tiktokers and see if they'd like to use my song?
   * piano / guitar tutorial videos for the songs
   * drum packs promos (share the song with 5 people, and I'll email u a pack of my drums) for producers
* Idk what to do with youtube right now, hopefully once I have the cash to pay a band and play some shows at the end of the summer I can do some filmed Tiny Desk-esque performances, my girlfriend can help me film a music video (she's a videographer with good gear). I can use VidIQ, TubeBuddy, and Morning Frame to make sure my tagging is effective. 
* Leading up to drops, posting a photo shoot, a teaser audio 2 days before, and getting my friends to share the teaser and the drop

Live performances

\------------------------------------------------

* Get my 1hr set together this summer, I'm currently at 25 minutes...
* Develop an emergency savings of around $600 in case a gig payment falls through and I need to pay musicians out of pocket
   * I think paying my musicians is an important thing. In my experience with previous groups, I run into professionalism issues with unpaid musicians, along with flakes. If a musician is getting paid, I get my pick of better players from the Jazz department, more effort from their part (nobody is going to forget the chords, but I'll make charts for the tunes anyways...) and its highly unlikely I'll get a flake.
* Reach out to fraternities and party houses on my campus, ask if they'd like to host a show together. I would handle booking (my band, plus one opener band, and a closing DJ) and take a cut of door, they would handle and pocket drink sales?
   * I feel worried about this bit. I ran a successful DIY venue for awhile, and we'd regularly pull $1000 on a night, but I no longer have my house. I feel worried about relying on others to host parties / shows, along with trying to break even...
* Reach out to bars and see if I can get gigs? If I'm running with a band, I'd need to pull \~$300 to pay everybody per gig. I don't need to profit anything myself, but I don't think I can afford to eat that bill each time I play a show.  Following [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/2igigm/im_an_artist_manager_who_specializes_in_helping/cl21tzm) guide for reaching out.
* I could gig with just me and a DJ, although its not the performance that I envision, I could do this for a lot cheaper. \~$75 / gig, which I can totally get through some of the DIY venue connects I currently have. I feel like my listener retention would be lower though. I want people's brains to be melted when they leave my show.
* I want to gig like a motherfucker. I'm hoping around July, I'll have a good number of tunes out with some listeners and I'll be able to convince either independents to let me use their space, or venues to book me (the quality of my work is very high, but I don't have an established base. My old band I used to front was getting around 15k streams on our songs...)
   * Literally any advise relating to this is greatly appreciated. I feel like my current approach to getting gigs is a bit of a stretch.

Essentially, I have an extra semester finishing up some physics labs at University. I want to milk *everything* I can get out of being on a college campus before moving out into the real world.

I know this strategy usually takes more time to develop. But, I’ve had above average success on sites like SubmitHub. My approval rate is around 30%. My recent single, it’s been 1 week, got 17 playlist approvals, a lot of them have over 2-3,000 likes and one of them even has 200,000 likes (idk if that is a fake bot playlist) but anyway, my single is sitting at 577 streams after 1 week. I spent $100 in submission fees. For my genre of (funk, lofi, study, jazz guitar beats) and I’ve pretty much submitted to everyone in those categories.

Regardless of how strong the song actually is, i think I’ve gone above and beyond the average SubmitHub submission rate and the amount of playlists that have accepted me. 

My first single I released 5 months ago, also with this method has a little over 3,000 streams, which is great. But if this is the best model I can do...I think this system is pretty much tapped and over.

This isn’t a complaint thread, but more of a beware for new artists of this path. Just submitting music to playlists, sounds like the right thing to do, breaking the &lt;1000 streams marker is an accomplishment. But it doesn’t seem to be helping me break the next barrier of what’s next after that.

I’m currently preparing my next release. I put lot of efforts in this single, but also some money on the artwork and mastering (paying for these two was totally new to me). So I’ve focused on making quality this time.

My current fanbase is very small, and I was thinking of targeting playlists on Spotify, to reach more people and maybe fans.

For the moment, I’ve only heard about Spotify pitch tool, directly emailing a curator (pretty time consuming?), or using platforms like Submithub or Groover (legit?).

But if I get this straight, I have to know exactly what genre and what potential category of audience my song has. Which is sometimes difficult at the beginning of a career.

What is your experience with these? Did it pay off? Are playlists the best way to reach new fans?

For instance, if you have the time, which kind of genre/playlist type could I reach with my song, and how?

mwds0o,1619122763.0,musicmarketing,Azarov_A,A small SubmitHub review. Might help someone,"So I've been away from promoing and other music related things for almost 10 years. Forums and Myspace are gone now. Whatever we have now is really federated and weird (send email to promote yourself like in 1998 :D). Plus I'm not in any scene at all - all my music related friends either moved on or out of my reach as I emigrated.

Decided to try Submithub and here's my experience releasing my first album Journey myself without any label via Distrokid and with self-promoting.
I'm a blank slate, had 10 followers on Soundcloud or something and most likely those are bots. Also I have no friends outside my local circles and family.
The genre is Epic melodic Drum and Bass which is not competitive BUT has an extremely high barriers of entry and is absolutely not mainstream at all. And of course I did not think that short tracks are a requirement. My shortest one is 6 minutes, longest 9:25.
This might help you what to look out for and how to actually promote yourself in a more efficient way.

**Marketing budget**

I used a metric ton of money to legitimise this release - various subscriptions and sample library purchases. Whatever I used 10 years ago I had to rewrite with new tools and royalty free cleared samples. So my budget was tight, I set it at $250 max. For an album of 5 songs it's $50 per song which is pretty tight. With a few discounts and credits it came out to about $232. It summed up to a total of 300 premium credits with 3 awarded by SubmitHub a bit later. I used some (around 15 credits) to promote the first single I released before the album and a I still have around 26 remaining. I also earned a few reviewing music through ""Hot or Not"" (around 25 I think)

**Submitting**

I've read beforehand an article on submitting. I needed a strategy due to large number of tracks and very small number of curators. First move for me was to focus on the shortest track most to catch attention and then push most of my album. Out of 5 songs I ranked them from technical standpoint and from melodic as well. Like in chess you have to sacrifice something first. I decided to go with the most well produced banger (meaning the melody is catchy but not symphony grade). First of all I skipped on 90seconds listen and opted-in for review as per that article. This made at least most of them listen for more than 90 seconds. I picked curators but decided not to exclude Soundcloud, just radios. So I had bloggers, Spotify playlists and Soundcloud. However for some reason I won less Spotify playlists and more Soundcloud. After submitting first I received a lot of controversial replies, however within many reviews you could see that even a 6 minute track is something out of ordinary for typical SubmutHub curator. Seems the most they can do is 5 minutes tops. For the next album and singles collection I set a limit of 3:35 to 4:45 but no more than 5 and no less than 3 minutes. After receiving some major approvals for Soundcloud my track got 20-40 streams a day on SC, however it barely affected other tracks of the album.

Many curator declines were related to having the genre listed while what they had on accepted was absolutely different kind of music. Before posting to curator read their message and check their approved tracks.
Many curators say they have a lot of listeners BUT it's a combined number, they might have 100 playlists with 100 listeners each and hundred tracks each. That means VERY low numbers in actual streams if any at all and their overall number will have 10000 listeners which is not true at all. Some have a lot of listeners but not in the advertised genre. It's important because you will pay $$$ for nothing!

The next track I promoted was a 9:25 goliath which took a lot of coordination and work to mixdown. Surprisingly it did better with bloggers (might be due to 3 part structure of different rhythm - dubstep, dnb and house). Despite getting to one of the top bloggers it didn't do well 6/35 approvals

Third track I focused on high profile Spotify lists - it fit perfectly some of the lists so it got accepted. Gaming playlists are the best to get some streams. It is still pretty long but the intro was short enough not to loose curators attention. This gave me the most streaming on Spotify however once again nothing for other tracks.

The fourth track to get submitted was actually the opening one on the album. However despite being a pretty straightforward dnb without much extreme changes (just one small interlude with dubstep between 2 parts) and being just a 6 minute track it should've gone easy. Yet it didn't. Moreover I started seeing ""bot"" replies. Meaning the curator copy-pasted same thing over all last 3 songs submitted. I'd call this curator fatigue?

Basically after some time it seems like curators auto disapprove without even listening. Some didn't listen at all (having 30 seconds listening mark). I also got a lot refunded multiple times due to just no reply. Some approved but didn't share at all.

Additional thing I did really well in SubmitHub charts, got some love in Hot or Not and the First track was in the top of some charts and even the main chart which undoubtedly helped propel some of the tracks I submitted for later as they just got auto-approved in places where I got declined before with the First track.

Finally I tried some influencers for the First track and surprisingly it went better than expected. Out of many influencers just one made a really bad video with barely heard track. Others did their job properly and the tracks got some traction in their home countries judging by the Spotify for Artists reviews.

One thing to note is that many playlists aim at lo-fi relaxin music, even if you request heavy dnb which is ridiculous. But seriously this is a goldmine if you bear to write easy relaxing tracks.

**TL;DR**

To get your music out aim for shorter hits, I think it applies to all music and all people. Their attention is important, no matter that your are undiscovered Mozart or Kraftwerk in the background.

Build a strategy and mix and match curators, might be a better idea to have different pictures for each song on Soundcloud while promoting so they can't discern your tracks by artwork. It's definitely important to skip some curators despite their numbers. For example one Soundcloud account has a lot of ""users"" but no one actually as they all come from Frankfurt-am-Main which is a big city but also has a lot of datacenters of Hetzner. So while you get streams you don't actually get fans or people interested.

Despite the promo I got for which I'm immensily grateful it didn't help with album being popular. I'm still looking for a way to create a fan base instead of different songs in different playlists. I got some via promoting on genre-based forums and groups and subreddits but almost none via streaming, people like the track, not you or your music. This was mentioned before by a lot of SubmitHub reviewers by the way.

It is much better to use Hot or Not before curator request to get yourself into charts. Also the reviews there are pretty good, at least I try doing the technical review more without emotions included. With chart support you will get much more output from curators and influencers.

Read about curators and check their track record. Also keep your own records. I now have my personal blacklist of curators :)

Many curators ask about promotion of pre-release albums which is also very important. I had none of that, I released first. That made me loose some of the curators straight away.


Cheers and don't judge much. I'm pretty sure some people will find this useful.

mtmfb2,1618782862.0,FurryMusicians,-Vulpesvulpes-,PSA for solo musicians trying to get their stuff out (Marketing),"Heya!

So, while working a bunch on my projects and together with other artists, I've got quite a bit of experience working with different tools, sites and platforms.

As a little marketing PSA and tip if you ever intend to take some money into promoting your stuff:

- Stay away from SubmitHub and similar sites designed for playlisting unless you take really long and careful time to really examine the pages you're submitting to. Many of them won't do shit or will just take your money and ignore you.

- In the same breath, paying for playlist services like on fiverr or whatever to boost streams or get on playlists is not only against TOS (which can result in you being banned from Spotify) but also a complete scam. None of these playlists will result in streams, and most if not all streams will be botted and in the end not count to your earnings or stick around to listen to it in the future.

- If you want to go the route to promote via Twitter/Facebook/Instagram ads make sure you absolutely know what you're doing, your targeting is on point and your visuals look good. (Don't bother doing anything without a visual).

- If someone random promises to do cool stuff for you for money, they're usually lying or suck unless they're a registered professional. But those won't come cheap.

- A good spend of your money is an editor or artist who's able to make a cool cover art, short video preview for socials, or a nice visualizer to make you stand out from the rest.

- Spotify ads (as in, using the Spotify Advertising platform) is not worth your time or money unless you're a really really REALLY good speaker and have somewhat of a fanbase already (1k+ listeners) and make a short spot introducing yourself rather than just playing your music.

- Google/YouTube ads are incredibly complicated. Either spend a few days/weeks going into the material or hire a professional to do it. Otherwise you'll be throwing your money out the window.

Feel free to ask any questions, I'd be happy to help out where I can and give some answers if I have any!

(don't bother doing anything without a visual).  if someone random promises to do cool stuff for you for money, they're usually lying or suck unless they're a registered professional. but those won't come cheap.  a good spend of your money is an editor or artist who's able to make a cool cover art, short video preview for socials, or a nice visualizer to make you stand out from the rest.  spotify ads (as in, using the spotify advertising platform) is not worth your time or money unless you're a really really really good speaker and have somewhat of a fanbase already (1k listeners) and make a short spot introducing yourself rather than just playing your music.  google/youtube ads are incredibly complicated. either spend a few days/weeks going into the material or hire a professional to do it. otherwise you'll be throwing your money out the window. feel free to ask any questions, i'd be happy to help out where i can and give some answers if i have any! r/musicmarketing is great for more on this topic as well.",11,372
mtkl34,1618777169.0,musicmarketing,triangleface333,Just launched a platform to help hip hop creators sell/buy beats.," 

Hey r/musicmarketing! I hope this is okay to post here - I just launched a platform called 808Link ([www.808link.com](http://www.808link.com/)) that may be useful to some on this sub.

808Link uses a model similar to SubmitHub to help producers pitch beats to artists looking for beats of that particular style. Producers use virtual credits to pitch beats to specific artists, who are then required to listen to at least a portion of the beat and provide feedback. By paying a micro-fee (\~$1) for the artist to listen to the beat, the producer gets the peace of mind that the artist actually listened, and the artist gets paid to listen to beats (which they are already doing). Additionally, the artist knows that the beat they're hearing was probably not spammed to every artist on IG; rather, the producer had that specific artist in mind. Then, if the artist wants to buy/lease the beat, the two parties are connected to complete the transaction. 

The idea came from being involved in a number of music creator subs on Reddit and seeing great producers struggling to cut through the clutter and find the right artists to buy/lease their beats. 

We’re currently in our “beta”, I’d love to hear any feedback from this community! Also feel free to ask any questions - we’ll keep updating our FAQ located on the front page of the site.",5,0.69,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicmarketing/comments/mtkl34/just_launched_a_platform_to_help_hip_hop_creators/,Just launched a platform to help hip hop creators sell/buy beats.,just launched a platform to help hip hop creators sell/buy beats.,"  Hey r/musicmarketing!

mpy01i,1618302080.0,spotifyplaylist,Roark_Records,[REQUEST] - Looking for some advice on a playlist project for unheard/underground/hip hop gems,"I have a friend who is an up and coming artist releasing their first few  tracks and the amount of scams/snakes (obviously not everybody) on  Spotify curator sites like Submithub or Playlistpush where the curator just basically asks for money for a placement, what happened to the  actual quality of the music?

We  are going to have a strict no-payment for placement policy regardless of  how much they would hypothetically offer. We want to give the artists  at least some power to get heard and **organically grow through the playlists**.

The main concept is we have a four playlists setup with the following guidelines:

A. songs with under 1,000 streams

B. songs with 1,000-9,999 streams

C. songs with 10,000-99,999 streams

D. songs with 100,000-999,999 streams

As  the artist grows, they tier up, they can grow up to the top of the  playlist, it can form a community of up and comers, collaborations, and  an opportunity for hip hop and music lovers to discover and be a part of potentially the next big thing (which can be an incredible feeling!). We will follow the metrics closely and continuously update the playlists  and can provide an incredible organic experience when they ""level up"" to the next tier of the playlist!

Let  me know what you guys think of the concept and if you have any artists  in mind that are looking for opportunities to actually grow through Spotify playlists without all the bots bullshit or shelling out money to BS agencies, feel free to share with them and would love to hear their  feedback as well.

It's just that I feel that when I release music there ARE people who WOULD enjoy it - but I'm such a loner and such a homebody I have no idea where they are.

and I get it. Upload to Spotify and see what happens.

But Spotify is just an algorithm. 

If I have a song that's good.... there are so many questions in between the finish and how to get it out. Like for example - maybe Indian people  would love my music. But I don't know how I would ever figure that out without hoping and praying it MAGICALLY ends up in someone's feed.

For an example, I had a song get 500 plays in a few weeks on Youtube because Siri was glitching out and recommending some people my song on Youtube when they asked for directions to a local cafe in Kansas. So I had all these comments, ""Siri sent me to your song but I don't regret it!""

I don't feel comfortable hoping and praying for something like that. But it showed that people did like the song if they heard it. But it took an algorithm glitch to get there....

Then there's sites like SubmitHub. I'm not well versed on the blogisphere. I have NO idea WHO to submit to. So I get a ""This is really good. Don't have a fit for it right now. Send me other stuff though!"" on SubmitHub. Ok. Idk what you want nor am I going to make music tailored to your taste.

Is there any helpful service I can kick down some cash to that would at least help get these Spotify links to people who would actually appreciate it?

mffwc3,1616985320.0,musicmarketing,summittrekker,Post single release analysis and thoughts on the future,"I just released a new single a bit over a week ago and now I'm assessing the initial reaction as well as reflecting on my future as an artist.

I'm a small time artist so I guess I have to temper my expectations, but I'm still a bit disappointed with the numbers I've had on Spotify and on the music video on YouTube.

I have started posting daily on my Instagram, I pitched to media blogs and radio a week in advance and I pitched on Spotify for Artists five weeks in advance.

My Instagram has around 475 followers, my Twitter has 550 and my Facebook has 1400 followers. Despite this I've only had 108 streams on Spotify and 203 views on YouTube. While I understand these social media platforms don't show your content to all your followers it's frustrating that I have such low numbers. Back in the day of selling CDs I'd be happy enough with selling 100+ CDs, if I sold them at $10 each that's $1000 to cover some costs. It's easy these days to feel bad about anything less than several thousand streams, or wanting 100K-1M streams per release.

In reality, I don't need thousands of followers on social media, if the people who already follow me supported my music. But as you can tell, they're pretty disengaged. Or at least, they engage with my posts but don't go and stream the music. I will run some ads on Facebook and Instagram this week with content I've made specifically for the timeline and for stories.

I didn't get added to any Spotify editorial playlists but I managed to have the song added to a music blog playlist that has 5000 followers, another playlist with 1000 followers and a couple of smaller playlists with less than 100 followers. So far I haven't seen any flow on plays but it's only been a few days.

My song was premiered on a hip hop radio show and I've had it covered by one music blog that I landed via SubmitHub. All of the blogs I pitched via email ignored me. Blogs aren't a huge loss though, most only get a few hundred views and their Spotify playlists aren't followed by many people. Blogs are a waste of time overall I find these days.

Considering all of the above, what's your take? To be honest, while I do this for fun and don't expect any fame or to ""make it"" it does feel a bit like a tree falling in the woods with no one to hear it, or shouting into the void.

I've been making music since 2007, I've released two EPs and two albums with the latest album in 2015. From there I released one song a year. Now before everyone jumps on this - I know that's nowhere near enough. I've had a lot of personal stuff I've dealt with in the last few years which took priority plus I've focused on my day job / career. I should be releasing at least a few times a year. If I had more passion, time and money I'd release every month but I don't think my heart is in it anymore.

Here's the current Spotify streaming numbers for my last six singles, including this one:

Song 1, released 2016 - 24,000 (was added to a Spotify editorial playlist, hired a publicist - the rest didn't get any playlists and I did my own publicity)

Song 2, released 2017 -  341

Song 3, released 2018 - 489

Song 4, released 2019 - 147

Song 5, released 2020 - 141

Song 6, released 2021 (current single) - 108

For such meager results I've put in a lot of energy and effort. As Kenny Rogers said, you gotta know when to hold 'em and know when to fold 'em, and I think it's time to fold 'em. I have one more song I've written. The plan is to record it, release it in the next couple of months then that'll be it.",16,1.0,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicmarketing/comments/mffwc3/post_single_release_analysis_and_thoughts_on_the/,Post single release analysis and thoughts on the future,post single release analysis and thoughts on the future,"I just released a new single a bit over a week ago and now I'm assessing the initial reaction as well as reflecting on my future as an artist.

menqba,1616882396.0,askmusicians,AutoDemolisher,I've been getting a lot of critique that my vocals don't fit well with my tracks and I'm honestly clueless what I should do now,"I've used sites like Submithub and other ones to get critique from ""professionals"" but they always say that the instrumentals of my track are good but that my vocals aren't and that I need to tune them. I've been using Bandlab to try and make it sound a bit better and I guess it's a bit better when I use all these available tools but most of the time, I'm not even sure what I'm doing. I've already watched multiple tutorials online and they helped a bit but I still feel a bit lost. I know this is a subjective matter and all but it's just that I've barely gotten any good feedback and I just want this to work.

Sometimes I think my voice might not be suited for singing in the first place. I live in Belgium and for some reason I thought to myself: why not create an album in German (not my native language)? And I did that but like I have no clue what a German-speaking audience thinks about this. I probably sound like a foreigner to them. I'm very sensitive to criticism and even though some of them say ""keep creating music"" or something like that, that doesn't really motivate me. Some days I just feel like giving up. Doing everything alone from creating the beat to singing and mastering the track is sometimes a bit too much, but it's not like I have the money to pay someone to do something for me.

m99tg8,1616255813.0,musicmarketing,Clyderouge,Save some time and money on Submithub,"Hey,

I wanted to put this post up to help some people do exactly what the title says. I see Submithub getting a lot of stick in this thread so I wanted to share my experience from this week.

I make House music. Some might say it's Funky House, some might say it's Deep House, some Tech House and some may call it something completely different. And therein lies the problem. For my latest House music release I went on to Submithub to try and find some playlists to submit to. After scrolling though what seemed like around 100 curators with playlists that support 'House' I settled in the end on 5. After actually listening to the playlists the curators have I soon found that my idea of House and their idea of House is often, very far apart. This is not to say I'm right and they are wrong or vice versa, this is simply to point out that genre matching on Submithub and then submitting to everyone who supports your genre is a sure fire way to get disappointed and throw away your money. After listening to dozens upon dozens of 'House' playlists I've found only 5 that I think MIGHT like my track. So far 3 have accepted and I'm still waiting to hear back from 2. 

Sure, lots of the irrelevant playlist have maybe 100k+ followers and I would LOVE to tap into that fanbase but quite simply, they're not likely to want my music. For my last 3 releases I have taken the time to listen to every playlist (skipping through an absolute minimum of 3 tracks per playlist) before submitting and I now have a success rate of about 70-80%. My music is by no means mind blowing or earth shatteringly amazing, I just take more time to carefully select my submissions. It takes a little longer but the time I spend is well invested and I spend way less on campaigns because I don't waste many submissions. This might seem like a lot more effort. It is. But it's also worth doing if you're like me and don't like to throw money away.

So, I'm just saying that the tactic of genre matching alone is really only a starting point for submissions and probably not a green light to send your track to 100 curators that Submithub say have playlists for your style. 

Anyway, have a great weekend!

After scrolling though what seemed like around 100 curators with playlists that support 'House' I settled in the end on 5. After actually listening to the playlists the curators have I soon found that my idea of House and their idea of House is often, very far apart. This is not to say I'm right and they are wrong or vice versa, this is simply to point out that genre matching on Submithub and then submitting to everyone who supports your genre is a sure fire way to get disappointed and throw away your money. After listening to dozens upon dozens of 'House' playlists I've found only 5 that I think MIGHT like my track. So far 3 have accepted and I'm still waiting to hear back from 2.  Sure, lots of the irrelevant playlist have maybe 100k followers and I would LOVE to tap into that fanbase but quite simply, they're not likely to want my music. For my last 3 releases I have taken the time to listen to every playlist (skipping through an absolute minimum of 3 tracks per playlist) before submitting and I now have a success rate of about 70-80%. My music is by no means mind blowing or earth shatteringly amazing, I just take more time to carefully select my submissions. It takes a little longer but the time I spend is well invested and I spend way less on campaigns because I don't waste many submissions. This might seem like a lot more effort. It is. But it's also worth doing if you're like me and don't like to throw money away. So, I'm just saying that the tactic of genre matching alone is really only a starting point for submissions and probably not a green light to send your track to 100 curators that Submithub say have playlists for your style.  Anyway, have a great weekend! Clyde","hey, i wanted to put this post up to help some people do exactly what the title says. i see submithub getting a lot of stick in this thread so i wanted to share my experience from this week. i make house music. some might say it's funky house, some might say it's deep house, some tech house and some may call it something completely different. and therein lies the problem. for my latest house music release i went on to submithub to try and find some playlists to submit to. after scrolling though what seemed like around 100 curators with playlists that support 'house' i settled in the end on 5. after actually listening to the playlists the curators have i soon found that my idea of house and their idea of house is often, very far apart. this is not to say i'm right and they are wrong or vice versa, this is simply to point out that genre matching on submithub and then submitting to everyone who supports your genre is a sure fire way to get disappointed and throw away your money. after listening to dozens upon dozens of 'house' playlists i've found only 5 that i think might like my track. so far 3 have accepted and i'm still waiting to hear back from 2.  sure, lots of the irrelevant playlist have maybe 100k followers and i would love to tap into that fanbase but quite simply, they're not likely to want my music. for my last 3 releases i have taken the time to listen to every playlist (skipping through an absolute minimum of 3 tracks per playlist) before submitting and i now have a success rate of about 70-80%. my music is by no means mind blowing or earth shatteringly amazing, i just take more time to carefully select my submissions. it takes a little longer but the time i spend is well invested and i spend way less on campaigns because i don't waste many submissions. this might seem like a lot more effort. it is. but it's also worth doing if you're like me and don't like to throw money away. so, i'm just saying that the tactic of genre matching alone is really only a starting point for submissions and probably not a green light to send your track to 100 curators that submithub say have playlists for your style.  anyway, have a great weekend! clyde",7,406

For anyone commenting blah blah we told you so; I know so. I am stupid. Please don't make my mistakes. Forewarned is warned etc or whatever the phrase is.

I think playlist [placement is a waste of time](https://najinsan.wordpress.com/2021/02/15/i-paid-for-spotify-playlist-placements-so-you-dont-have-to/), but that's another story.

There are various services that connect the producer with the curator and for a fee you can pitch their track to them. Prices vary massively so Submit hub it's anything from $0 to $3 and Soundcampaign it's anything up to $15 per pitch.

It's the latter service I'm warning folks about. I recently pitched to 12 curators, got accepted to 7 playlists with a cumulative reach of about 16k. Fast forward 2 weeks and my total streams is 290. I paid $160 for the privilege. That works out about 55 cents per stream. FML

But it somehow gets worse!
Of those 7 playlists the song was added, it has been removed from 4 at some point in the last 2 weeks. Of the remaining 3, 2 have yet to yield any streams and the remaining has produced....3 streams. 

But wait! There's more!
One of the playlists that accepted me had the curious distinction of not only removing the track after a few days but also yielded approximately 0 streams anyway. Its so funny I could cry!

I'd treat the integrity of playlists in platforms like Soundcampaign as extreme high risk and I think folks need to know that.

I'm not commenting about Submithub bc Jason will probably pitch in here. I like it there but for different reasons.

Finally, to reiterate, this is just a reflection of my desperation to get a few plays. And the fault is mine for not using better routes to build a fan base.

lt1cv5,1614357078.0,musicmarketing,dudelikeshismusic,Sometimes it's easier to think about what NOT to do.,"Every day I see musicians say something that amounts to ""I'm doing all of the right things, why am I not famous and rich?"" Sometimes we like to think of music marketing as some sort of step-by-step process that will somehow guarantee success and acclaim. I realized that this absolutely does not work for guaranteeing success, but you can sort of do the opposite and guarantee how *not* to achieve success with your music.

I am not a famous or rich musician. But, as a fan and someone involved in the scene, I have seen some things that successful musicians simply do not do. Here's my list, and I'm interested to see what other people have found as well:

1. **Release music less than once per year.** Long gaps between releases will pretty much always cause your fans to lose interest.

2. **Be impossible to find or contact.** Your stuff has to be available within a Google search. If you're not on popular platforms like Spotify, then you better have a good reason. You need to make it easy to find your stuff.

3. **Be inactive on social media.** You need *something* out there. No, you don't have to post selfies every day, but you can't be a ghost either.

4. **Be an egotistical dick.**

5. **Spend minimal time coming up with ideas.** You are far better off curating your ideas. People think that John and Paul just pumped out Beatles material and never threw anything away. They probably amassed 5x the ideas than what actually made it onto the albums. It takes a lot of brainstorming before you have a golden idea.

6. **Fake it.** Fans see right through it when ""artists"" are really just trying to make a cash grab. You have to be genuinely passionate about your art. Yes, all of those ""corporate sell-out"" popstars are passionate, stop lying to yourself. You can't fake being a Taylor Swift or Bruno Mars.

7. **Spend no time on presentation.** Since the 60's people have decided which music to buy based on the album art. Similarly, no one is going to take you seriously if your Spotify page is lacking basic elements, like a banner picture at the top or a bio. It just makes it look like you don't care enough (because you probably don't).

8. **Wait until your songs are perfect before you release them.** You will never release anything. Deadlines are essential (for me anyways).

9. **Rely solely on tools like Submithub and Spotify-curated playlists to promote you.** These tools tend to work best if you are already generating buzz for yourself. A lot of musicians think that their music is so good that they can send it to blog and playlist curators and have these folks bow down to the awesomeness of their music. Good luck. These people tend to care more when they see that people are already talking about your music.

Sometimes we like to think of music marketing as some sort of step-by-step process that will somehow guarantee success and acclaim. I realized that this absolutely does not work for guaranteeing success, but you can sort of do the opposite and guarantee how *not* to achieve success with your music. I am not a famous or rich musician. But, as a fan and someone involved in the scene, I have seen some things that successful musicians simply do not do. Here's my list, and I'm interested to see what other people have found as well 1. **Release music less than once per year.** Long gaps between releases will pretty much always cause your fans to lose interest. 2. **Be impossible to find or contact.** Your stuff has to be available within a Google search. If you're not on popular platforms like Spotify, then you better have a good reason. You need to make it easy to find your stuff. 3. **Be inactive on social media.** You need *something* out there. No, you don't have to post selfies every day, but you can't be a ghost either. 4. **Be an egotistical dick.** 5. **Spend minimal time coming up with ideas.** You are far better off curating your ideas. People think that John and Paul just pumped out Beatles material and never threw anything away. They probably amassed 5x the ideas than what actually made it onto the albums. It takes a lot of brainstorming before you have a golden idea. 6. **Fake it.** Fans see right through it when ""artists"" are really just trying to make a cash grab. You have to be genuinely passionate about your art. Yes, all of those ""corporate sell-out"" popstars are passionate, stop lying to yourself. You can't fake being a Taylor Swift or Bruno Mars. 7. **Spend no time on presentation.** Since the 60's people have decided which music to buy based on the album art. Similarly, no one is going to take you seriously if your Spotify page is lacking basic elements, like a banner picture at the top or a bio. It just makes it look like you don't care enough (because you probably don't). 8. **Wait until your songs are perfect before you release them.** You will never release anything. Deadlines are essential (for me anyways). 9. **Rely solely on tools like Submithub and Spotify-curated playlists to promote you.** These tools tend to work best if you are already generating buzz for yourself. A lot of musicians think that their music is so good that they can send it to blog and playlist curators and have these folks bow down to the awesomeness of their music. Good luck. These people tend to care more when they see that people are already talking about your music. 10. **Only promote your music.** No one likes the artist who leaves early at the show.

lr6mfu,1614151384.0,musicmarketing,abyssvoid1,"The devil's advocate to Blogs, Submithub, Spotify playlists curators and more","I haven’t been paid by anyone to write this.

Social media ads, blogs, playlists, Submithub and similar services are just tools.

They’re not evil or perfection incarnate on their own. If your song is really good, they’ll likely do wonders, even with a semi-decent, simply-planned marketing strategy. 

I’ll refer to these tools as “multipliers”— If your song is good, i.e. captivates 4 people out of 10 who listen to it, multiplying that number to the Social media/blogs reach could make it a great success. If that number is 0 out of 10, multiplying that zero will do nothing.  
 

All this fury I see against one of these multipliers like Submithub is incredibly dumb. First, a tool is useful only if you know how it works. Second, a tool has to be used in the correct way. 

Yes, of course there’s playlists and websites that promise too much and have obviously fake followers, plays and so on. But I doubt this happens to most tools that gets talked about here, because it’s fairly easy to notice payola or fake streams nowadays. Organic stats go a long way.

It’s stupid to say some blogs or some services are scams that get rich with your money. They are the little guys, in reality. Cheering for Spotify or for ads from FB and IG only increases the monopoly FB or Spotify has, and this only bites the musician in the ass in the long term (even more than usual).  
 

It is not the marketer/small musician’s responsibility to take the big guys down, of course, but it is your responsibility to research the tools that are available, use them correctly, and stop being a whiny bitch if they don’t work or saying anything that comes down to “they took money from me and did not get me the fame I wanted”.

i'm about a third of the way through my master's studies and felt it was time to start thinking about the future. i knew that i wanted to get into videogame audio and had to talk to my lecturers and careers advisors about how to proceed, but i decided to give SubmitHub a go for something fun on the side. after a few months of success from labels you don't really want success from and rejections from labels you do, i finally got the message. 

""excellent work. i think your material would work well on a downtempo label we manage. give all your details to us and we'll send you a contract.""

""excellent work""? ""contract""? i couldn't believe what i was reading. indie labels at this level don't hand out contracts, they just chuck your shit onto a spotify playlist with 50 regular listeners and take the 20p's worth of streaming revenue you've earned. i check all their pages and they seem legitimate. 13k soundcloud followers, some artists with a few hundred thousand streams on their biggest tracks, i'd finally hit the jackpot and i couldn't have been more excited. they send me the contract and i get this looming sense of ""hold up, i should get someone to read this cause i don't wanna sign some shit and get fucked over here"". i'm reading things like ""3 years"" and ""we own the rights to"" and such and i get a bit worried. i send a reply in earnest asking about how their payment is handled. i admit that my audience isn't the largest, and if they only pay a share of your streams and they don't put any effort into marketing then i'll be stuck in a hole for 3 years without the opportunity to do anything else with the music. i'd also heard of bigger labels paying advances to artists to fund music production, so i ask about that too, but i didn't *ask* for that. no demands, no negotiation, just asking for clarification before i signed a binding contract without knowing all the details. what i got back in reply was one of the most toxic, degrading and unprofessional emails i'd ever received in my life. 

he said i clearly didn't understand the music industry, saying ""no company in the world would give in to these demands"". in regards to the question about advances, he said 

&gt;Why would a label pay you for PRODUCING the music and then pay you again for SELLING the content? And after 1 year you'd just leave, because contracts are 'too long' for you? And the label would sit on the PRODUCTION costs and you would release such conten, paid by the label, somewhere elese? Yeah, no, this is not how it works...at all.

i really have to impress how these questions weren't ""demands"" in the slightest, and i never said anything about re-releasing the music somewhere else, he was just barraging me with imaginary arguments and rhetorical questions i'd never asked. when i emailed him back explaining my questions and asking why he was being so hostile, i got this; 

&gt;2 things:  
&gt;  
&gt;1) the contract explicitely states: NON-EXCLUSIVE ARTIST AGREEMENT. Definitely an advantage, if you can read and understand the most simple wording.  
&gt;  
&gt;2) neither was I „hostile“ nor rude in any way - maybe read again what I sent you in my last email when you calmed a bit down...in a day or 2. maybe you'll understand it with a less hurt ego then.

he called my ability to read into question because i wasn't clear on the legally binding contract he'd just asked me to sign, then told me to get my ego in check when i asked him why he was being so hostile. the biggest break i've ever gotten in the 10 years i've been making music and i have to turn it down because their ""A&amp;R manager"" is an absolute fucking bellend.

https://najinsan.wordpress.com/2021/02/15/i-paid-for-spotify-playlist-placements-so-you-dont-have-to/

But key takeaways:
there are various submission platforms that put you in touch with curators

they all have different levels of acceptance rates

the playlists vary in quality but some will refer lots of streams to your artist page 

playlists are sometimes run by labels and this can help you gain contacts

submithub has a Hot or Not feature which is very good when you want to establish what genre your music fits best and get objective opinion on your work

get ready for lots of rejections

A few things I’ve learned whilst promoting my latest single, firstly.. promoting doesn’t come free! Pitching sites charge, and there’s also a lot of scammers! but if you think you’ve got a solid track on your hands then check out submit hub! It costs but it’s worth it…

Secondly, be consistent, don’t give up after the first week! Most people give up and move onto the next thing… believe me, I started back in 2006. I’m still here… maybe I’m just terrible! I don’t know? That’s for you guys to judge!

Thirdly, help each other, follow artists on Spotify, add their tracks to playlists, playlists really help with reach!! 

Finally, accept criticism! Don’t let it crush you, learn from it, smile and carry on! Just because a few people don’t like your track, it doesn’t mean everyone thinks the same!

* Paying for pitching services such as Submithib, Groover and Soundcampaign works and you can increase your monthly streams on Spotify. I increased mine from 0 to about 2k
* The increase in streams does not translate at all well to followers. I gained maybe 20 followers.
* The success rates of different platforms varies wildly. Submithub approval rate was much less than Soundcampaigns.
* There are factors that dictate how many streams a playlist will refer. These are: track position on playlist, time on playlist, number of likes the playlist has. Before you submit to a playlist check how often it is updated. You want ones with *less updates*
* It is not worth submitting to Instagram influencers - the posts are too transient and short lived in my experience

ljk0uh,1613288009.0,musicmarketing,sodown4thecause,Learning how to effectively build your fan base and market your music [Resources For DIY Musician's That Want To Put Time In And Learn Effective Strategies],"I've been an independent artist for over a decade and have spent that whole time trying to balance creativity while learning the ways of the music business to help build my career as an artist. I studied at a college, almost finishing a bachelor's degree in music business but I dropped out the final year in 2013 because almost everything about the music industry had changed and most of what I learned wasn't relevant anymore. I read the *All You Need To Know About The Music Business* books since a teenager, read all the well known music marketing blogs, paid for promotional services, hired a real publicist then learnt how to do my own PR campaigns and still felt like everything I learnt and did wasn't making the impact I had hoped for. The more music I released, the more jaded I became about the industry.

After losing my job and hitting rock bottom during the pandemic, I was broke and the album I spent over 5 years working on had stalled completely. I had to sell all my recording equipment and for the first time ever I considered quitting music. The hunger to learn didn't completely die and I knew if ever I did finish my album I couldn't release it if nobody new was going to hear it. I read a comment on here about a site called www.Indepreneur.io and after signing up and completing a few courses, something shifted and while I was still depressed and not recording I finally felt like I had what I needed to reach new fans.

They are basically an online business college dedicated to DIY musicians, they have comprehensive video courses that range from 3-8hrs long with a team of very knowledgeable instructors. They go into the psychology of music fans and how to win them over, running effective Facebook/IG advertising campaigns, creating content guide, email list marketing, selling tickets/merch, album launch planning, a Spotify guide plus more. It's not free but it's definitely affordable, around $30 a month but for the wealth of knowledge they provide I'm a huge supporter. 

They also have a very active and supportive community in their private FB group that will help you with any questions. 100's of podcasts that I haven't had time to look at yet. I probably sound like I work there but I'm just really passionate about learning how to market my music effectively. Admittedly I've only completed a few of their courses but I can tell these courses are done by experts, created with care, they are engaging and structured like an accredited college. Plus they're always updating courses since the industry changes so rapidly these days.

I'm sure the above teaches PR pretty well but if you want to learn music PR from a group of the best music publicists, I'd check out the courses by www.CyberPR.com, some free and others not but it's another great resource.

Another resource is a **blog** that I've been following for years. www.PassivePromotion.com is by a DIY artist that tests out all these promotional services like SubmitHub, ToneDen, Feature.fm, Drooble etc. He goes above and beyond with strategies, advice, comparisons and being that it's all free, it's absolutely worth signing up to his mailing list so you get notified on new posts. 

Another course I've heard is good for Spotify streams using an FB ads strategy is Spotify Growth Machine. Haven't tried it but I'll add the link so you can check it out: 
https://hypeddit.kartra.com/page/sge

As far as **books/audiobooks** go I would reccomend How To Make It In The New Music Business by Ari Herstand and can be bought on his really informative blog https://aristake.com which also has courses I've heard are excellent.

Some **podcasts** worth mentioning, I've only listened to some episodes so if you have any other suggestions please let me know and I'll add them. The New Music Industry Podcasts, Musicians Can Thrive and DIY Musician Podcast.

If you know of any other resources please comment below and I'll add them. Have been actively looking for Facebook Groups but haven't found any aside from the Indiepreneur one.

**Music promotion companies**   

Promotion may seem so simple, but most artists don’t have this part of the process thought out and need help finding the right solutions for marketing their singles and albums. If you don’t have a target, you’re probably wasting money. If you only want to “make it” or “get your music out there,” how the heck will you recognize if you’ve done it? Music promo is most helpful when you’re working for something specific – blog coverage, a particular number of Spotify streams, email list signups for fans. You get it.

Trouble is getting those first 100 fans. My instagram is dead as all hell and I've never been super good with social media, so I'm in need of some simple, reliable strategies to garner a small fanbase to get us started.

First of all, from my previous (limited) experience in music marketing, my understanding is that, especially when it comes to hip-hop (which is what we're making), instagram is a good place to funnel fans and listeners. Is this a good starting point? If so, what are some ways I can get more followers going on my insta? I have some money to put into this if I need to and I have a couple of people who might be willing to invest as long as it isn't too expensive. 

I also could use some advice on the wild world of playlist placements. I've been using Submithub to submit to playlist and labels. Is this a valid strategy or should I re-access?

I've also been considering the possibility of hiring a public relations consultant/expert or social media manager. Does anybody have experience with this sort of thing, and in your view was it worth?

I just discovered this community and was looking to share my own experience and get some fresh marketing tips. 

So far, my brother and I started pumping out some acoustic piano tracks on Spotify, and have probably sunk about $30 in SubmitHub credits.

Two months in, we have 8 tracks and about 7k total streams.  Using SubmitHub, we made it onto a couple big playlists (~5k followers) and these playlists make up about 80% of our total 7k streams.  Our plan was to try and use this playlist activity to springboard the Spotify algorithm recommending our songs. 

I guess the big stroke of luck would be landing on the official Spotify playlists - that would be sweet.

So besides spending a bit on SubmitHub and developing our social media presence, do you guys have any further recommendations? Any good playlist curator sites / promotion services?

Hi everybody,
So I’ve been using SubmitHub for the past year or two, with some moderate success. Got lucky that one song had a bit of traffic and more than earned back the investment, so I’m pretty happy with that. However, as anyone who has used the site knows, it’s not exactly straight forward. Not only are there a bunch of bs bloggers/influencers/channels, but most of the time you just get rejections even if you fill out everything properly and match up criteria as well as possible. No biggie, it is what it is.

But I feel like it’s worth it to at least invest a good bit of time and money into continually promoting my work, and I’ve decided on a $150 monthly promo budget for a year, just to see where that might take me. I’ll continue using SubmitHub, but am also looking for other means, and wondering if there’s anything else out there that anyone could recommend and give their 2 cents on why. I do the other usual stuff like reach out to the people who have supported me in the past, use IG (albeit very sparingly cause that place drives me nuts), or just make sure and connect with the listeners as far as possible.

So here I am, willing to spend a bit of cash and put in the time and consistency, but unsure how exactly to go about it. I’m just a one-man gig and tend to spend all my time at the computer anyway. Just as you all, this is my deepest passion and I want so badly to broaden my reach. I’m sick and tired of pouring in thousands of hours with so little happening in return. It’s soul-draining. You know what I’m talking about.

Does anyone have any tips? Anything at all? I’m ready to listen and give it a hard push.

k5xoqu,1607003991.0,musicmarketing,The_Artist_Network,How to get your music on Spotify Playlists,"I've just written a very long post on my website about how to get your music on Spotify playlists. I noticed a few things to share:

Why do so many artists copy and paste a 'press release' into the Bio? A press release is meant for the press, not the public. The Spotify About section is an ideal chance to connect with fans, but most artists squander it by posting something really dry, boring and written in the third person.

How many artists are using Canvas or Spotify Codes? These free tools are available to boost your plays on Spotify.

Spotify Pre-saves are fairly easy to set up. Seems like a lot of artists aren't using them.

Services like Submithub, Playlist Club and MySphera get mixed reviews. However, if your music is pop, indie or hiphop they could be worth a shot.

Spotify advertising is under utilised. Some artists use growth hacking techniques by targeting low CPM countries like Mexico to boost numbers. The sudden increase in Listeners sometimes results in being included on a Spotify 'algo' playlist, which is the main aim (not more listeners in Mexico :)

Not enough artists embed a Follow button on their website. Given how easy it is to do, why not? A Follower then gets notified every time you tour or release new music.

If you perform Livestreams, Spotify enables you to promote them via the Songkick integration.

Dua Lipa has released 37 singles on Spotify during 2020. Each time it gives her a chance to submit to more Spotify playlists. Spotify is focused on singles, not albums. learn how to use it.

k5i2gc,1606942171.0,makinghiphop,TheRealKaiLord,"2020 Spotify Wrap Up - Try not to get obsessed with the numbers. You might think that if your numbers were 10 times or 100 times larger that life would be much better, but in reality it would be exactly the same. We got 100k plays and 1000 followers this year but our struggle hasn't changed at all.","The route to success in music is strange. You need to be really humble and honest with yourself. You may spend some time or a lot of time sending your music to your friends, to randos, posting it on the internet. Maybe you even spend money on submithub or something like that. You hope and pray and hustle and grind for attention... But.

How good is your music really? Like really really? The intentions might be amazing, but are the lyrics really 5 star? They are? Is the delivery of them 5 star? Did you get an amazing recording? Was it mixed really well? Was it mastered really well? What about the beat? Was the beat amazing even before you hopped on? Did you do it justice?

I don't think any of the songs we released this year were 5 star. I don't think any of the songs we didn't release or even are currently working on are true 5 star songs. They are good songs, maybe 1 or 2 are almost great. Maybe they even deserved plays, maybe some even deserved a save or two. But largely our plays and attention are the result of our grind, not because the music 'took off on its own.'

Remember this is an art. Remember these are skills. Remember how much room you have to grow. Realize that even at 10k Instagram followers or with 40k youtube views on your music video that you're not suddenly 'on your way' or 'about to blow up.'

You need a song that is truly 5 stars before your work will really stand out in a Spotify editorial pitch, before a ridiculously high % percentage of friends and random people who hear your song will be inspired to like, save or share it (how you blow up organically).

When you see someone with moderate success like us, you're just looking at someone who is grinding just like you. When you see someone with millions of plays, or someone who landed on a Spotify Editorial, take a listen. I almost guarantee what you're going to hear is at least 1 if not 2 degrees better than what you make. They earned that result by developing, refining and polishing their skills. Maybe they spent a lot of time hustling for attention too or maybe just a little.

Also lowkey-  what do you think its like when you have a song that has a couple million plays? From our friends who have achieved this they've told us - ""It's amazing for a couple weeks. Then I release another song that I think is as good or better and I hear crickets. I'm haunted by that 1 successful song that blew up a little bit.... wondering, how can I beat it?""

Guess what he or she has to do next? Develop their talent, polish their skills... Make better music... The same thing you need to do right now.

Keep your day job and never stop challenging yourself. The music making life you're living right now will be same at 50 plays and at 50 million. Keep grinding y'all.",363,0.98,44,https://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/k5i2gc/2020_spotify_wrap_up_try_not_to_get_obsessed_with/,"2020 Spotify Wrap Up - Try not to get obsessed with the numbers.

Realize that even at 10k Instagram followers or with 40k youtube views on your music video that you're not suddenly 'on your way' or 'about to blow up.' You need a song that is truly 5 stars before your work will really stand out in a Spotify editorial pitch, before a ridiculously high % percentage of friends and random people who hear your song will be inspired to like, save or share it (how you blow up organically). When you see someone with moderate success like us, you're just looking at someone who is grinding just like you. When you see someone with millions of plays, or someone who landed on a Spotify Editorial, take a listen. I almost guarantee what you're going to hear is at least 1 if not 2 degrees better than what you make. They earned that result by developing, refining and polishing their skills. Maybe they spent a lot of time hustling for attention too or maybe just a little. Also lowkey-  what do you think its like when you have a song that has a couple million plays? From our friends who have achieved this they've told us - ""It's amazing for a couple weeks. Then I release another song that I think is as good or better and I hear crickets. I'm haunted by that 1 successful song that blew up a little bit.... wondering, how can I beat it?"" Guess what he or she has to do next? Develop their talent, polish their skills... Make better music... The same thing you need to do right now. Keep your day job and never stop challenging yourself. The music making life you're living right now will be same at 50 plays and at 50 million. Keep grinding y'all.","the route to success in music is strange. you need to be really humble and honest with yourself. you may spend some time or a lot of time sending your music to your friends, to randos, posting it on the internet. maybe you even spend money on submithub or something like that. you hope and pray and hustle and grind for attention... but. how good is your music really? like really really? the intentions might be amazing, but are the lyrics really 5 star? they are? is the delivery of them 5 star? did you get an amazing recording? was it mixed really well? was it mastered really well? what about the beat? was the beat amazing even before you hopped on? did you do it justice? i don't think any of the songs we released this year were 5 star. i don't think any of the songs we didn't release or even are currently working on are true 5 star songs. they are good songs, maybe 1 or 2 are almost great. maybe they even deserved plays, maybe some even deserved a save or two. but largely our plays and attention are the result of our grind, not because the music 'took off on its own.' remember this is an art. remember these are skills. remember how much room you have to grow. realize that even at 10k instagram followers or with 40k youtube views on your music video that you're not suddenly 'on your way' or 'about to blow up.' you need a song that is truly 5 stars before your work will really stand out in a spotify editorial pitch, before a ridiculously high % percentage of friends and random people who hear your song will be inspired to like, save or share it (how you blow up organically). when you see someone with moderate success like us, you're just looking at someone who is grinding just like you. when you see someone with millions of plays, or someone who landed on a spotify editorial, take a listen. i almost guarantee what you're going to hear is at least 1 if not 2 degrees better than what you make. they earned that result by developing, refining and polishing their skills. maybe they spent a lot of time hustling for attention too or maybe just a little. also lowkey-  what do you think its like when you have a song that has a couple million plays? from our friends who have achieved this they've told us - ""it's amazing for a couple weeks. then i release another song that i think is as good or better and i hear crickets. i'm haunted by that 1 successful song that blew up a little bit.... wondering, how can i beat it?"" guess what he or she has to do next? develop their talent, polish their skills... make better music... the same thing you need to do right now. keep your day job and never stop challenging yourself. the music making life you're living right now will be same at 50 plays and at 50 million. keep grinding y'all.",58,518

k18kuv,1606365999.0,musicmarketing,thesillymedico,Marketing for a band that doesn't perform live (strategy doubts),"LONG POST ALERT : So, I'm an an Anesthesiology resident from India who is working most of the time in OT, ICU or covid care ICUs. Besides this I am half of a composer-producer duo who makes music in all genres, mostly clubbing together different genres with some Indian flavours. Me being in one place and my partner being in a completely different place, who is a busy hard working sound engineer, we both don't get much to work on the marketing side of the music.

My current strategy : usually I design the concept and program the song with my laptop and midi controller. Get a rough version done and send it out to my partner. We brainstorm on it, make the track better. And I usually find similar artists from #covers on Instagram and collaborate with them for vocals. Once the track is (half) done(with my rough vocal take), I get the cover art done, I have my friend who helps me get the press release writeup done (he is really good at it). I try to get a music video done usually animated or some stock or sometimes hire dancers to get a somewhat decent music video.

I email my music, PR and unlisted video out to some good music magazines, bloggers, mainly Indian and a few outside ones. Do a short campaign on submithub and groover. Then a week near the release date I send my music to BBC radio for a feature request. When everything goes well, I get  radioplay, listicles/feature on good sites, and once, we were lucky enough to be noticed by Spotify curators and got on Indiestan editorial playlist.

Once the song is out, I usually run an ad campaign on Facebook/insta stories, which is either a hit or a miss. We have been lucky in that till now.

Besides doing all this, we have around 3k monthly listeners on Spotify, the maximum streams we had was 14000 for one song which was a rap on covid in 3 Indian languages which got on a few good playlists.

All these things I do in my spare time and my main goal is to get exposure for the fellow musicians I work with, my partner who is trying to make a name in the Indian sound engineering scene and hopefully some exposure and fans for the artists we feature in our songs. Mostly all the expenses are paid from my pocket, with all the covid situation going on, I don't usually 0 balance at the end of the month.

 We don't do stage shows as it's practically impossible for me and my partner to do something like that. I make my music with a laptop, and akai mpk mini and ATH M50s. That's all the gear I own. I am a classically trained Pianist who haven't got to touch my piano thats in my home since the last 6 years as I never got to visit my hometown since then.

Where am I going wrong? What am I supposed to do that I'm not doing yet? It's all fun and I enjoy music as well as medicine very much and I would never give up one for the other. Should I consider the expenses that occur now as investments and hope that it will pay out eventually? Or should I be doing less and just hope a song goes viral?

jtkzyu,1605291437.0,musicmarketing,Circadian_k,How do I get my music noticed online in 2021? Youtube? Twitch? Facebook? Soundcloud? Repostexchange? Instagram ads?,"Hey guys, I'm a very new musician (just started making music about 8 months ago by myself in my closet like any proper bootstrapper) and... I find myself somewhat inundated by the process of getting my music to the people who would appreciate it. I've read many Reddit threads on music promotion, but all of it seems like it's a guess and constantly changing. What worked 5 years ago, doesn't necessarily work anymore right now. **Does anyone have really specific \*current\* advice on how to get my music in the sea of online music makers other than meeting people in person (ie shows etc)? And what areas might generate the biggest returns on my investment of either time, money, or a combination of the two?**

**My goal is to build a genuine community of people who enjoy and appreciate my music. The reason I make music is because I love it—almost the entire process. The reasons I want to share my music are layered but it's primarily to spread good vibes and good messages. So whether the money comes or not, I will likely continue to make and share music — I'll just have to prioritize it differently in the scheme of my life depending on if/what type of profits come from it.** 

**Given that, I also want to give myself the opportunity to capitalize off of my music in some way.**

**Questions:** 

Do I absolutely need to build an audience in-person first (or at all)? *(Covid restrictions make this challenging... which is why I ask)* Or is there some crafty way of bypassing this...at least temporarily?

Is reaching out to blog sites directly still a good idea? 

Do I have to have cool youtube videos for my songs to be noticed on youtube? Is youtube even a good place to try to get my music heard?

Social media ads? yay nor nay?

Collabs? How important are they really?

Is the age of ""organic"" online traffic over in terms of any of the media giants? (Youtube, twitter, FB, ig, Soundcloud)

Are there any **new** sites or companies that help with music promotion/getting your music to listeners?

And... Twitch.  How would I use this as a rapper/singer? I'm completely perplexed by it to be honest. 

&amp;#x200B;

**For context**: While I'd (of course) like to give myself a shot at making money while spreading messages I care about (and getting to do one of the things I love: make music), music is currently a hobby. I'm not prepared to allocate more than a fraction of my resources (time/energy/money) towards promoting it at this time. But a fraction is a fraction! So I'm trying to do what we are all likely trying to do: figure out the most effective ways to get my music to the people who genuinely want to hear it/would benefit from it in some way. 

Right now, I distribute through Distrokid, I set up all of my pages on SoundCloud, Bandcamp, Youtube, FB, Ig, Twitter, and even a website. If I had to use an identity label to convey roughly what I do, it would be ""female rapper/singer."" I'm not sure if I would define the music I create as mainstream or not... but it's definitely different (Not so much what I've released so far, but what I plan on releasing over the next 6-months). Which has gotten me some praise and equally, supposedly caused me to be rejected from playlists and blog sites. Ie ""*Not different enough for us eclectic music-lovers*"" and ""*Not mainstream enough to put on our playlists*""... you know, that old chestnut. Also... admittedly production isn't the crispiest, most perfect, fantastic thing ever, seeing as how I'm bootstrapping (first used an iPhone to record, now I have a pretty cheap mic but good audiobox). But I do think it's good enough for most people to still enjoy it. Also - my rap name is ""K'sa Willcreate"" but some sites just list it as K’sa and that’s what my single covers say as well… hopefully that minor discrepancy doesn’t mess up anything for SEO? If it does, how should I go about changing it? Annnnd of course, knowing what I know now... might have been a good idea to come up with a very very unique name, but oh well. 

**More context:** I have about 30 finished songs I'm sitting on right now (almost all are very different style-wise- one is a rock/rap song, another is more pop, another is laidback (think Kota the Friend), some are heavier spoken-word types, and then a few are more in line with a song I released a couple of months ago ""Addicted to the Woah"" which I'd define as hyphy, bounce. So to be honest, I have no idea who my target audience is. I'm kind of all over the place (though there's some obvious tie-ins and stylistic things that are consistent throughout almost every song). 

*Sheesh, can she wrap it up already?!* (Brevity has never been my strong suit... but let me try) So, here's what I've tried so far in terms of I guess what we would call ""marketing"" or ""promo"" (prepare to be incredibly underwhelmed): 

&amp;#x200B;

*  ***Submithub*** (rejected by all playlists and blogs but accepted by one influencer on his Spotify playlist... received almost no plays from it). I have found it's a really great way to connect with other artists though. So that's cool... but I also know that those artists aren't my audience or listeners, just cool people to get to know.   
*  ***RepostExchange*** (I actually paid for something that I thought meant it would direct my music towards ""followers"" who were a. real and b. wanted to hear my type of music. That was woefully incorrect. All it did was give me 100 random followers on Soundcloud who are not interested in engaging with my music) -\_-

Phew, okay I think that's enough. 

Here's to my first time ever posting on Reddit.

Facebook? Soundcloud? Repostexchange? Instagram ads?,how do i get my music noticed online in 2021? youtube? twitch? facebook? soundcloud? repostexchange? instagram ads?,"Hey guys, I'm a very new musician (just started making music about 8 months ago by myself in my closet like any proper bootstrapper) and... I find myself somewhat inundated by the process of getting my music to the people who would appreciate it. I've read many Reddit threads on music promotion, but all of it seems like it's a guess and constantly changing. What worked 5 years ago, doesn't necessarily work anymore right now. **Does anyone have really specific \*current\* advice on how to get my music in the sea of online music makers other than meeting people in person (ie shows etc)? And what areas might generate the biggest returns on my investment of either time, money, or a combination of the two?** **My goal is to build a genuine community of people who enjoy and appreciate my music. The reason I make music is because I love it—almost the entire process. The reasons I want to share my music are layered but it's primarily to spread good vibes and good messages. So whether the money comes or not, I will likely continue to make and share music — I'll just have to prioritize it differently in the scheme of my life depending on if/what type of profits come from it.**  **Given that, I also want to give myself the opportunity to capitalize off of my music in some way.** **Questions**  Do I absolutely need to build an audience in-person first (or at all)? *(Covid restrictions make this challenging... which is why I ask)* Or is there some crafty way of bypassing this...at least temporarily? Is reaching out to blog sites directly still a good idea?  Do I have to have cool youtube videos for my songs to be noticed on youtube? Is youtube even a good place to try to get my music heard? Social media ads? yay nor nay? Collabs? How important are they really? Is the age of ""organic"" online traffic over in terms of any of the media giants? (Youtube, twitter, FB, ig, Soundcloud) Are there any **new** sites or companies that help with music promotion/getting your music to listeners? And... Twitch.  How would I use this as a rapper/singer? I'm completely perplexed by it to be honest.  &x200B; **For context** While I'd (of course) like to give myself a shot at making money while spreading messages I care about (and getting to do one of the things I love make music), music is currently a hobby. I'm not prepared to allocate more than a fraction of my resources (time/energy/money) towards promoting it at this time. But a fraction is a fraction! So I'm trying to do what we are all likely trying to do figure out the most effective ways to get my music to the people who genuinely want to hear it/would benefit from it in some way.  Right now, I distribute through Distrokid, I set up all of my pages on SoundCloud, Bandcamp, Youtube, FB, Ig, Twitter, and even a website. If I had to use an identity label to convey roughly what I do, it would be ""female rapper/singer."" I'm not sure if I would define the music I create as mainstream or not... but it's definitely different (Not so much what I've released so far, but what I plan on releasing over the next 6-months). Which has gotten me some praise and equally, supposedly caused me to be rejected from playlists and blog sites. Ie ""*Not different enough for us eclectic music-lovers*"" and ""*Not mainstream enough to put on our playlists*""... you know, that old chestnut. Also... admittedly production isn't the crispiest, most perfect, fantastic thing ever, seeing as how I'm bootstrapping (first used an iPhone to record, now I have a pretty cheap mic but good audiobox). But I do think it's good enough for most people to still enjoy it. Also - my rap name is ""K'sa Willcreate"" but some sites just list it as K’sa and that’s what my single covers say as well… hopefully that minor discrepancy doesn’t mess up anything for SEO? If it does, how should I go about changing it? Annnnd of course, knowing what I know now... might have been a good idea to come up with a very very unique name, but oh well.  **More context** I have about 30 finished songs I'm sitting on right now (almost all are very different style-wise- one is a rock/rap song, another is more pop, another is laidback (think Kota the Friend), some are heavier spoken-word types, and then a few are more in line with a song I released a couple of months ago ""Addicted to the Woah"" which I'd define as hyphy, bounce. So to be honest, I have no idea who my target audience is. I'm kind of all over the place (though there's some obvious tie-ins and stylistic things that are consistent throughout almost every song).  *Sheesh, can she wrap it up already?!* (Brevity has never been my strong suit... but let me try) So, here's what I've tried so far in terms of I guess what we would call ""marketing"" or ""promo"" (prepare to be incredibly underwhelmed)  &x200B; *  ***Submithub*** (rejected by all playlists and blogs but accepted by one influencer on his Spotify playlist... received almost no plays from it). I have found it's a really great way to connect with other artists though. So that's cool... but I also know that those artists aren't my audience or listeners, just cool people to get to know.    *  ***RepostExchange*** (I actually paid for something that I thought meant it would direct my music towards ""followers"" who were a. real and b. wanted to hear my type of music. That was woefully incorrect. All it did was give me 100 random followers on Soundcloud who are not interested in engaging with my music) -\_-  *  ***Slaps*** \- I posted my music on this through Distrokid and got very hyped up... then realized, most of those people are only liking and commenting to lift their own ranking.

jm77eh,1604255313.0,musicmarketing,MonsieurLeland,How long before release should one send music to blogs?,"Hi,

I will release a song in two weeks. It will be the first one of a brand new project, and I have 0 followers. Long story short, no one gives a crap about it. So it would be useless to start posting teasings a month before. Also, most of blogs want to post music that is already available on spotify.

jflbwp,1603313236.0,musicindustry,thelunaticinthehall,Been Using A Great Playlist Promo Tool (Playlist Supply),"I've been following this sub for a while, been never really posted before. 

I work in the music biz at one of the world's largest instrument manufacturers, but also have previous experience in the PR and Radio promo side, but I'm also a semi-professional musician who's toured the country and played a few stadiums, I've also played shows to an empty bar and even the sound guy left mid set. I've had a few bands and projects of my own over the years, and through my professional and music career I've met and worked with radio promoters, bloggers and music publicists, some of the biggest names in LA/NY/LDN, but have only ever gotten short lasting results (i.e. a few thousand streams on sound cloud, a few good write ups, a dingy SXSW showcase, or single moment FM airplay.) I spent thousands of dollars on all of these things for very little return, all in hopes that something might ""break.""

When quarantine started, I put out a demo of something I'd been sitting on for a few years, and thought that instead of spending money on all these things that had little effect, I should start doing some research on new playlisting apps since that seems to be where the industry is going for artists, especially with shows off the table for the foreseeable future.

 I tried a few out, like SubmitHub, Playlist Parrot and Daily Playlists, all of which landed me at a wall in about a week before needing to hand over money/or more money. These confine your music to a few checkboxes and I also figured out they aren't really pulling in NEW playlists, they would just serve me the same ones over and over (and I wasn't getting any responses). 

I dug deeper, and then on this sub, I came across an app called PlaylistSupply, gave it a try (it's $20 which is pretty affordable, even in COVID times). But this app gives YOU the ability to dictate search terms, not just genres. So I was able to start getting in touch with curators who vibed with my sound. I didn't have to only live in an ""indie rock"" or ""electro pop"" check box, I could search something like, ""workout jams"" or ""road trip."" Within a week of reaching out to curators, I earned more listeners than all my previous bands in terms of getting active Spotify listeners. I was hesitant that my listenership would drop off completely, but the beauty of this tool is I can keep trying out new search terms, looking up new artists I like, and I can keep finding new playlists to reach out to.  

I think what's most interesting about the app is that it looks so low key (almost like a screen out of the matrix lol) but the results are legit. I've even gone back to look up new search terms and found new contacts within them because someone started a new, relevant playlist. 

I can't recommend it enough, especially since it's so well priced and you *could* turn it off when you don't need it. 

If you don't believe me, check out [this review from a music marketer (Musformation) I follow on YT.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtqQyvVYbuQ)

What was also sick is that their team is willing to take calls with users to get feedback, I had a few things I thought could improve and I got an update from their founder Benji, who said a few of my ideas would make it into their next update.

Before we begin, here is some key data: I started writing music back in March 2019, started learning Vocal Production in April 2019, released my first song July 2019, 2nd one in August 2019, 3rd in November 2019. I own a Rhode NT1A (Mic) and a Audiolink III (Audiointerface). Nothing more, no fancy studio, no sound treatment (Costs were about 220€)

**The Journey:**
So here it begins: I just released my 3rd Track (Wasted) 2 weeks before Juice Wrld died. Since he was my favourite artist i was really upset about it (for the first time in my life i was really upset about a celebrity dying lol), which is why I wrote a song about him, XXX and Lil Peep (cuz i love all of them). I wrote, recorded and published the track (its called 21) 5 days after his passing. As always i did post the song on my social media. While going through Facebook i noticed that a lot of Facebookgroups have formed ""RIP Juice WRLD"";""Juice WRLD Memorial"" etc. I did join those groups and did post my song there. It was my way to honor Juice, XXX and Peep after all. I gained a lot of views and new followers through this kind of promotion (in numbers: I had 500 views in like 2 days and got 40 new subs on YT). So that ""marketing strategy"" (as vicious as it sounds) was pretty successful for a noname like me.
So thats all before i started posting a song every month. At this time i was sitting around ~80-100 YT Subs. So yeah, its March 2020 and i posted my next song and i started the challenge. From there on out did post a lot into the r/makinghiphop feedback thread to gain feedback, since i was still pretty new to production (obviously). The Feedback thread is imo a really good place to connect with people and potential new fans. There were a lot of people who listened to my music, gave me feedback, genuinely liked my music and did follow me on YT/Soundcloud. I also found 2 artist i did a feature with (which are both still unreleased). I can really say that due to real conversations with people and watching TONS and TONS (really) of youtube tutorials on how to mix vocals i got quite good at it. My old songs (my first 3) sound really badly mixed now. I even considered deleting one of them (Wasted) as the vocal mix was (and still is) so bad. 

Then all of a sudden: Its 31st March. I get a notification on Youtube. Some random Youtube Rainbow Six Player (6k subs at the time) did use my worst song (Wasted - the song i considered deleting) for a gameplay montage. He even wrote a comment in the commentsection telling people to check me out since im so unknown and he really likes my songs. I tell you guys i was blasted. Felt like i was already blowing up haha :D
Now, im not gonna lie, this was probably the biggest thing that happend to me in that time. I gained TONS of Views on this song and again a lot of following. I wrote a comment underneath  the video of his, saying that im grateful that he used the song and that he likes it, while mentioning that im gonna drop a new song next week (which made people interested in the next one). 
Simultaneously I did upload all of my previous songs (except my first song) on Spotify, so they'll be online on Spotify when my newest song (Perfect) gets published. Meanwhile this i watched videos about marketing and talked to friends who work in that field. I learned this: **You got to get people engaged. You got to make people feel like they are a part of this**
So, since i had 0 skills in Video editing i thought of a simple concept: I'll just write a message before and after the video. Something simple like ""Hey guys! I tried something different this time, hope you like it!"" and at the end ""Thanks for listening! See you next month!"". Later I implemented ""I'm always looking for good Beats! Send Visuals/Beats to @itsyungbeethoven on IG!"" Stuff like this. I showed them that im ready to talk with. Im not some dude who is unreachable, just doing his thing. Im here, you can interact with me. I answered comments and thanked them for the support. All this made it happen that Wasted, my worst song, is currently sitting on 7,7k Plays on Spotify. While all my other songs (at that time) are sitting between 700-1200 plays.
Alright. April, May, June go by and I, watching more marketing videos, learned another important thing. **I need a ""branding"". I need people to recognize me**. So i saved up some money and paid a friend of mine to draw me a logo (Costs: 360€), which i first showed in my Song Saviour on July 2020. The Logo + the way im editing my videos (Its really REALLY simple, i still have 0 skills but i watched some videos tho), is my way to brand myself since it kinda fits this emo/melodic style im going. 

**Marketing:**
There is only one Website I did invest 20€ into which is **RepostExchange**. It did help my SoundCloud following and gained me some fans. Overall I can say that im happy with the investment, but well, I kind of abandoned SoundCloud, so it doesn’t really matter.
Currently im trying out **SubmitHub** to see how well that works. I want to get into Playlists, but thats all really new and im still working on it (figuring out whether its worth the time/investment; Real Plays vs. Fake plays etc., I'll keep you guys updated if you wanna.)
I make a post on social media whenever I drop a song. I post on **Facebook** (450 friends) and **Instagram**(194 Followers, when I started I had about 120 Followers (mostly friends)) 
I use a App called Inshot to make short Videos (just the picture + the song) so I can tease my upcoming song a bit. I did try to use Instagram Ads to get some following on my Spotify. I invested 30€ for a 7 day Ad- campaign. It was a picture with the Text “Yung Beethoven – Maze” (since it was my newest song. Honestly this Ad did just get me 100 likes on the picture I posted, but it gave me 0 plays or following. It was a waste, but well, that’s experience.

I tried posting on **Twitter** but well, I don’t have a following there and I kind abandoned that aswell.

I get feedback on my newest Track on **Reddit**. I use the feedback thread for this. I give honest and detailed feedback. No “yeah, sounds good, keep it up” is going to get people connected. Noone is gonna support you, if you don’t give a shit about their passion. Really. Give People good feedback and you get to know a lot of people who can teach you one thing or another. Or they give you an honest ear about the mix, your hook, a certain phrase you used. I have several people I met over reddit which I send my tracks to, just so I can get their feedback.

**The Numbers:**

* Youtube: I started with about 80 to 100 followers on Youtube at March 2020. Im now sitting at almost 300 Followers on Youtube.
* Spotify: March 2020 i had 20 Followers, roughly 20 monthly listeners  (i think) (Short Sidenote: I participated in a Rap contest back in December 2019, which gained me those followers. It was the song ""wasted"" aswell. That was the only song on my spotify till i posted all of my songs in April 2020). Now in Ocotober 2020 I have 89 Followers and currently 451 monthly listeners). 
* Soundcloud: Well, i cant really track the numbers but i got some following there aswell. 159 followers at the moment. But honestly, I abandoned SoundCloud. Its not as interactive as youtube and you just get too much bots there.
* Overall: I have about 80 Spotify Streams daily, 30 Streams on Youtube daily, between 5-10 on SoundCloud.

**What i gained:**

Well apart from the subs as mentioned above the following things:
* Since i had to put out a song every month i now have a bunch of unreleased songs sitting there just to be released. That way i dont have any pressure since i always can put out on of those. It happens that I dont write a song in 2 weeks. Thats ok. I write/record when i feel like it
* I got A LOT better in vocal production. Really. You are on a schedule. It helps a lot in getting better and better. And since (as mentioned above) i dont need to pressure myself to write songs all the time, i can experiment a lot. I wrote a Punk song, I wrote a lofi song, I worte a Pop Song (which i released ""Maze""). I wrote and recorded about 20 songs in that time. Some never got finished. Some got finished but never released. Some did go into my collection, ready for release.
* I gained real fans. Seriously. I have people i dont know reposting my songs in their IG Stories. They write comments under my videos. The write me on IG telling me that they love my newest track. They play those tracks all the time (i had one dude pumping my song 21 about 800 times on Soundcloud, seriously, i even wrote that dude saying ""yo wtf!"" :D)

**The Costs (so far):**

Beats: about 280€
Equipment: 220€
RepostExchange: 20€
SubmitHub: 10€
My Logo: 360€
InstagramADS: 30€

Earnings: 20€

**The conclusion:**

While im nowhere near to be making money/blowing up/whatever im still really pleasently surprised with the results. I got a lot better in Production, gained a lot of true fans, tripled my Youtube Subscribercount and quadrupled my Spotify Following. I “earned” 20€ with all those Streams (which I honestly don’t care about, its all about getting out there.

So, was it worth it? That on you to decide, but for my part it think it was pretty much worth it. 
Next Song comes out on the 18th of October. Im gonna keep this up. If you guys liked this, I can give you guys a 1 year Update in march 2021.

Im going to sleep now,

see ya

Whether it's getting them to listen to it or complaining when my music gets rejected from blogs on Submithub, I'm always talking to them about stuff. But that doesn't mean I want them to give me advice on it.

So today my brother was listening to some funky hip hop beats on youtube, and lo and behold, he had the brilliant idea that THIS is exactly what I need in my music. Some of my music is funky/hip hop-ish, and I can kind of see where he's coming from. But for various reasons, I'm just not interested in adding this style of music into my current sound, especially since I've been super focused on going in a more rock influenced direction and learning to make similar beats would be very difficult and time consuming.

Advice like this bothers me. First of all, I feel kind of attacked (like ""your music is not good enough without the thing I'm saying would make it great""). I also know right away it's not something that I want to do with my music, but as a musician, I feel some pressure to try everything and if I say I'm just not interested in it, I'm being ""close minded.""

I've released more than ten albums over this time and tried my hand at self promoting on the internet.

My conclusion is: **its a scheme* built on an outdated model.**

It was really exciting at first, with all the possibilities of reaching people all over the planet. I'm mainly talking about music promoters, not listeners. 

I spent hours compiling excel sheets full of names and emails that grew impossibly large. Then crafting personal messages to each blog and label, and eventually getting responses and reviews here and there.

That was some 5 years ago. Nowadays I think music blogs are just a circlejerk of hype that nobody even reads. Musicians send their music hoping to get a review just to validate their music on social media. The market is over saturated with hyped trash and nobody bats an eye at independent producers. 

Medium sized blogs that could validate and spread your work now get their info on who to write from PR companies, period. I briefly wrote for one and still get multiple PR pitches everyday in my inbox

There's multiple scams promising to get you listeners on Spotify or reviews via submithub, but that's all it is, a scam. Don't throw your money at these services.

Now, you can think that the music I was making is just bad and that's why I don't get any attention. But just by the sheer amount of work and time I've put into this I think I have a pretty clear view of the lay of the land. It's the same mechanism that keeps people playing the lottery against ridiculous odds.

I'm giving up on promotion services for blogs and spotify playlist placement as I think these are just bloodsuckers in desperate market. 

I'll keep making music, playing live concerts and using whatever promotion methods are within my reach and go the Albini way, hoping someday my music will find its audience.

iizvqn,1598733999.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,couchsleepersband,How to get your first 10k monthly listeners — in response to a post made yesterday,"A user by the handle of u/WeakestBeast made a post yesterday with some helpful tips ey had gathered along their journey to 300k monthly listeners. One of these tips was to build a consistent listenership of about 10-50k people monthly before shopping around to labels — this *is* good advice, by the way, because a label needs to see that *you're gonna make this happen with or without them* before they're going invest a dime. But getting that first 10k monthly listeners can seem like an insurmountable first step, so I wanted to talk a bit about our personal journey.
    
—    

**A BRIEF INTRODUCTION**    

I've done this before. Shortly after our first release, we reached a monthly listenership of 50k at our peak. It's been six months since our most recent release (that first album) and we've settled into a comfortable 10-20k listeners consistently. And we do it all ourselves — recorded in my bedroom, mixed on cheap speakers with stock plug-ins, made our album art with an iPhone camera and some worklamps from Home Depot, cold calling playlisters and venues and blogs. Beyond my personal project, I'm involved in several other music projects, which range from 50-100k monthly listeners *consistently*. **While the fact that I've done this is an important qualification to actually talking about, I think probably more important is that I've been involved in a lot of really good bands that never even broke the 2k barrier, and I can tell you why.**     
    
—   

**A DISCLAIMER ABOUT THE FALSE DRAW OF MONTHLY LISTENERSHIP**    

But there's something we need to address before we get started: **monthly listenership is a red herring** as far as your musical success, however you may define it, is. It *is* measuring something, but it has power mostly because we give it power, and an even less precise measure because of that. **In all likelihood, your interest as a musician is not just getting your music in front of millions of people who will only ever listen once, but specifically to get it in front of the people who will resonate with your music.** The people for whom your songs are meaningful, the people who will become fans. I suspect that for many of us, *that* is the truer measure of success (even if we aren't always good at shaking off the delusions of fame and influence). **Monthly listenership does not measure that**. These are listeners, not fans. There are many, many, many musicians with 200k+ monthly listeners out there that struggle to bring 50 people to a show. The rise of the playlist has as a side effect the tendency to render music as ""wallpaper"", an accompaniment to people's days and not something with which they actively engage.

**Given, we and the people we want to impress (managers, labels, press) attribute quite a lot to monthly listenership.** That's the second failing. Goodhart's Law tells us that once a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a useful measure. Which is to say, when we put so much emphasis on monthly listenership, it ceases to be a good proxy for the quality or actual retentive quality of your music. **You can easily imagine that this number could be misleadingly inflated by fame or popularity without any regard for the quality of the music at all.**

So remember that this isn't the end-all-be-all. **Your goal is to reach as many future fans as you can, NOT just random people** — and that doesn't always look like 500k people right off the bat. I don't doubt that there's an audience of that many people for whatever your genre is, no matter how weird. There are a lot of people, and if you like it, odds are someone else will appreciate it as well. But finding them is a much, much, much more difficult task than reaching that first 10k of passive consumers.

**STARTING FROM NOTHING**

The first question to ask yourself is *what you really want*. Do you want this? I know *I* want it, and I'm going to assume you do too. But it's not going to be easy and it's not going to be fair. If you really want this, you need to turn a critical eye to your own music and excise everything that doesn't work. *Commit* to making the best possible art you can. You might not think of yourself as a songwriter, but you need to understand how a good song works. You might not think of yourself as a producer, but you need to know how to make things sound good. You might not think of yourself as a marketer, but no one else is going to do it for you and you need to get your music in front of people. You might not think of yourself as an influencer, but you're selling experiences and *that's the whole package*. So ask yourself right now, **what are you the worst at? What are you the best at?** Think long and hard about these things, then hit Google and commit right now to getting better at all of it.

**I am not saying this is a prerequisite. This is a continuous process. The biggest obstacle any of us will face is time, so don't wait for everything to be perfect. A musical career is just growing up in the public eye.**

But I know you're all doing that already, or you wouldn't be here reading this.

So you've finished your project and it sounds good. Great writing, tight production, well-mixed, well-mastered. Nice. You've got some slick album art. You're excited and ready to drop this project.

But you're not going to drop this project yet. This is the longest part, it takes patience and it's not nearly as fun as making music. No, you're going to wait. You're going to set a release date for two months, minimum, from now. And then you're going to start planning.

**GAINING AN AUDIENCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA**

First, let's get the social media logistics out of the way. Do you have a mailing list? Are you on at least one of the major social media platforms? I recommend Instagram and TikTok, which are by far the dominant platforms right now. Make a YouTube channel. Make a Bandcamp. Make a Soundcloud. Reddit, if you want. You want people to be able to stream your music even if they aren't on Apple or Spotify. Lock down an email address. Make sure your handle is the same for all of these.

The trick to gathering an audience on these platforms is to create something of value. And that value is important because it's specific and in-line with your artistic identity. **I use our Instagram as a place to keep in touch with our community** — I follow and interact with other artists and collaborators, I post daily snippets from the life of the band to our story, little musical videos, I even post about what books I'm reading. People are on Instagram because they're interested in you and your life, so it's nice to see behind the curtain and into the lives of you and your bandmates. **TikTok, on the other hand, seems to be entirely driven by a content-based algorithm** — this can look like a lot of things: funny little videos, covers of songs you like, dances, vibey lifestyle posts, rating different things, more informational stuff (our most popular by far were about DIY audio engineering). TikTok seems to prefer videos that show your face from the front, by and large, and anything that makes use of its in-app sounds, songs, effects, and features. Just a small tip. Do some duetting and reacting, people like that. What, you're not on TikTok? *Get on TikTok!* It makes me feel old and out-of-touch, too, but you've got to excise that discomfort and get after it. Remember, we're committed. **Facebook is useful for scheduling events, more useful if you have an older audience**. But even then, I'd use a mailing list. **The nice thing about email is it gets you away from algorithm-driven exposure** — now you can contact people you care about directly. **YouTube is a great place to do covers and gather fans from other, extant fanbases.** I know that fans of Pinegrove or Death Cab for Cutie will find something to like from our music, for example, so we've spent a lot of time and effort putting together some good quality covers. **I prefer to use Reddit in this way** — I spent years learning a lot from this community and it's great to be able to contribute, now. And who knows, maybe you'll gain some new listeners that way, too. You're welcome to make yourself a website, but to be honest I don't think it's all that important anymore. 

So you're going to spend your two+ months gathering an audience on *all* these platforms by posting regularly, engaging with others, and creating high-value content. Sneak in some promotional stuff for your music. TikTok seems particularly lawless — just post your song and people will start demanding you release it. This is a game of inches. It takes time. **And don't be afraid to direct your friends and family. Learn how to ask, you're going to need to.** Otherwise no one will ever even know you released it. But every person you gather becomes a potential vector of new exposure.

**ADS**

As a brief aside, if you have the money, ads can be really useful. The trick is to make it less of an ad and more of a normal post on social media. Engagement with videos is much higher. Spend some time making a short little video teaser and release video for your music. Music videos are even better! Try to spend at least $10 a day and use a targeted audience. If you've run ads before, try especially to focus people who have previously engaged with your material. You can have Instagram and Facebook promote you, you can have YouTube screen your videos before other relevant artists. And feel free to get creative with ads in the real world, too. Leave random letters inviting people to your show. Put up flyers! Collaborate with local artists to make cool merchandise and flyers!

**PLAYLISTS, PLAYLISTS, PLAYLISTS (AND BLOGS, AND RADIO)**

**Next, get on SubmitHub**. You're going to find yourself a couple blogs — as many as you can — to talk about your release. To be honest, I don't think too many people actively read blogs anymore, but you might gain a little exposure out of it. More importantly, it gives you another measure of legitimacy. People are talking about your music. You're going to share those articles when they're written, and people will be more inclined to check your music out having seen that other people are writing about it. **More importantly, find a couple playlisters to add your song**. With both of these things, it helps be *specific* about your targeting — do a little research. And it helps to have a little money for premium credits, the rate of acceptance is so much higher. But if you *don't* — and that's completely okay — you can earn them by rating others' music on Hot or Not. And **you should add your music to SubmitHub's Hot or Not** as well. Think of all the other appreciative musicians who are on there listening through Hot or Not. Someone might think your stuff is pretty hot! And then you've got a new fan as well.

But playlists. Someone commented in the other thread, ""Playlists, playlists, playlists."" And if you want to up your monthly listeners and *maybe even gain some fans*, this is the right answer. So ask yourself, who does your music sound like? Note, this is not *who do you listen to*, but who do you *sound* like? I love Frank Ocean and Theo Katzman, both have influenced my songwriting and sound *immensely*, and I sound nothing like those artists. But fans of Pinegrove might find a particular resonance with our music. I'm a new fan of Phoebe Bridgers (*Punisher* is such an amazing sounding album. I love Gruska and Mills and Berg's production, wow) but even before I liked her music I understood that others might find similar qualities. What's the strongest quality of your music? Now go forth on Spotify and find user-made playlists that have a similar vibe. Given them a listen. Now's the creepy part — and this process is long and tedious, too. Look at the user. Do they make playlists under their name? Do they have a profile picture? Great. Spotify pulls those things from Facebook. **Go find their Facebook profile, friend them, and send them a message cold.** Be courteous and respectful, be friendly and genuine. Let them know you've been digging their playlist. You really like X and Y artists, and because of their playlist, you found Z artists and you really dig it. You think your song might be a good fit. Send them a link and say, if you like it, I'd love it if you could add it to your playlist. This feels slimey and weird and it was one of the earliest forms of exposure we got beyond our immediate social circles.

**Don't forget about Spotify's playlist submission.** As long as your submit two weeks prior to release, you'll be put on Release Radar, which will let everyone who's listened to your previously know you've got a new song out. From my own experience, Release Radar can also expose you to new likely fans based on engagement, acting as a little mini Discover Weekly. **Discover Weekly is where you want to end up,** because Spotify will just continue shipping your song around to new fans as long as there's engagement. These things are both driven by engagement and sharing by users immediately following release, so all that work you put in above is going to be really important! And of course you can submit a song from each release for Editorial Playlist consideration, too! As always, targeting is key. Find the right curated playlist for your specific song, tailor your pitch to that playlist's vibe and content.

By the way, I recommend releasing a few singles before the project, and scheduling them to be four weeks apart. This way, Spotify will note the consistent influx of new listeners and the momentum you've built up, so it'll start doing some of the work for you. Plus, it gives *you* momentum to outside observers.

On a sort of related note, reach out to local radio stations! The students who run college stations are eager and have such a passion for music. They are fans just waiting to happen, and you'll find they're often friends waiting to happen as well. It is such a pleasure to sit down and chat with a couple students on the air and it costs you just an hour of your time, an enjoyable one at that. Likewise with podcasters! There are so many podcasts these days and I guarantee you know someone that hosts one. Reach out!

**PERFORMING LIVE**

Back before the beginning of the end of the world, we used to play live. **Live shows remain the number one way you'll convert a listener to a fan**. Try to maximize your exposure by playing venues with good foot traffic — venues with enough of a reputation that they bring their own listener base on a regular basis, potential new fans for you — and by pairing with other bands in the scene. How do you meet other bands? Be friendly and sociable, go out to their shows, listen respectfully, talk to them after, buy them a drink. You'll find your scene. Their fans will become fans of yours too, and now you two can support one another as acts! Build a community, collaborate, experiment, make new great art together. Play bomb shows together. And that extends to the people listening as well — put aside whatever discomfort you might feel and play your heart out; invite your audience to come and say hello after the show, to say hello to one another and make new friendships. They'll come to the next show, too, and bring friends.

**I want you to play at least two shows, a month apart, in the time leading up to your release.** More if you can travel (e.g., Brooklyn and Manhattan, separate enough audiences. Burlington VT is small enough that you don't want to oversaturate). Put together all that work for a big release show when your project drops — collaborate with other bands you've befriended, get a good Friday or Saturday spot. Hell, schedule a tour! We try not to release music without scheduling a little mini-tour for that weekend.

**Okay, so maybe you don't have a band, or you don't know how to perform. I encourage you to do it anyway.** Remember that we're committed here. You can repackage your music — it doesn't have to sound like the record. We recently played a live show online from my apartment. Unfortunately it's not really practical for us to play drums and thrashing electric guitars here, so we stripped it down, went acoustic, emphasized the harmonies, I play the piano. A different packaging, but I'm just trying to communicate my vision however I can. I've done videos of myself playing all the instruments. Whatever it takes. You can play out live with a laptop as a backing track. You can loop yourself. Maybe you're just a bomb musician, so you can just play and that's compelling enough. I'm not that way but I know plenty who are. You can do it! Just do it!

In my experience, colleges and DIY audiences are all really willing and invested fans. Colleges will also pay you quite handsomely!

Also the current backdrop to our musical lives is one of global emergency and live shows aren't really happening right now. There are still shows happening, but it's a bit of a different scene. Still, the above applies. Find a venue with a built in audience, find some collaborators within your scene, and put something together! Maybe you record it with your iPhone. You can get a great sound with a phone these days, just spend time getting a good placement. You can do it! Just do it!

**PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER**

Before our first release, I spent multiple hours doing this everyday. I would wake up, submit to blogs and playlisters on SubmitHub every four hours, cold message Spotify playlisters on my bus ride into work. I put together a show at one of the biggest, highest traffic venues in town with a couple bands from the area — friends I'd made by visiting their shows and being a part of the local scene. We collaborated with a local graphic designer to make these awesome posters.  I drove around an hung them at the local universities and all around town. I scheduled a mini-tour immediately to follow, hitting some of the major cities on the East Coast. I invited everyone I knew in each city. I reached out personally! I asked them to bring friends! We filmed parts of our future ad material at these shows with the audience participating. After the show, we packed up quickly and spent time hanging out with friends and listeners, meeting the people with whom our music had resonated. I posted to Reddit. Some of those posts flopped — which embarrasses me and I'm telling you about it now because that's a reality of what we're doing and we need to accept that. It's slow. But this is a game of inches and you have to keep going, right? That's the only way forward. TikTok wasn't around yet but you can bet I'd have been posting on there everyday if it had been. I did as many podcasts and playlists as I could. I reached out to local newspapers and did interviews. My friends and I all streamed the new song non-stop on our phones. I asked everyone I knew to share the song if they liked it, telling them it was a small thing they could do for me that would mean a lot for our band. There's really no way around approaching this with humility. Remember your commitment. Excise your ego. This is music, it's a compassionate act to begin with. You have to reach out to others and connect, and it's in forming that community that you will go farther.

By the time we released our second single, a month later, all that consistent effort and momentum paid off. Release Radar did a little better. We started seeing some consistent listenership. We were finding our fanbase. Finally, by our third single, things started working for us. We got a huge bump off Release Radar followed by a *huge* bump off Discover Weekly. We have two songs now that routinely get peddled on Discover Weekly and that has driven us to so many new listeners and fans — all because of that hard work we put in. And I am still doing it everyday, in between producing our new record and my friends' new record and, of course, going to work. It is very possible that we will never have our tinderbox moment, the big break, and find tremendous success, but I am determined to find as many people to connect with as I can and I am going to keep working as hard as I can to make that a reality. You can do it! Just do it! It is slow and hard work and frankly it is mostly discouraging work, too. But if you want it, I promise you can do it. This will work. It will *take* work, but if you show up and you keep at it you *will* see results. Good luck!",96,0.95,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/iizvqn/how_to_get_your_first_10k_monthly_listeners_in/,How to get your first 10k monthly listeners — in response to a post made yesterday,how to get your first 10k monthly listeners — in response to a post made yesterday,"A user by the handle of u/WeakestBeast made a post yesterday with some helpful tips ey had gathered along their journey to 300k monthly listeners. One of these tips was to build a consistent listenership of about 10-50k people monthly before shopping around to labels — this *is* good advice, by the way, because a label needs to see that *you're gonna make this happen with or without them* before they're going invest a dime. But getting that first 10k monthly listeners can seem like an insurmountable first step, so I wanted to talk a bit about our personal journey.      —     **A BRIEF INTRODUCTION**     I've done this before. Shortly after our first release, we reached a monthly listenership of 50k at our peak. It's been six months since our most recent release (that first album) and we've settled into a comfortable 10-20k listeners consistently. And we do it all ourselves — recorded in my bedroom, mixed on cheap speakers with stock plug-ins, made our album art with an iPhone camera and some worklamps from Home Depot, cold calling playlisters and venues and blogs. Beyond my personal project, I'm involved in several other music projects, which range from 50-100k monthly listeners *consistently*. **While the fact that I've done this is an important qualification to actually talking about, I think probably more important is that I've been involved in a lot of really good bands that never even broke the 2k barrier, and I can tell you why.**           —    **A DISCLAIMER ABOUT THE FALSE DRAW OF MONTHLY LISTENERSHIP**     But there's something we need to address before we get started **monthly listenership is a red herring** as far as your musical success, however you may define it, is.

They'll come to the next show, too, and bring friends. **I want you to play at least two shows, a month apart, in the time leading up to your release.** More if you can travel (e.g., Brooklyn and Manhattan, separate enough audiences. Burlington VT is small enough that you don't want to oversaturate). Put together all that work for a big release show when your project drops — collaborate with other bands you've befriended, get a good Friday or Saturday spot. Hell, schedule a tour! We try not to release music without scheduling a little mini-tour for that weekend. **Okay, so maybe you don't have a band, or you don't know how to perform. I encourage you to do it anyway.** Remember that we're committed here. You can repackage your music — it doesn't have to sound like the record. We recently played a live show online from my apartment. Unfortunately it's not really practical for us to play drums and thrashing electric guitars here, so we stripped it down, went acoustic, emphasized the harmonies, I play the piano. A different packaging, but I'm just trying to communicate my vision however I can. I've done videos of myself playing all the instruments. Whatever it takes. You can play out live with a laptop as a backing track. You can loop yourself. Maybe you're just a bomb musician, so you can just play and that's compelling enough. I'm not that way but I know plenty who are. You can do it! Just do it! In my experience, colleges and DIY audiences are all really willing and invested fans. Colleges will also pay you quite handsomely! Also the current backdrop to our musical lives is one of global emergency and live shows aren't really happening right now. There are still shows happening, but it's a bit of a different scene. Still, the above applies. Find a venue with a built in audience, find some collaborators within your scene, and put something together! Maybe you record it with your iPhone. You can get a great sound with a phone these days, just spend time getting a good placement. You can do it! Just do it! — **PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER** Before our first release, I spent multiple hours doing this everyday. I would wake up, submit to blogs and playlisters on SubmitHub every four hours, cold message Spotify playlisters on my bus ride into work. I put together a show at one of the biggest, highest traffic venues in town with a couple bands from the area — friends I'd made by visiting their shows and being a part of the local scene. We collaborated with a local graphic designer to make these awesome posters.  I drove around an hung them at the local universities and all around town. I scheduled a mini-tour immediately to follow, hitting some of the major cities on the East Coast. I invited everyone I knew in each city. I reached out personally! I asked them to bring friends! We filmed parts of our future ad material at these shows with the audience participating. After the show, we packed up quickly and spent time hanging out with friends and listeners, meeting the people with whom our music had resonated. I posted to Reddit. Some of those posts flopped — which embarrasses me and I'm telling you about it now because that's a reality of what we're doing and we need to accept that. It's slow. But this is a game of inches and you have to keep going, right? That's the only way forward. TikTok wasn't around yet but you can bet I'd have been posting on there everyday if it had been. I did as many podcasts and playlists as I could. I reached out to local newspapers and did interviews. My friends and I all streamed the new song non-stop on our phones. I asked everyone I knew to share the song if they liked it, telling them it was a small thing they could do for me that would mean a lot for our band. There's really no way around approaching this with humility. Remember your commitment. Excise your ego. This is music, it's a compassionate act to begin with. You have to reach out to others and connect, and it's in forming that community that you will go farther. By the time we released our second single, a month later, all that consistent effort and momentum paid off. Release Radar did a little better. We started seeing some consistent listenership. We were finding our fanbase. Finally, by our third single, things started working for us. We got a huge bump off Release Radar followed by a *huge* bump off Discover Weekly. We have two songs now that routinely get peddled on Discover Weekly and that has driven us to so many new listeners and fans — all because of that hard work we put in. And I am still doing it everyday, in between producing our new record and my friends' new record and, of course, going to work. It is very possible that we will never have our tinderbox moment, the big break, and find tremendous success, but I am determined to find as many people to connect with as I can and I am going to keep working as hard as I can to make that a reality. You can do it! Just do it! It is slow and hard work and frankly it is mostly discouraging work, too. But if you want it, I promise you can do it. This will work. It will *take* work, but if you show up and you keep at it you *will* see results. Good luck!","a user by the handle of u/weakestbeast made a post yesterday with some helpful tips ey had gathered along their journey to 300k monthly listeners. one of these tips was to build a consistent listenership of about 10-50k people monthly before shopping around to labels — this *is* good advice, by the way, because a label needs to see that *you're gonna make this happen with or without them* before they're going invest a dime. but getting that first 10k monthly listeners can seem like an insurmountable first step, so i wanted to talk a bit about our personal journey.      —     **a brief introduction**     i've done this before. shortly after our first release, we reached a monthly listenership of 50k at our peak. it's been six months since our most recent release (that first album) and we've settled into a comfortable 10-20k listeners consistently. and we do it all ourselves — recorded in my bedroom, mixed on cheap speakers with stock plug-ins, made our album art with an iphone camera and some worklamps from home depot, cold calling playlisters and venues and blogs. beyond my personal project, i'm involved in several other music projects, which range from 50-100k monthly listeners *consistently*. **while the fact that i've done this is an important qualification to actually talking about, i think probably more important is that i've been involved in a lot of really good bands that never even broke the 2k barrier, and i can tell you why.**           —    **a disclaimer about the false draw of monthly listenership**     but there's something we need to address before we get started **monthly listenership is a red herring** as far as your musical success, however you may define it, is. it *is* measuring something, but it has power mostly because we give it power, and an even less precise measure because of that. **in all likelihood, your interest as a musician is not just getting your music in front of millions of people who will only ever listen once, but specifically to get it in front of the people who will resonate with your music.** the people for whom your songs are meaningful, the people who will become fans. i suspect that for many of us, *that* is the truer measure of success (even if we aren't always good at shaking off the delusions of fame and influence). **monthly listenership does not measure that**. these are listeners, not fans. there are many, many, many musicians with 200k monthly listeners out there that struggle to bring 50 people to a show. the rise of the playlist has as a side effect the tendency to render music as ""wallpaper"", an accompaniment to people's days and not something with which they actively engage. **given, we and the people we want to impress (managers, labels, press) attribute quite a lot to monthly listenership.** that's the second failing. goodhart's law tells us that once a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a useful measure. which is to say, when we put so much emphasis on monthly listenership, it ceases to be a good proxy for the quality or actual retentive quality of your music. **you can easily imagine that this number could be misleadingly inflated by fame or popularity without any regard for the quality of the music at all.** so remember that this isn't the end-all-be-all. **your goal is to reach as many future fans as you can, not just random people** — and that doesn't always look like 500k people right off the bat. i don't doubt that there's an audience of that many people for whatever your genre is, no matter how weird. there are a lot of people, and if you like it, odds are someone else will appreciate it as well. but finding them is a much, much, much more difficult task than reaching that first 10k of passive consumers. —     **starting from nothing** the first question to ask yourself is *what you really want*. do you want this? i know *i* want it, and i'm going to assume you do too. but it's not going to be easy and it's not going to be fair. if you really want this, you need to turn a critical eye to your own music and excise everything that doesn't work. *commit* to making the best possible art you can. you might not think of yourself as a songwriter, but you need to understand how a good song works. you might not think of yourself as a producer, but you need to know how to make things sound good. you might not think of yourself as a marketer, but no one else is going to do it for you and you need to get your music in front of people. you might not think of yourself as an influencer, but you're selling experiences and *that's the whole package*. so ask yourself right now, **what are you the worst at? what are you the best at?** think long and hard about these things, then hit google and commit right now to getting better at all of it. **i am not saying this is a prerequisite. this is a continuous process. the biggest obstacle any of us will face is time, so don't wait for everything to be perfect. a musical career is just growing up in the public eye.** but i know you're all doing that already, or you wouldn't be here reading this. so you've finished your project and it sounds good. great writing, tight production, well-mixed, well-mastered. nice. you've got some slick album art. you're excited and ready to drop this project. but you're not going to drop this project yet. this is the longest part, it takes patience and it's not nearly as fun as making music. no, you're going to wait. you're going to set a release date for two months, minimum, from now. and then you're going to start planning. —     **gaining an audience on social media** first, let's get the social media logistics out of the way. do you have a mailing list? are you on at least one of the major social media platforms? i recommend instagram and tiktok, which are by far the dominant platforms right now. make a youtube channel. make a bandcamp. make a soundcloud. reddit, if you want. you want people to be able to stream your music even if they aren't on apple or spotify. lock down an email address. make sure your handle is the same for all of these. the trick to gathering an audience on these platforms is to create something of value. and that value is important because it's specific and in-line with your artistic identity. **i use our instagram as a place to keep in touch with our community** — i follow and interact with other artists and collaborators, i post daily snippets from the life of the band to our story, little musical videos, i even post about what books i'm reading. people are on instagram because they're interested in you and your life, so it's nice to see behind the curtain and into the lives of you and your bandmates. **tiktok, on the other hand, seems to be entirely driven by a content-based algorithm** — this can look like a lot of things funny little videos, covers of songs you like, dances, vibey lifestyle posts, rating different things, more informational stuff (our most popular by far were about diy audio engineering). tiktok seems to prefer videos that show your face from the front, by and large, and anything that makes use of its in-app sounds, songs, effects, and features. just a small tip. do some duetting and reacting, people like that. what, you're not on tiktok? *get on tiktok!* it makes me feel old and out-of-touch, too, but you've got to excise that discomfort and get after it. remember, we're committed. **facebook is useful for scheduling events, more useful if you have an older audience**. but even then, i'd use a mailing list. **the nice thing about email is it gets you away from algorithm-driven exposure** — now you can contact people you care about directly. **youtube is a great place to do covers and gather fans from other, extant fanbases.** i know that fans of pinegrove or death cab for cutie will find something to like from our music, for example, so we've spent a lot of time and effort putting together some good quality covers. **i prefer to use reddit in this way** — i spent years learning a lot from this community and it's great to be able to contribute, now. and who knows, maybe you'll gain some new listeners that way, too. you're welcome to make yourself a website, but to be honest i don't think it's all that important anymore.  so you're going to spend your two months gathering an audience on *all* these platforms by posting regularly, engaging with others, and creating high-value content. sneak in some promotional stuff for your music. tiktok seems particularly lawless — just post your song and people will start demanding you release it. this is a game of inches. it takes time. **and don't be afraid to direct your friends and family. learn how to ask, you're going to need to.** otherwise no one will ever even know you released it. but every person you gather becomes a potential vector of new exposure. **ads** as a brief aside, if you have the money, ads can be really useful. the trick is to make it less of an ad and more of a normal post on social media. engagement with videos is much higher. spend some time making a short little video teaser and release video for your music. music videos are even better! try to spend at least $10 a day and use a targeted audience. if you've run ads before, try especially to focus people who have previously engaged with your material. you can have instagram and facebook promote you, you can have youtube screen your videos before other relevant artists. and feel free to get creative with ads in the real world, too. leave random letters inviting people to your show. put up flyers! collaborate with local artists to make cool merchandise and flyers! —     **playlists, playlists, playlists (and blogs, and radio)** **next, get on submithub**. you're going to find yourself a couple blogs — as many as you can — to talk about your release. to be honest, i don't think too many people actively read blogs anymore, but you might gain a little exposure out of it. more importantly, it gives you another measure of legitimacy. people are talking about your music. you're going to share those articles when they're written, and people will be more inclined to check your music out having seen that other people are writing about it. **more importantly, find a couple playlisters to add your song**. with both of these things, it helps be *specific* about your targeting — do a little research. and it helps to have a little money for premium credits, the rate of acceptance is so much higher. but if you *don't* — and that's completely okay — you can earn them by rating others' music on hot or not. and **you should add your music to submithub's hot or not** as well. think of all the other appreciative musicians who are on there listening through hot or not. someone might think your stuff is pretty hot! and then you've got a new fan as well. but playlists. someone commented in the other thread, ""playlists, playlists, playlists."" and if you want to up your monthly listeners and *maybe even gain some fans*, this is the right answer. so ask yourself, who does your music sound like? note, this is not *who do you listen to*, but who do you *sound* like? i love frank ocean and theo katzman, both have influenced my songwriting and sound *immensely*, and i sound nothing like those artists. but fans of pinegrove might find a particular resonance with our music. i'm a new fan of phoebe bridgers (*punisher* is such an amazing sounding album. i love gruska and mills and berg's production, wow) but even before i liked her music i understood that others might find similar qualities. what's the strongest quality of your music? now go forth on spotify and find user-made playlists that have a similar vibe. given them a listen. now's the creepy part — and this process is long and tedious, too. look at the user. do they make playlists under their name? do they have a profile picture? great. spotify pulls those things from facebook. **go find their facebook profile, friend them, and send them a message cold.** be courteous and respectful, be friendly and genuine. let them know you've been digging their playlist. you really like x and y artists, and because of their playlist, you found z artists and you really dig it. you think your song might be a good fit. send them a link and say, if you like it, i'd love it if you could add it to your playlist. this feels slimey and weird and it was one of the earliest forms of exposure we got beyond our immediate social circles. **don't forget about spotify's playlist submission.** as long as your submit two weeks prior to release, you'll be put on release radar, which will let everyone who's listened to your previously know you've got a new song out. from my own experience, release radar can also expose you to new likely fans based on engagement, acting as a little mini discover weekly. **discover weekly is where you want to end up,** because spotify will just continue shipping your song around to new fans as long as there's engagement. these things are both driven by engagement and sharing by users immediately following release, so all that work you put in above is going to be really important! and of course you can submit a song from each release for editorial playlist consideration, too! as always, targeting is key. find the right curated playlist for your specific song, tailor your pitch to that playlist's vibe and content. by the way, i recommend releasing a few singles before the project, and scheduling them to be four weeks apart. this way, spotify will note the consistent influx of new listeners and the momentum you've built up, so it'll start doing some of the work for you. plus, it gives *you* momentum to outside observers. on a sort of related note, reach out to local radio stations! the students who run college stations are eager and have such a passion for music. they are fans just waiting to happen, and you'll find they're often friends waiting to happen as well. it is such a pleasure to sit down and chat with a couple students on the air and it costs you just an hour of your time, an enjoyable one at that. likewise with podcasters! there are so many podcasts these days and i guarantee you know someone that hosts one. reach out!  — **performing live** back before the beginning of the end of the world, we used to play live. **live shows remain the number one way you'll convert a listener to a fan**. try to maximize your exposure by playing venues with good foot traffic — venues with enough of a reputation that they bring their own listener base on a regular basis, potential new fans for you — and by pairing with other bands in the scene. how do you meet other bands? be friendly and sociable, go out to their shows, listen respectfully, talk to them after, buy them a drink. you'll find your scene. their fans will become fans of yours too, and now you two can support one another as acts! build a community, collaborate, experiment, make new great art together. play bomb shows together. and that extends to the people listening as well — put aside whatever discomfort you might feel and play your heart out; invite your audience to come and say hello after the show, to say hello to one another and make new friendships. they'll come to the next show, too, and bring friends. **i want you to play at least two shows, a month apart, in the time leading up to your release.** more if you can travel (e.g., brooklyn and manhattan, separate enough audiences. burlington vt is small enough that you don't want to oversaturate). put together all that work for a big release show when your project drops — collaborate with other bands you've befriended, get a good friday or saturday spot. hell, schedule a tour! we try not to release music without scheduling a little mini-tour for that weekend. **okay, so maybe you don't have a band, or you don't know how to perform. i encourage you to do it anyway.** remember that we're committed here. you can repackage your music — it doesn't have to sound like the record. we recently played a live show online from my apartment. unfortunately it's not really practical for us to play drums and thrashing electric guitars here, so we stripped it down, went acoustic, emphasized the harmonies, i play the piano. a different packaging, but i'm just trying to communicate my vision however i can. i've done videos of myself playing all the instruments. whatever it takes. you can play out live with a laptop as a backing track. you can loop yourself. maybe you're just a bomb musician, so you can just play and that's compelling enough. i'm not that way but i know plenty who are. you can do it! just do it! in my experience, colleges and diy audiences are all really willing and invested fans. colleges will also pay you quite handsomely! also the current backdrop to our musical lives is one of global emergency and live shows aren't really happening right now. there are still shows happening, but it's a bit of a different scene. still, the above applies. find a venue with a built in audience, find some collaborators within your scene, and put something together! maybe you record it with your iphone. you can get a great sound with a phone these days, just spend time getting a good placement. you can do it! just do it! — **putting it all together** before our first release, i spent multiple hours doing this everyday. i would wake up, submit to blogs and playlisters on submithub every four hours, cold message spotify playlisters on my bus ride into work. i put together a show at one of the biggest, highest traffic venues in town with a couple bands from the area — friends i'd made by visiting their shows and being a part of the local scene. we collaborated with a local graphic designer to make these awesome posters.  i drove around an hung them at the local universities and all around town. i scheduled a mini-tour immediately to follow, hitting some of the major cities on the east coast. i invited everyone i knew in each city. i reached out personally! i asked them to bring friends! we filmed parts of our future ad material at these shows with the audience participating. after the show, we packed up quickly and spent time hanging out with friends and listeners, meeting the people with whom our music had resonated. i posted to reddit. some of those posts flopped — which embarrasses me and i'm telling you about it now because that's a reality of what we're doing and we need to accept that. it's slow. but this is a game of inches and you have to keep going, right?

14n50oj,1688142321.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,theusualboysband,I'd like feeback on ways to improve my music release strategy,"My band recently released a song which was the first in a series of upcoming singles that will lead to the release of our first album. I was hoping I could share what we did hear, and get some feedback and tips for future releases. I feel like there have never been so many options for DIY music promotion, but equally there's never been so many middle men and scams. I was basically wondering if there was anything obvious that we missed. 

Paid promotion: We tried not to use this too much because the band is on a budget and we have also had pretty poor results in the past. We dedicated a small amount to playlist pitchers like Submit hub. We achieved a few successes but mostly rejections and a lot of vague often conflicting feedback. I\`ve herd really conflicting things about these services and am interested in hearing how they worked for others. 

Social Media: We produced a lot of tick tocks about the making of the track and how we layered/made each sound. We organsised a mini tour of 5 shows and posted lots of stories/pitcures of us on the road on Instagram. 

Gigs: Like I said we organised 5 dates around the UK, which was a lot of work for us because we are based in Berlin. That felt like a really worthwhile thing to do, we got generally good reactions from crowds (I\`ve also herd that having gigs listed on spotify helps a release, but have no idea if that's true).

Visuals/videos: I was really proud of the single cover, I think it fit our existing work well.(I can't attach a screenshot for some reason but if your interested the song was called 'French Cops' by 'The Usual Boys'). I felt like we would have benefited from a music video but it proved to be impossible on the budget we had. If anyone has any tips for good ideas for a replacement to a traditional music video i'd love to hear them. Even making that stuff on a phone (which we have done) still needs props, an editor, the band to give up at least a weekend, and when everyone is working etc it can be tricky. 

Blogs/Radio: We emailed hundreds of online blogs and radio stations both in germany (in german) and in the UK, America, Australia and odd ones in other countries. 

If you can think of anything we missed, or recomend any services that you have first hand experience with I'd love to hear about them.

ih4p6s,1598467446.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,TheRealKaiLord,PSA: How to tell when Spotify playlists and plays are fake,"We all see shit like this:

""10-15k Guaranteed plays on 12 Playlists for $50 - get your music heard!""

If  you message these people they will send you a bunch of screen shots  from satisfied customers, some will be small time artists, some will be  huge with 200k + followers.

Some might be successful, but most will only have 'bot clout.'

It's really hard to tell when someone's Spotify is just bots if you don't know what to look for - here is what to look for.

Monthly  listeners to total plays - If they have 50k plays on their top song,  and 40k monthly listeners, they recently bought all of those plays.  Because if they really had that kind of listener base MONTHLY, their  total plays would be way higher.

Monthly  listeners to followers - If they have 40k monthly listeners and 300  followers, no one really fucks with them, they paid for the plays.

Where  people are listening - If you see cities like, Los Angeles, Dallas,  Phoenix, Kansas City, Buffalo, London GB, Frankfurt, etc.. these cities  are big data centers where botters can buy a whole bunch of IP addresses  to do fake shit. No one gets above 10% of their listeners from Dallas  unless they are a local act. So getting above 10% from multiple large  cities is simply impossible.

Before  you go checking every spotify playlist promotion to see which ones give  'real' results and which ones are fake... let me spoil it for you. They  are all fake.

Here are the things  that are difficult to do, expensive, still full of bullshit, but can  potentially work (that I'm aware of) submithub, playlistpush and good  old emailing/messaging individual playlist owners

Also,  if you're thinking, meh, I'll do it anyway for the clout, it'll make  other people listen and follow because I'll seem successful. Be the fuck  ware. Because Spotify has come down on bot plays and will again. You do  not want their visible or invisible ban hammer to come down upon you.

i7e20t,1597094856.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,MiffTuck,"Spotify Stream Fraud, and Some of its Implications","This is a bit of a rant about some stuff I've seen over the last couple of days that I think has further implications than what is necessarily evident on the surface.

A bit of background - I'm a guitarist in a UK-based Alt Rock band. We've been out of action for the most part for a good few years whilst writing an album, and having a load of issues along the way that are a whole other story. We're gearing up to release the album and, as such, I've been delving deep into the music marketing world.

One of the big areas I've been looking at has been Spotify playlists (as I'm sure many others are) and, thanks in no small part to this sub, I've found a wealth of information and really expanded my knowledge and understanding of how they work and what makes their algorithms tick.

Now, over the past couple of weeks, I've seen two of my band's contemporaries brag about hitting some big streaming stats (at least from where I'm sitting). The first one was celebrating close to 110k streams on an EP (we'll call this one Band A), and the other one was celebrating hitting 10k streams on a relatively new single (Band B).

To tackle Band A first, I used Spotify for Artists to compare our stats, and came across this absolutely absurd display:

&amp;#x200B;

[Band A Followers](https://preview.redd.it/jken3fenq8g51.png?width=2132&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd16de8c9e0b74bbcd80a6fbf1c6ebe3a77033dd)

In case it isn't blatantly obvious, that massive drop in followers is in April of 2020, where Spotify removed a load of fake users from their system.

Band B's situation was a little more insidious. There was nothing quite so obvious in the Spotify for Artists stats, so I used a free trial of Spot On Track and Chartmetric, and found the reasons for their streams. They were on 2 seemingly massive playlists, but when looking into them a little deeper, each of these playlists (run by the same person) had grown to over 33k followers in little over a month (so almost definitely more bots), and the profile had a link that eventually led to a website where you could buy package deals for ""Spotify Promotion"". On this website, you can choose how many playlists you want to be on, and how many tracks you want to put on them. It looks like they spent 85 Euros in total for their streams.

Now, the obvious thing would be to point out that they won't ultimately achieve anything from this. Sure, they may be able to fool some promoters into giving them better slots than they've necessarily earned, but they certainly won't recuperate the money spent, and their music is quite clearly not really reaching that many people. Their chances of fooling Spotify's algorithm are also probably quite low because, whilst they've got a lot of streams, their save rate is likely to be atrocious, so it's a house of cards. But on the other hand, and in my opinion much worse, it goes to show the lengths that musicians will go to in order to try to manipulate some sort of social proofing.

In both bands' case, they have quite clearly been willing to perpetuate the systematic abuse of the system and of themselves by allowing nefarious operations to profit from their desperation. That may sound hyperbolic, but that's ultimately what it boils down to. I've been, in my head, quite down on things like SubmitHub for allowing yet another part of the music industry that isn't musicians to get money out of us (particularly since I doubt the good faith of a lot of the bloggers on there), but this is on a completely different level.

I also wonder about the implications on musicians' mental health. It's rare a day goes by when you don't see something in the media bemoaning the unrealistic ideals imposed on people by influencers on Instagram, or via celebrities in the media, but I've not heard anything about the inferiority complex that must develop in people about the apparent failure of their music if they don't know that this kind of thing is happening.

What are the most efficient and trusted paid promotion options in your experience?

For example, I hear good things about SubmitHub. I'm definitely going to try it.

Any social media PR firms recommendations? Something that really works on a reasonable budget...

How about FM radio stations? I saw some ads offering song placement on KISS FM (here in the US) for only $25. Seems too good to be true, but maybe someone has tried this?

And also distribution companies offer some promotion for extra $$$. I work with CDBaby for example. Has anyone had positive experience with those promotional tools?

hx1ivt,1595596290.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,MiffTuck,Spotify Pre-Save Campaign - Overview and What I Learned,"Hi all, hope everyone is doing well. Just as a quick introduction and background, I'm a UK-based musician in an alternative rock band. We decided to release a video featuring a song from our upcoming album a couple of months ago with a bunch of friends in lockdown, kind of a DIY thing to try to have a bit of fun. The video itself was really well received, so we thought we'd release it as a ""proper"" single to places like Spotify, iTunes etc.

We use CD Baby as a distributor, so we had a look into the the tools that are available on Show.co, which CD Baby owns (I realise that a lot of people will already know a bunch of this stuff, not trying to teach anyone how to suck eggs, but wanted to ensure full background was there for those unfamiliar!).

We decided on a Spotify pre-save campaign, and recorded a free cover song that we've played at multiple gigs to try to entice people to sign up. Once someone clicked the pre-save, they were automatically redirected to that song on a private SoundCloud link. My theory was that if we get a bunch of people pre-saving the ""new"" single, then it'll have a positive impact on our stats within the first 24 hours, which will hopefully pique the attention of Spotify's algorithms to get us on some playlists. We also ticked the option to have each pre-saver automatically follow the band on Spotify.

We ran a few tests, and drew down the data in a report from the show.co interface. The reports give you the following data on those who sign up:

* Date of signup
* Campaign signed up to
* Spotify User ID
* Name
* Email Address
* Country Code
* City

Certainly more than I was personally expecting. We wanted to keep the campaign short and tight, so we began publicly pushing the pre-save this past Monday (20th July, 2020), with today (Friday 24th July, 2020) being the release date of the single.

Our largest social networks are Facebook (with just over 2,000 fans) and Instagram (with around 3,200 followers). All of these connections are genuine, none bought. I have personally worked very hard on the Instagram account to get the numbers to where they are. We did not pay to promote posts about the campaign, instead attempting to get as much hit from organic reach via strategic sharing and engagement as possible. From this, I was shocked at how much our organic reach (particularly on Instagram) has diminished.

I put out a series of stories (videos with a still image with the cover song playing over them, advising people to go to the link in our bio to pre-save and get the song) on both the band's Instagram account and my own and, after 24 hours, I had 95 views of my story on my personal account (with about 460 followers) and 100 on the band's account (again, with 3,200 followers). To make matters worse, at least a 3rd of that 100 were people who I personally knew, connected to my personal account. To have only 5 more views on an account with over 7 times more followers is absolutely absurd, and a blatant display of how significantly Facebook et al limits your reach without paying.

I'm somewhat of a pragmatist on the matter - I understand that Facebook needs to make money, and that whilst its users create the actual content, they house it, own it, and therefore they're entitled to monetise it. I don't like it, and I certainly think it's been taken to a gross extreme, but they have us over a barrel and we should know better than to focus so much effort on developing a network that we don't own. After all, we're old enough to remember MySpace.

To that end I decided that, on the day of release, I would send a email to all those who completed the pre-save thanking them, and asking them to join our mailing list (unfortunately, GDPR kind of dictated that I couldn't just slot them in, as much as I would like to). I've now done that, and I'm hoping to receive a number of responses.

Now, back to the details of the campaign. We had VERY poor uptake from social media posts, and so set about cajoling people we knew to try to get them to do it. At the close of play, we managed to get a total of 98 unique individuals (not including the band members) to sign up. Interestingly, Show held off on the following until the day of release and, overnight, our follower count shot up from 125 to 209. At the start of the week, it was at 115, to which it had been slowly building for years. Ultimately, it looks like from the 98 pre-savers, it is likely that over 90 of them didn't already follow us (I'm hesitant to give an exact number, as a couple of those extras were people I'd spoken to on Instagram this week). This was a bit of a wake up call that we hadn't done all we could to get our personal acquaintances to follow us, and I would highly recommend anyone reading this to seriously think about talking to people they know!

Alongside the Show campaign, I ran a small SubmitHub campaign to push directly to Spotify playlisters. As seems to be par for the course with an alt-rock band on SubmitHub, I got 1 acceptance out of 17 posts.

Today we have been pushing the single upon its release. I'll update this post after a couple of days to give any relevant updates.

Speaking to a friend of mine from another band, he has used DistroKid as his distributor and mentioned that there are a similar range of tools on there. If anyone has any experience with them, I'd be grateful if you could chime in.

**TL:DR**

* Show.co Spotify pre-save campaigns give a wealth of information about those who sign up.
* Show.co will hold the information of those who have agreed to follow you in one of these campaigns until the day of release, so that all the boost happens at once.
* Organic range on Facebook and Instagram has been absolutely castrated.
* It's very difficult to get people to engage with a campaign unless it's pushed very hard.
* The pre-save campaign will come up with the usual warnings of giving permission to an app to make changes to your Spotify account (who you follow, what's added to your library) - it might seem obvious when you think about it, but I'm certain it turned quite a few people off.
* To use show.co, open it THROUGH your CD Baby Account (it's on the right-hand column on your dashboard under ""Free Marketing Tools"") - if you sign up with a separate account, they'll charge you for the premium version, whereas it's all free via CD Baby.",7,0.68,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/hx1ivt/spotify_presave_campaign_overview_and_what_i/,Spotify Pre-Save Campaign - Overview and What I Learned,spotify pre-save campaign - overview and what i learned,"Hi all, hope everyone is doing well.

hv8zlp,1595344141.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,alexyxray,[Guide] Playlist Pitching: Best Practices &amp; What to Avoid,"*Playlist pitching* is a common buzzword in the streaming age. Playlists have become what big blogs were in the early 2010’s or Radio in the 90’s where a noteworthy placement could mean a huge boost to your career and potential earnings. But not all playlists are made alike and not all playlist pitchers are legitimate.


First let’s clarify the distinction between a User Playlist and an Editorial Playlist. An editorial playlist is curated by someone at a streaming company (for this purpose we’ll include algorithmic playlists which are based on the DSP’s algorithm to recommend you new music, think Discover Weekly on Spotify.) Noteworthy streaming sites like Spotify, Apple Music, Audiomack, Soundcloud all have curated playlists to showcase the standout creators on their platforms; as well as to create a better experience for their users so they don’t have to sift through all the new music that comes out.


Spotify for example, lets you submit directly to their editorial playlists through Spotify For Artists in order to be heard. But they are very unlikely to hear or select your track if you don’t fill out their form with interesting facts and storylines around your new music. Also, you must submit it at least 4-6 weeks ahead of its release date minimum to be considered. Any playlist that is not curated by the streaming service is going to be a User Playlist and as a result is going to take submissions in a different manner, generally through email or DM.

**Playlist Pitchers**

This is where playlist pitchers come in. These are people with partnerships and large developed lists of user playlists with followings that have been accumulated over time. There are legit examples such as Indiemono or SoundPlate that let you submit for playlists for free or next to nothing. Beware though of the dreaded social media curator who takes money for submissions and places you on a bogus playlist that nets you no new listeners or just runs off with your money and starts a new playlist under a new name. If someone hasn’t been referred to you personally then you should be very wary of whether their services are legitimate or not.

**Strategy**

Reaching out to all these playlists on your own can be very time consuming which is why playlist pitching services exist, but sadly the industry hasn’t quite set up enough of an infrastructure to easily discern the scammers from the legit curators. At Zoetic we recommend never paying for a playlist, this will be challenging though as many independent curators or outlets such as Playlist Pusher or Submithub charge for placement or submissions in order to monetize their playlist. This leaves you with a couple routes you can do individually or group together as part of your plan of attack for potential playlisting:


1.   Work with your distributor + Spotify for Artists to submit to editorial playlists 

2.  Work alone or with a team to search &amp; create an email list of reputable user playlist curators 

3.  Share legit playlists with other creatives in exchange for others and combine resources
 
4.  Pay someone with experience reaching out to playlists. Make sure you get a list of who they reach out to and detailed reports of responses, and have a discussion ahead of time about strategy.


If you are dead broke and just want to DIY it completely your best options are 1 and 3. I’d recommend if you’re just starting out to focus on small playlists. Your chances as an unknown artist getting on a major playlist are quite low. Sure small playlists aren’t sexy and you can’t brag about them as much to your friends but here’s a little something that most people don’t realize: if you get dozens and dozens of small playlist adds it’ll help your standing in the Spotify algorithm a lot. Which means you will appear in people’s discover weekly and other algorithmic playlists if you make similar music to the artists they like!


This can be a powerful approach even if you’re only getting on playlists with 100-1000 followers. As long as the playlists are used by actual people and not bots that is. Which sadly is easier said than done, but trust me, it can be done if you do your homework. Finding curators takes time but if you do it in your downtime ahead of when you release music it’ll be a great feeling when you’re all prepared for release week.

What other approaches do you guys take to getting on playlists?

Noteworthy streaming sites like Spotify, Apple Music, Audiomack, Soundcloud all have curated playlists to showcase the standout creators on their platforms; as well as to create a better experience for their users so they don’t have to sift through all the new music that comes out. Spotify for example, lets you submit directly to their editorial playlists through Spotify For Artists in order to be heard. But they are very unlikely to hear or select your track if you don’t fill out their form with interesting facts and storylines around your new music. Also, you must submit it at least 4-6 weeks ahead of its release date minimum to be considered. Any playlist that is not curated by the streaming service is going to be a User Playlist and as a result is going to take submissions in a different manner, generally through email or DM. **Playlist Pitchers** This is where playlist pitchers come in. These are people with partnerships and large developed lists of user playlists with followings that have been accumulated over time. There are legit examples such as Indiemono or SoundPlate that let you submit for playlists for free or next to nothing. Beware though of the dreaded social media curator who takes money for submissions and places you on a bogus playlist that nets you no new listeners or just runs off with your money and starts a new playlist under a new name. If someone hasn’t been referred to you personally then you should be very wary of whether their services are legitimate or not. **Strategy** Reaching out to all these playlists on your own can be very time consuming which is why playlist pitching services exist, but sadly the industry hasn’t quite set up enough of an infrastructure to easily discern the scammers from the legit curators. At Zoetic we recommend never paying for a playlist, this will be challenging though as many independent curators or outlets such as Playlist Pusher or Submithub charge for placement or submissions in order to monetize their playlist. This leaves you with a couple routes you can do individually or group together as part of your plan of attack for potential playlisting 1.   Work with your distributor  Spotify for Artists to submit to editorial playlists  2.  Work alone or with a team to search & create an email list of reputable user playlist curators  3.  Share legit playlists with other creatives in exchange for others and combine resources   4.  Pay someone with experience reaching out to playlists. Make sure you get a list of who they reach out to and detailed reports of responses, and have a discussion ahead of time about strategy. If you are dead broke and just want to DIY it completely your best options are 1 and 3. I’d recommend if you’re just starting out to focus on small playlists. Your chances as an unknown artist getting on a major playlist are quite low. Sure small playlists aren’t sexy and you can’t brag about them as much to your friends but here’s a little something that most people don’t realize if you get dozens and dozens of small playlist adds it’ll help your standing in the Spotify algorithm a lot. Which means you will appear in people’s discover weekly and other algorithmic playlists if you make similar music to the artists they like! This can be a powerful approach even if you’re only getting on playlists with 100-1000 followers. As long as the playlists are used by actual people and not bots that is. Which sadly is easier said than done, but trust me, it can be done if you do your homework. Finding curators takes time but if you do it in your downtime ahead of when you release music it’ll be a great feeling when you’re all prepared for release week.

hqowxt,1594677943.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,TastyCricket,"I was able to trigger Release Radar, Discover weekly, and was added to over 250 playlists in just 3 weeks. Here's the breakdown and how I did it.","I've been a freelance social media advertiser for 4 years now, and decided to apply my process to our new single, and see if my e-commerce advertising success would translate in to success for our new song.  We haven't released music since our EP in 2017, which has just barely broken 5,000 streams total in 3 years.  We released this song on 6/19, here's the breakdown so far:

* $700 spent from a $1,000 total ad budget for the song.
* 9,400 new listeners (15,295% increase)
* 18,000 streams (11,632% increase)
* 125 new followers (257 total to date)
* 257 Playlist adds (4 independent curators from SubmitHub, the rest are personal playlists)
* Triggered Release Radar on 6/26 and removed on 7/10.  11.6k Streams.
* Triggered Discover Weekly today.  Unsure how many new streams this will give us until Spotify updates tomorrow, but there's been anywhere from 10-30 people listening at any given time today.  Seems to be slightly slower than release radar, which averaged 20-30 live listeners on the first day it was added.

**Here's what I did before setting up ads:**

Submitted to Spotify's Editorial Playlists 30 days before release.  I would have submitted sooner but distribution was delayed at the time due to covid.  Still no word back from them on the submission, sounds like we didn't make the cut or they haven't listened yet.

Spent like $25-$30 on Submithub.  Got approved by 4 curators.  Mostly did nothing for us, they had a few thousand followers and the best two playlists got us about 60 streams each for the week we were featured.

**Here's what I did to trigger the algorithms.  I can't go in to the basics of social media advertising right now, so you may need to Google some of these terms.** ***Edit - This is done in Facebook Business Manager.  Do not boost your posts, use the Facebook Ads Manager platform.***

1. I made six separate 15 second videos for the ads.  I chose 15 seconds from the verse, the hook, and the bridge and made an album art video for each.  3 vertical (story ads), 3 square/horizontal (feed ads).  Feed ads need creative copy, story ads don't.

2. I created a link tree for our website so I could capture visitor data on our FB pixel to retarget for our music video/next single before sending them to their streaming platform of choice. If you don't have a website or the means to build a linktree just use HyperURL or something.  Send the people who click on your ads there.

3. Targeting is pretty self explanatory for the most part.  Target your demographic - Age, similar artists, countries.  Do not target wide genres like ""rock"" or ""rap"".  Keep it defined.  ***Pro Tip: Check the box for ""Show only when connected to wifi"" when serving video ads.  This may increase your CPC but helps make sure you are serving your ad to people who can readily listen (Example: at home)***

4. A/B tested audiences and creatives.  Selected the winners, killed the losers.  Avg .10 per click.

5. Created an Ad Campaign using Spotify Ad Studio.  Found an interesting part of our song and recorded myself saying ""Yo this is ""name"" from ""band name"" and you're listening to ""song name"". Tap listen now to hear more!"".  $250 ad budget, targeted similar bands.

That's it!  

Now that we have a substantially higher listener count, we will follow up every month with a new single, remix, etc to keep the algorithm flowing.  We still have $300 left in our allotted ad budget, so we'll probably stick to around $500 - $1,000 per release depending on how they perform organically.

**Final thoughts:**

Despite what I read everywhere, you don't need 20,000 streams to trigger Discover Weekly, we triggered it after 16,000 streams.  It seems to me that if you know what you're doing with social media ads, and have quality music, you shouldn't have a problem triggering the algorithms for yourself.  So I suggest doing a deep dive and learning the platform if you're DIY and are serious about promotion.

We only had 127 followers before Release Radar put our track in to 10,000+ listener's playlists.  That surprised me.

I think if we stick to releasing new music once a month (once every two months max) we should be able to snowball Release Radar and Discover Weekly and continuously trigger them.  Now that we have 10,000 monthly listeners instead of 60, I have a strong feeling the next release will do substantially better (Spotify knows our audience now).

Spotify Ad Studio is a bit more pricey. I'm paying .60 cents per new listener as opposed to .10 cents on social media.  However 47% of the new listeners show intent (save, follow, add to playlist) and they stream the song 10 times on average in the first 48 hours.  There's also no way to track what happens to anyone clicking my ads after they leave my landing page, but Spotify's ad studio gives you an exact breakdown.

It's all about the ALGORITHMS.  Playlists are temporary and don't end with many saves.  Editorial playlists may tell a different story.

**TLDR:**

Learn how to use Facebook and Spotify's ad platforms, boost your stream count early to trigger release radar, supplement with more ads, trigger discover weekly, repeat.

Now that we have 10,000 monthly listeners instead of 60, I have a strong feeling the next release will do substantially better (Spotify knows our audience now). Spotify Ad Studio is a bit more pricey. I'm paying .60 cents per new listener as opposed to .10 cents on social media.  However 47% of the new listeners show intent (save, follow, add to playlist) and they stream the song 10 times on average in the first 48 hours.  There's also no way to track what happens to anyone clicking my ads after they leave my landing page, but Spotify's ad studio gives you an exact breakdown. It's all about the ALGORITHMS.  Playlists are temporary and don't end with many saves.  Editorial playlists may tell a different story. **TLDR** Learn how to use Facebook and Spotify's ad platforms, boost your stream count early to trigger release radar, supplement with more ads, trigger discover weekly, repeat. Let me know if you have any questions!","i've been a freelance social media advertiser for 4 years now, and decided to apply my process to our new single, and see if my e-commerce advertising success would translate in to success for our new song.  we haven't released music since our ep in 2017, which has just barely broken 5,000 streams total in 3 years.  we released this song on 6/19, here's the breakdown so far * $700 spent from a $1,000 total ad budget for the song. * 9,400 new listeners (15,295% increase) * 18,000 streams (11,632% increase) * 125 new followers (257 total to date) * 257 playlist adds (4 independent curators from submithub, the rest are personal playlists) * triggered release radar on 6/26 and removed on 7/10.  11.6k streams. * triggered discover weekly today.  unsure how many new streams this will give us until spotify updates tomorrow, but there's been anywhere from 10-30 people listening at any given time today.  seems to be slightly slower than release radar, which averaged 20-30 live listeners on the first day it was added. **here's what i did before setting up ads** submitted to spotify's editorial playlists 30 days before release.  i would have submitted sooner but distribution was delayed at the time due to covid.  still no word back from them on the submission, sounds like we didn't make the cut or they haven't listened yet. spent like $25-$30 on submithub.  got approved by 4 curators.  mostly did nothing for us, they had a few thousand followers and the best two playlists got us about 60 streams each for the week we were featured. **here's what i did to trigger the algorithms.  i can't go in to the basics of social media advertising right now, so you may need to google some of these terms.** ***edit - this is done in facebook business manager.  do not boost your posts, use the facebook ads manager platform.*** 1. i made six separate 15 second videos for the ads.  i chose 15 seconds from the verse, the hook, and the bridge and made an album art video for each.  3 vertical (story ads), 3 square/horizontal (feed ads).  feed ads need creative copy, story ads don't. 2. i created a link tree for our website so i could capture visitor data on our fb pixel to retarget for our music video/next single before sending them to their streaming platform of choice. if you don't have a website or the means to build a linktree just use hyperurl or something.  send the people who click on your ads there. 3. targeting is pretty self explanatory for the most part.  target your demographic - age, similar artists, countries.  do not target wide genres like ""rock"" or ""rap"".  keep it defined.  ***pro tip check the box for ""show only when connected to wifi"" when serving video ads.  this may increase your cpc but helps make sure you are serving your ad to people who can readily listen (example at home)*** 4. a/b tested audiences and creatives.  selected the winners, killed the losers.  avg .10 per click. 5. created an ad campaign using spotify ad studio.  found an interesting part of our song and recorded myself saying ""yo this is ""name"" from ""band name"" and you're listening to ""song name"". tap listen now to hear more!"".  $250 ad budget, targeted similar bands. that's it!   now that we have a substantially higher listener count, we will follow up every month with a new single, remix, etc to keep the algorithm flowing.  we still have $300 left in our allotted ad budget, so we'll probably stick to around $500 - $1,000 per release depending on how they perform organically. **final thoughts** despite what i read everywhere, you don't need 20,000 streams to trigger discover weekly, we triggered it after 16,000 streams.  it seems to me that if you know what you're doing with social media ads, and have quality music, you shouldn't have a problem triggering the algorithms for yourself.  so i suggest doing a deep dive and learning the platform if you're diy and are serious about promotion. we only had 127 followers before release radar put our track in to 10,000 listener's playlists.  that surprised me. i think if we stick to releasing new music once a month (once every two months max) we should be able to snowball release radar and discover weekly and continuously trigger them.  now that we have 10,000 monthly listeners instead of 60, i have a strong feeling the next release will do substantially better (spotify knows our audience now). spotify ad studio is a bit more pricey. i'm paying .60 cents per new listener as opposed to .10 cents on social media.  however 47% of the new listeners show intent (save, follow, add to playlist) and they stream the song 10 times on average in the first 48 hours.  there's also no way to track what happens to anyone clicking my ads after they leave my landing page, but spotify's ad studio gives you an exact breakdown. it's all about the algorithms.  playlists are temporary and don't end with many saves.  editorial playlists may tell a different story. **tldr** learn how to use facebook and spotify's ad platforms, boost your stream count early to trigger release radar, supplement with more ads, trigger discover weekly, repeat. let me know if you have any questions!",28,894

I have pre-debut releases out. I mainly do pop and electronic music.

I want to tell everyone that is contributing to this subreddit to keep up the good work, there is few places on the internet where you find such genuine and nice people talking about music.

***About Me***

I'm 27 and been working with music for the past 10 years, I've racked up around 150 million streams world wide over the common platforms and had some tracks on the top 50 Charts in a few countries.

I wrote my first post here about 2 months ago talking about my experience and ways of how I've made my music heard around the world. I got so many good questions and they still popping up in my DM now and then and im just glad i can help out!

I wanted to share what I've been through during my 10 years in the industry, Starting as a bedroom producer, to getting signed to a major label, into going back to now going independent and promoting and managing my own projects again, How this has impacted me, what I've learned along the way and what i can recommend to do or not.

Im gonna try to keep this relatively short and focus on the things that can actually help you in your own work and projects, but without making it too plain.

# Music background in music

So I started making music when i was 17 (27 today), Had pretty much no idea what i was doing songwriting wise, but my mother made me play piano in 8 years up to that point so i had some knowledge in how chords and notes worked.

It took me 4 years until i got to release my first single, the song was a melbourne bounce track that me and 2 friends completed in about 5 hours and we pretty much shoved it out on Spotify and wrote to all our friends on Facebook to share it. It gained some interest and streams and had around 100k streams after a month.

At the time we where pretty hyped over the results and we started to get some interest from labels via email, really small ones. We booked a meeting with one of them, and on the way over we agreed that we should reach out to the big ones too, got nothing to lose right? Stalked up a Phone number to an A&amp;R of a major label and called him from the car and said that we had a track we wanted him to hear.

His Response was something like :

""No it dont work that way, that need to be planned in weeks in advance"".

We told him that we wanted to mail it over anyway and asked for his email adress that he gave out, probably to get rid of us, and hung up the call. 10 minutes later we got a callback from him saying that he wanted to have a meeting and discuss a deal (Guess he liked the track). We planned it in after the first meeting with the small label and went on ahead.

The first meeting Isnt anything special, the guy pretty much tells us that he could work with us and maybe get us signed to another label later. Didnt feel the vibe here but told him that we should get back to him after the other meeting we had planned.

At The Major Labels it was pretty badass, big offices, looked professional, went in to a room and the A&amp;R was very professional and friendly, we decided to pretty much agree on the terms he laid up on the table, unexperienced as we where, (License deal, 70 % For the label, 30% for us) and went home. He actually did alot of work on the track, put it in some huge playlists and the track got way more attention than before (Currently around 10 million streams).

After this we Released a collab with a major artist which came to be my biggest release till today (Around 65 million streams, top 50 in 3 countries). This release was pretty much how people think a major label works since the other artist was so established. A whole team of people working it, Analytics, graphic designers, and a huge budget.

After this it all went south, for every release we did,  The Label was less and less interested in working with it. We also got our A&amp;R Changed since the previous one quit working for there and the new one wasnt nearly as interested in working the project.  We also got a new contract for the project with reasoning from them that they wont be able to make a profit if they dont lower our %, which turned into an 80/20 contract for us if we wanted to stay with them.

Our latest releases is laying on around 1 million streams in average which isnt nearly enough to make the money required, and here is why:

1 million streams = \~$5000 (Counted high)

20% of $5000 = $1000

We are 3 in that group, which means that generates \~$333 Each for every release.

Also, what many dont know, is that any expense that a label puts out on your project is recoupable, which means that if they spend $1000 On ads for a single, you wont get paid from the track until your share has generated those $1000. After that you get paid.

This pretty much means that any promotion they do, that cost money, will be taken from your pocket.  So You're Paying a company a huge amount of your % to work your project, but you are also paying for the money they put in. This becomes a bad circle where you get paid very little for the time you put in unless the label really prioritize you, which you have no control over.

Ofcourse they have huge channels that will give you exposure that dont cost money, such as playlists &amp;  social media, but yet , i needed 5x the streams than if i wasnt signed to make the same.

# Going Independent again

This is when i started to calculate things and thinking about if i really need the label to do those things for me, what if i learned to run the ads myself? Started pitching playlists myself? And started building my own brand where i can effectively chose the most profitable ways of promoting.

I got together with 2 other musicians i know, one songwriter/vocalist and one sound engeneer/producer where i put out the idea of going independent which they liked. I was studying marketing and music promotion in every way possible around the web for 6 months to really get the hang of how to get the right exposure for our music longterm by ourselves and then we put out our first release.

# Some good to know's

So, Spotify favours tracks that generates good data, its not all about streaming numbers. I think the focus should be changed from looking at the amount of streams to things as Save rate, User Playlist adds, Skip rate, Following and Listeners.

They also want users to stay on the platform as long as possible, so get your Artist page professional! Add a biography, update your photos, Use the artist pick with a playlist or your latest release. It all matters.

**What you want to achive for the algoritm to favour you**

A good save rate (I Read somewhere that a good goal is 10% of the streams, guess its just an opinion though)

User Playlist adds

Conversion Rate (How many of your listeners starts to follow you)

Listener vs Streams (If you have as many listeners as streams, that means noone repeats your song which is not favourable. Spotify wants people to repeat the song to show that they like it.)

Spotify Followers (Every follower gets your new releases in their release radar. 500 followers = 500 release radar ads, free exposure)

**What you want to avoid**

High Skiprate (If people skips your song that means they dont like it. This rate can be reduced by removing long intros or outros and to focus on keeping a good energy through the track. Even if its a ballad or a dance track. You also only get paid if the user streams it for atleast 30 seconds)

Low Save Rate (Example: If you only go for playlist pitching, your save rate is gonna drop dramaticly. Thats because of how a listener consumes music in a playlist. Maybe they're out running and they put a playlist on with running music, very few will stop what they are doing to check what song is playing to add it to their playlist or follow the artist)

People deleting you from their Playlist (Hard to control, just stay professional so that people dont start to dislike you on social media and stuff)

# My methods of Promotion

***Presave***

So firstly I Ran a pre-save campaign, for those who dont know, a pre-save gives a user the opportunity to save the track in advance, when the song releases everyone who has pre-saved will: Follow the artist &amp; like the Song. This gives a way to start promoting the song and getting good engagement for the track even before the song is released.

When it comes to how to get people to pre-save it all about being creative.

Ofcourse i wrote to all of my friends and family to click the link and to share the link on their social media. I also contacted a few influencers and chose to go through with the ones where i believed would reach the biggest audience for the smallest cost. I spent about $50 on the pre-save campaign and had about 300 Pre-saves on the track

***Ads:***

I ran ads through Snapchat &amp; Instagram Story, the Snapchat ads has performed best so far. The ad is a video with a short clip from the most interesting part of the song with some text about that the music is out. I target my ads to people who like artists in the same genre or music festivals that play that kind of music.

What i have been doing differently than before is that the location the ad link sends you is to my Spotify PROFILE, not to the Spotify track.

There is 2 reasons for this:

When someone clicks your link and gets sent directly to the track, they might play it for 15 seconds then leave and go back to what they where doing. They might have clicked the link by accident or just had a mild interest in what they saw. What this does it that it increases your Skiprate. You might get more streams by sending people to your track, but the quality is lower.

The second reason i send users to the artist page is because of the following. The follow button only shows when you browse an artist page, not when you browse a track. So when you click the link and get directly to the artist page you get presented the follow button and the user get the whole picture of the artist. They need to make a commitment to press play on your music and if that commitment exists, there is a much higher chance they will listen to the whole track and save the track.

***Other Streaming Platforms:***

So, my focus is towards Spotify, but we want high quality listeners on Spotify. Thats why i have been putting in a good amount of work to get the track heard on other platforms, such as Soundcloud &amp; Youtube.

If someone hears your track on SC or YT and they really like it, there is a good chance that they want to add it on their Spotify too. They will look for links in the descriptions where it is openly presented and after that get to the Spotify Profile. Noone that dosnt like the song will look for those links, which means that almost every user that comes from other platforms probably likes the track and wants to save it.

In this project we release our music Copyright free. So i emailed around 100 Youtube Channels that upload copyright free music and asked if they wanted to upload the track. I got answers from around 20 of them that went ahead and uploaded. This spread across Youtube and last time i checked there was around 3000 videos that used the track in their own uploads as background music/streaming music/intros etc. The same goes here, if one of their viewers hears the track and like it, they look it up on Spotify which becomes a quality listener.

&amp;#x200B;

***Playlist Pitching***

Even though i wrote earlier that playlists can hurt your save rate, its not a bad thing. You shoulnt just Only Focus on playlists. I created my own spreadsheet of playlist currators before we released our first track that had about 400 contacts and sent out a pitch to them. Got loads of answers, many that asked for payment to place the song which i ignored and removed from my list, but there was also some that either added the track or said that the song dont fit them but to come back with more material. Those are the valuable ones, ofcourse i answered all of them with a thank you, tagged their social media and posted about their playlist on Instagram/facebook to show my help in return because i want to keep a good relationship and be able to send more tracks to them.

I also tried out submithub, i spend about $80 on it, i didnt get a single approval so i wont do that again.

I submitted to websites that provies playlist submissions through the web. Heres a list:

IndieMono

Soundplate

WorkHardPlaylistHard

ArtistintelligenceAgency

DailyPlaylist

LoveofBands

Simon Field

MySphera

Kolibri Music

Tunemunk

Alexrainbirdmusic

&amp;#x200B;

I got added to 5 playlists from those.

&amp;#x200B;

***Social Media***

We keep our Social Medias up to date, we dont only post promotional posts about our music and releases. Here is where we give the followers the value that they want, we include working progress, pictures of ourselves, stories of our vocalists singing etc. We also work hard to have a good relationship with our followers and other users, we answer to comments, writes on other peoples music posts/videos and just show ourselves as much as possible. The social Medias are just as important as Spotify, because its another way to get yourself seen and heard.

# Results

We released our first single in May that has gained about 119k streams, a remix of that that is around 20k streams. The remix has been picked up by discover weekly and the number from it is growing slowly (Started from 40/day and is now on around 75/day) We've gathered around 900 followers on Spotify and around 600 on Instagram, gotten 6 offers from labels and a few collab requests from other artists that want do work together.

The result is in my opinion good. Even though I've put in extremely many work hours, learning and executing all the things that I've felt was necessary the process has been really fun. If you're like me and get a kick out of seeing numbers and graphs grow, it's way more interesting to do the work yourself than let a label do most of it.

I do have a positive view on the project since i believe it will grow exponentially, we got 4 more tracks ready for release with the first one coming out now on July 17 and plan to release them with around 45 days between each other to keep the momentum going and hopefully get good enough engagement to be picked up by discover weekly and maybe Spotify Editorial Playlists sometime.

Only time will tell!

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this can help someone with their own music or choices in the industry and if there is any questions I'll try to answer them as good as i can

also got our a&r changed since the previous one quit working for there and the new one wasnt nearly as interested in working the project.  we also got a new contract for the project with reasoning from them that they wont be able to make a profit if they dont lower our %, which turned into an 80/20 contract for us if we wanted to stay with them. our latest releases is laying on around 1 million streams in average which isnt nearly enough to make the money required, and here is why 1 million streams = \~$5000 (counted high) 20% of $5000 = $1000 we are 3 in that group, which means that generates \~$333 each for every release. also, what many dont know, is that any expense that a label puts out on your project is recoupable, which means that if they spend $1000 on ads for a single, you wont get paid from the track until your share has generated those $1000. after that you get paid. this pretty much means that any promotion they do, that cost money, will be taken from your pocket.  so you're paying a company a huge amount of your % to work your project, but you are also paying for the money they put in. this becomes a bad circle where you get paid very little for the time you put in unless the label really prioritize you, which you have no control over. ofcourse they have huge channels that will give you exposure that dont cost money, such as playlists &  social media, but yet , i needed 5x the streams than if i wasnt signed to make the same.  going independent again this is when i started to calculate things and thinking about if i really need the label to do those things for me, what if i learned to run the ads myself? started pitching playlists myself? and started building my own brand where i can effectively chose the most profitable ways of promoting. i got together with 2 other musicians i know, one songwriter/vocalist and one sound engeneer/producer where i put out the idea of going independent which they liked. i was studying marketing and music promotion in every way possible around the web for 6 months to really get the hang of how to get the right exposure for our music longterm by ourselves and then we put out our first release.  some good to know's so, spotify favours tracks that generates good data, its not all about streaming numbers. i think the focus should be changed from looking at the amount of streams to things as save rate, user playlist adds, skip rate, following and listeners. they also want users to stay on the platform as long as possible, so get your artist page professional! add a biography, update your photos, use the artist pick with a playlist or your latest release. it all matters. **what you want to achive for the algoritm to favour you** a good save rate (i read somewhere that a good goal is 10% of the streams, guess its just an opinion though) user playlist adds conversion rate (how many of your listeners starts to follow you) listener vs streams (if you have as many listeners as streams, that means noone repeats your song which is not favourable. spotify wants people to repeat the song to show that they like it.) spotify followers (every follower gets your new releases in their release radar. 500 followers = 500 release radar ads, free exposure) **what you want to avoid** high skiprate (if people skips your song that means they dont like it. this rate can be reduced by removing long intros or outros and to focus on keeping a good energy through the track. even if its a ballad or a dance track. you also only get paid if the user streams it for atleast 30 seconds) low save rate (example if you only go for playlist pitching, your save rate is gonna drop dramaticly. thats because of how a listener consumes music in a playlist. maybe they're out running and they put a playlist on with running music, very few will stop what they are doing to check what song is playing to add it to their playlist or follow the artist) people deleting you from their playlist (hard to control, just stay professional so that people dont start to dislike you on social media and stuff) &x200b; there is some more info in my previous post about this, you can check it out here   my methods of promotion ***presave*** so firstly i ran a pre-save campaign, for those who dont know, a pre-save gives a user the opportunity to save the track in advance, when the song releases everyone who has pre-saved will follow the artist & like the song. this gives a way to start promoting the song and getting good engagement for the track even before the song is released. when it comes to how to get people to pre-save it all about being creative. ofcourse i wrote to all of my friends and family to click the link and to share the link on their social media. i also contacted a few influencers and chose to go through with the ones where i believed would reach the biggest audience for the smallest cost. i spent about $50 on the pre-save campaign and had about 300 pre-saves on the track ***ads*** i ran ads through snapchat & instagram story, the snapchat ads has performed best so far. the ad is a video with a short clip from the most interesting part of the song with some text about that the music is out. i target my ads to people who like artists in the same genre or music festivals that play that kind of music. what i have been doing differently than before is that the location the ad link sends you is to my spotify profile, not to the spotify track. there is 2 reasons for this when someone clicks your link and gets sent directly to the track, they might play it for 15 seconds then leave and go back to what they where doing. they might have clicked the link by accident or just had a mild interest in what they saw. what this does it that it increases your skiprate. you might get more streams by sending people to your track, but the quality is lower. the second reason i send users to the artist page is because of the following. the follow button only shows when you browse an artist page, not when you browse a track. so when you click the link and get directly to the artist page you get presented the follow button and the user get the whole picture of the artist. they need to make a commitment to press play on your music and if that commitment exists, there is a much higher chance they will listen to the whole track and save the track. ***other streaming platforms*** so, my focus is towards spotify, but we want high quality listeners on spotify. thats why i have been putting in a good amount of work to get the track heard on other platforms, such as soundcloud & youtube. if someone hears your track on sc or yt and they really like it, there is a good chance that they want to add it on their spotify too. they will look for links in the descriptions where it is openly presented and after that get to the spotify profile. noone that dosnt like the song will look for those links, which means that almost every user that comes from other platforms probably likes the track and wants to save it. in this project we release our music copyright free. so i emailed around 100 youtube channels that upload copyright free music and asked if they wanted to upload the track. i got answers from around 20 of them that went ahead and uploaded. this spread across youtube and last time i checked there was around 3000 videos that used the track in their own uploads as background music/streaming music/intros etc. the same goes here, if one of their viewers hears the track and like it, they look it up on spotify which becomes a quality listener. &x200b; ***playlist pitching*** even though i wrote earlier that playlists can hurt your save rate, its not a bad thing. you shoulnt just only focus on playlists. i created my own spreadsheet of playlist currators before we released our first track that had about 400 contacts and sent out a pitch to them. got loads of answers, many that asked for payment to place the song which i ignored and removed from my list, but there was also some that either added the track or said that the song dont fit them but to come back with more material. those are the valuable ones, ofcourse i answered all of them with a thank you, tagged their social media and posted about their playlist on instagram/facebook to show my help in return because i want to keep a good relationship and be able to send more tracks to them. i also tried out submithub, i spend about $80 on it, i didnt get a single approval so i wont do that again. i submitted to websites that provies playlist submissions through the web. heres a list indiemono soundplate workhardplaylisthard artistintelligenceagency dailyplaylist loveofbands simon field mysphera kolibri music tunemunk alexrainbirdmusic &x200b; i got added to 5 playlists from those. &x200b; ***social media*** we keep our social medias up to date, we dont only post promotional posts about our music and releases. here is where we give the followers the value that they want, we include working progress, pictures of ourselves, stories of our vocalists singing etc. we also work hard to have a good relationship with our followers and other users, we answer to comments, writes on other peoples music posts/videos and just show ourselves as much as possible. the social medias are just as important as spotify, because its another way to get yourself seen and heard.  results we released our first single in may that has gained about 119k streams, a remix of that that is around 20k streams. the remix has been picked up by discover weekly and the number from it is growing slowly (started from 40/day and is now on around 75/day) we've gathered around 900 followers on spotify and around 600 on instagram, gotten 6 offers from labels and a few collab requests from other artists that want do work together. the result is in my opinion good. even though i've put in extremely many work hours, learning and executing all the things that i've felt was necessary the process has been really fun. if you're like me and get a kick out of seeing numbers and graphs grow, it's way more interesting to do the work yourself than let a label do most of it. i do have a positive view on the project since i believe it will grow exponentially, we got 4 more tracks ready for release with the first one coming out now on july 17 and plan to release them with around 45 days between each other to keep the momentum going and hopefully get good enough engagement to be picked up by discover weekly and maybe spotify editorial playlists sometime. only time will tell! &x200b; i hope this can help someone with their own music or choices in the industry and if there is any questions i'll try to answer them as good as i can much love to everyone here in watmm!",14,2720

Hi, i’m here to share my experience on SubmitHub, hoping to be usefull for someone.

I’ve  used this service for a couple of song, and since it’s a long post, i  want to start with the most faq i’ve read on reddit about this.

Yes  this website is legit, and it’s a great idea, should you use it? It’s  all about lucky, i probably won’t use it anymore, not because of the  service, that does what it should and the founder it’s always on the  chat to help and talk with people, but because curators, at least in my  experience, they are not open minded to listen something that try to  bring something different on the scene, there is a reason why we are  artists and not someone who clean a window, if i wanted to copy somone  else i whould chose another job.

With  the premium credits you will receive the feedback from curators, but  are not really helpfull, because someone could say your vocal is awesome  but the instrumental suck, and another one the opposite. My last song  was declined for sharing by all curators i’ve submitted, i want to copy  here all the feedback, because i think it worth reading to have an idea,  ofc i wont write who they are, but just the feedback.

**Feadback (all declined)**

Great  tune, loved the vocal as well as the bubbling house vibes on the  baseline. The drop is quite fresh and well produced and overall the  track sounds really fresh. Unfortunately, it's a bit too relaxing and  deep for us, sorry

""Fearless""  offers a very accessible and energetic Progressive House sound, the  melodic arrangements are impressive and super uplifting, the track has a  great deep invigorating energy and nice enigmatic ambiance, however,  although it is a quality production, it unfortunately wasn't quite  compelling enough for a blog feature, I'm sorry

Thanks  for submitting! I like the very nostalgic and sweet melodies of the  song but the drop is not as energetic as I expected, the kick is a  little too thin and flat and the bass not deep.

Hey  there, Cool instrumental and very vibey sound design &amp; chords !  We're not caught by the vocals on this one though. Thanks for sending

Good  production enjoyable beat and vocal arrangements unfortunately not  convinced on the melody so let's try your next thanks for submitting

Hey,  the intro and the vocals soudns really great of course but actually  dont really like the beat drop. Next time you should work a bit more on  it in my opinion.

Hey there, thanks for the submission. Instrumental is fine but vocal is not what we are looking for qualitywise. Sorry!

thanks  for submitting Fearless. Been so pumped with teh vocal, sadly the drop  turned out a bit too different than we expected. Hoped for a big  epxlisive one! :(

Hey, good track,  good production. I like the instrumental. Unfortunately I am not a fan  of the vocals. They sound too standard to me. Unfortunately they don't  kick me. Therefore, in this case I must decline. Nevertheless I wish you  a lot of success with this song! I'm sure it will find its fans. Thanks  for sending!

Nice instrumental. We don't feel the vocals enough. Thanks for submitting it to us

This  started of pretty good, really nice pads and great pluck. The vocal was  ok, it didnt sound great at times which didnt really let me enjoy the  song much. The production was quite clean but I didn't really enjoy the  drop much - it was missing alot of elements to keep it interesting.  Great concept though just needs a bit more work - Thanks for sending

the  song sounded quite good. This was definitely some high quality  production - The mix was dope and the elements used were good. The  melodies were catchy! Good job! Sadly here, i wasn't hooked by the vocal  topline (lyrics and melodies). Indeed, i felt like it was a bit  repetitive and linear for my personal tastes. I didn't feel like it was  professional enough.. :/ I know most people will love the song, but it  didn't convince me enough for me to support in my list this time. But  thank you for your submission. Have a good day and stay safe!

Even  though the song is not suitable for my playlist, cause I find it too  chill and not that commercial, I want to highlight the originality of  the instrumental

Hey, the mix and  master sounds really clean but actually dont really like the break  melody. Next time you should work more on it.

Hey  Frankie, thanks for reaching out. The idea is cool and it has  potential, but I'm afraid the mixing quality and the sound desing here  still sounds quite weak and messy, there's no contrast betweent the  different sections of the song.. not really meeting our quality  standards for a feature this time, I'm sorry. Wish you good luck with  your song release!

It's a  wonderful summer melody and music production is well done, but we  expected more developed progression..Anyway, keep creating

The  energy in the song is nice here. So not bad. But also a bit too beat  driven I would say as I was missing a more melodic production here to  make the song stand out enough for me. So not all the way this time.

I appreciate the songwriting, but I wasn't into the final mix of Fearless nor the vocal performance.

what we didn't enjoy here is unoriginal melodies, keep on, your voice is amazing

not a fan of the drop here but just my taste

Thanks  for submitting but I'm going to pass. The song has solid production  that sets a nice tone but vocally I feel the song could be stronger to  my personal ear. Best of luck to you

Congrats  on the single. Lovely dance. That ending wasn't what the beginning of  the song was teasing. Was hoping for a huge ending. But that's just us  FT. Nice house, indeed. Keep on kickin' as you do. Sorry couldn't pull  the trigger. Enjoy the accolades.

Cool  vibe on the soundscape and vocals. There's definitely some talent  there. For me, I would like to hear a more defining hook that we can  sink our teeth into overall though. This one felt a little too one note  for placement.

Super impressive  but sadly did get a bit repetitive for me. Surely might circle back  around to this one though after giving it some time and will reach  out..!

Production is really dope  here. Vocals need a little development, sonically fell a little short  for us. Keep it up though, production is dope

The intro got me hooked! The drop was however very underwhelming. I'd try adding a lead to it so it can shine!

Good  production. The track feels, however, a little on the familiar side and  might benefit from adding fresher sound elements, twists and turns to  really take off and stand out that much more in this genre.

Great  tune, loved the vocal as well as the bubbling house vibes on the  baseline. The drop is quite fresh and well produced and overall the  track sounds really fresh. Unfortunately, it's a bit too relaxing and  deep for us, sorry

The highs of  this song sound a little bit strange. Would work on that to get a proper  final track because the melody has a really good potential!

La chanson sonne très ordinaire, standard selon nous, peut être une autre

I  struggled a bit to stay dialed in on the vocals enough to connect  lyrically. The build and production are there, but I never found my one  moment to land with this one.

**My final thought**

As  you can see the most complain is the drop that isn’t huge, and surprise  surprise, this is what i wanted, i don’t wanna copy niky romero or  other artists, i wanna share my personal vibes, and when i listen a song  i’m looking for a contact with the artist, trying to feel what he felt,  i'm not trying to think about what he was supposed to do, the song is  his world and if he made a different choice there is a reason, and as  listener i try to understand it.

Music  is art, or it should be, i just immagine someone like Picasso in our  era where a curators will write “Sorry but i’m not  expected something  less messy, try to paint like Raffaello”

I can’t post links, but if someone is curious to listen the song send me a DM i will drop you the link

I’m also running a campaign on playlistpush, if this topic will reach some interest i will post my thought on that service too",5,0.7,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicproduction/comments/hha6qo/my_submithub_experience/,My submithub experience,my submithub experience,"  Hi, i’m here to share my experience on SubmitHub, hoping to be usefull for someone.

Yes this website is legit, and it’s a great idea, should you use it? It’s all about lucky, i probably won’t use it anymore, not because of the service, that does what it should and the founder it’s always on the chat to help and talk with people, but because curators, at least in my experience, they are not open minded to listen something that try to bring something different on the scene, there is a reason why we are artists and not someone who clean a window, if i wanted to copy somone else i whould chose another job.

With the premium credits you will receive the feedback from curators, but are not really helpfull, because someone could say your vocal is awesome but the instrumental suck, and another one the opposite. My last song was declined for sharing by all curators i’ve submitted, i want to copy here all the feedback, because i think it worth reading to have an idea, ofc i wont write who they are, but just the feedback.

**Feadback (all declined)**

Great tune, loved the vocal as well as the bubbling house vibes on the baseline. The drop is quite fresh and well produced and overall the track sounds really fresh. Unfortunately, it's a bit too relaxing and deep for us, sorry  

""Fearless"" offers a very accessible and energetic Progressive House sound, the melodic arrangements are impressive and super uplifting, the track has a great deep invigorating energy and nice enigmatic ambiance, however, although it is a quality production, it unfortunately wasn't quite compelling enough for a blog feature, I'm sorry  

Thanks for submitting! I like the very nostalgic and sweet melodies of the song but the drop is not as energetic as I expected, the kick is a little too thin and flat and the bass not deep.  

Hey there, Cool instrumental and very vibey sound design &amp; chords ! We're not caught by the vocals on this one though. Thanks for sending  

Good production enjoyable beat and vocal arrangements unfortunately not convinced on the melody so let's try your next thanks for submitting  

Hey, the intro and the vocals soudns really great of course but actually dont really like the beat drop. Next time you should work a bit more on it in my opinion.  

Hey there, thanks for the submission. Instrumental is fine but vocal is not what we are looking for qualitywise. Sorry!  

thanks for submitting Fearless. Been so pumped with teh vocal, sadly the drop turned out a bit too different than we expected. Hoped for a big epxlisive one! :(

Hey, the mix and master sounds really clean but actually dont really like the break melody. Next time you should work more on it.  

Hey Frankie, thanks for reaching out. The idea is cool and it has potential, but I'm afraid the mixing quality and the sound desing here still sounds quite weak and messy, there's no contrast betweent the different sections of the song.. not really meeting our quality standards for a feature this time, I'm sorry.

It's a wonderful summer melody and music production is well done, but we expected more developed progression..Anyway, keep creating  

The energy in the song is nice here. So not bad. But also a bit too beat driven I would say as I was missing a more melodic production here to make the song stand out enough for me. So not all the way this time.  

I appreciate the songwriting, but I wasn't into the final mix of Fearless nor the vocal performance.

not a fan of the drop here but just my taste

La chanson sonne très ordinaire, standard selon nous, peut être une autre  

I struggled a bit to stay dialed in on the vocals enough to connect lyrically. The build and production are there, but I never found my one moment to land with this one.  

**My final thought**

As you can see the most complain is the drop that isn’t huge, and surprise surprise, this is what i wanted, i don’t wanna copy niky romero or other artists, i wanna share my personal vibes, and when i listen a song i’m looking for a contact with the artist, trying to feel what he felt, i'm not trying to think about what he was supposed to do, the song is his world and if he made a different choice there is a reason, and as listener i try to understand it.

  it's a wonderful summer melody and music production is well done, but we expected more developed progression..anyway, keep creating   the energy in the song is nice here. so not bad. but also a bit too beat driven i would say as i was missing a more melodic production here to make the song stand out enough for me. so not all the way this time.   i appreciate the songwriting, but i wasn't into the final mix of fearless nor the vocal performance.   what we didn't enjoy here is unoriginal melodies, keep on, your voice is amazing   not a fan of the drop here but just my taste   thanks for submitting but i'm going to pass. the song has solid production that sets a nice tone but vocally i feel the song could be stronger to my personal ear. best of luck to you   congrats on the single. lovely dance. that ending wasn't what the beginning of the song was teasing. was hoping for a huge ending. but that's just us ft. nice house, indeed. keep on kickin' as you do. sorry couldn't pull the trigger. enjoy the accolades.   cool vibe on the soundscape and vocals. there's definitely some talent there. for me, i would like to hear a more defining hook that we can sink our teeth into overall though. this one felt a little too one note for placement.   super impressive but sadly did get a bit repetitive for me. surely might circle back around to this one though after giving it some time and will reach out..!   production is really dope here. vocals need a little development, sonically fell a little short for us. keep it up though, production is dope   the intro got me hooked! the drop was however very underwhelming. i'd try adding a lead to it so it can shine!   good production. the track feels, however, a little on the familiar side and might benefit from adding fresher sound elements, twists and turns to really take off and stand out that much more in this genre.   great tune, loved the vocal as well as the bubbling house vibes on the baseline. the drop is quite fresh and well produced and overall the track sounds really fresh. unfortunately, it's a bit too relaxing and deep for us, sorry   the highs of this song sound a little bit strange. would work on that to get a proper final track because the melody has a really good potential!   la chanson sonne très ordinaire, standard selon nous, peut être une autre   i struggled a bit to stay dialed in on the vocals enough to connect lyrically. the build and production are there, but i never found my one moment to land with this one.   **my final thought** as you can see the most complain is the drop that isn’t huge, and surprise surprise, this is what i wanted, i don’t wanna copy niky romero or other artists, i wanna share my personal vibes, and when i listen a song i’m looking for a contact with the artist, trying to feel what he felt, i'm not trying to think about what he was supposed to do, the song is his world and if he made a different choice there is a reason, and as listener i try to understand it.   music is art, or it should be, i just immagine someone like picasso in our era where a curators will write “sorry but i’m not  expected something less messy, try to paint like raffaello” i can’t post links, but if someone is curious to listen the song send me a dm i will drop you the link i’m also running a campaign on playlistpush, if this topic will reach some interest i will post my thought on that service too",3,1460
hfojvp,1593100558.0,TechnoProduction,-endjamin-,I've got a few more questions about releasing music,"I made a [thread about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TechnoProduction/comments/gorucq/finished_up_an_epnow_what/) somewhat recently and got some good feedback, but I still have a few questions. Since that thread, I have sent my (self mastered) EP to a few labels. I haven't heard anything and it doesn't look like anyone even listened to it. I guess I should send it to more labels, which brings me to my first question: 

How do you create a list of labels to send things to? Of course, there are a few big labels everyone knows (Suara, Afterlife, Tresor, etc) but for a first release it's probably better to target smaller labels. But I don't know the names of these labels or what their deal is! Is there a list I can look at that has info on a bunch of labels such as what kind of music they release and their contact info? What about using a service like SubmitHub?

I am hoping that eventually someone will at least hear my work, but I don't want to let other people stop me from releasing my music. At what point should I just forget about labels and try self-releasing? If I go this route, is there anything important I should know (i.e. legal stuff like licensing)? Any other general tips or best practices for getting my stuff out there and onto the major streaming platforms?

hf7ece,1593026253.0,makinghiphop,triangleface333,Developing a platform to help hip hop creators sell/buy beats.,"Hey everyone - I'm hoping this post will be taken as a resource rather than an advertisement.

I've been involved in this and other hip hop / music creator subs for a while now, and among the posts I seem to see constantly are producers looking for advice on how to get their beats in front of artists and ultimately make sales/leases. I've come across so many talented producers who just haven't been able to cut through the clutter.

To help solve this problem, my friend and I started developing 808Link ([www.808link.com](https://www.808link.com)) - a platform where producers use virtual credits to pitch beats to specific artists, who are then required to listen to at least a portion of the beat and provide feedback (the idea for this came from the SubmitHub blog/playlist submission model for those familiar). By paying a micro-fee (\~1$) for the artist to listen to the beat, the producer gets the peace of mind that the artist actually listened, and the artist gets paid to listen to beats (which they are already doing). Additionally, the artist knows that the beat they're hearing was probably not spammed to every artist on IG; rather, the producer had that specific artist in mind. Then, if the artist wants to buy/lease the beat, the two parties are connected to complete the transaction.

I would love to hear feedback from this community on this idea, as well as invite you all (both PRODUCERS and ARTISTS) to sign up for our beta at the site linked above (we're hoping to launch the first iteration of the platform in August). Thanks for taking the time to read, and please feel free to reach out with any questions/feedback!",9,0.85,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/makinghiphop/comments/hf7ece/developing_a_platform_to_help_hip_hop_creators/,Developing a platform to help hip hop creators sell/buy beats.,developing a platform to help hip hop creators sell/buy beats.,"Hey everyone - I'm hoping this post will be taken as a resource rather than an advertisement.

Hello there.  
I've been thinking about my music and the way I share it and I now know that I do everything wrong.  
I've been uploading music in the internet since maybe 2010, and I had no illusions about gaining fame and money so basically I almost didn't do anything in terms of promoting my stuff. Lack of earnings does not scare me, but generally I just want people to hear my music.

Long story short, today I have 1 full-length album (experimental electronic + ambient, with a little bit of shoegaze), 2 EPs (one is techno, idm and the other is again quite experimental in terms of genre but I would say it is experimental electronic, sometimes triphop), couple of soundtracks I did for short movies and upcoming LP. All of this released only on my bandcamp and soundcloud accounts which has almost funny amount of followers.

I am preparing for a music release that is quite important to me, and would like to discuss self-release checklist. This would be helpful for other alternative/indie artists as well. 

This is my list. Your inputs are welcome!

* **1. Distribution company (Distrokid, CDbaby, etc.)**

This is pretty obvious. Probably don't need additional comments here.

&amp;#x200B;

* **2. Release on Bandcamp**

I love Bandcamp, it is a great platform for alternative/indie artists.

For me it has pretty much equal importance as No 1.

&amp;#x200B;

* **3. Music blogs**

I read a recent Reddit post in this group saying that the time of music blogs is over now.

But I think it will be a mistake to disregard this opportunity and totally skip music blogs.

I have few big ones on my list: Little Indie, A&amp;R Factory, This Song Is Sick.

Any other suggestions?

 

* **4. Submithub**

I heard good things about this resource. You pay some $$$ and they will submit your song for a review to different music blogs.

I don't want to invest much into this, but anyway would like to give it a shot.

&amp;#x200B;

* **5. Youtube channels/playlists**

I have few in mind. Will try to get there.

&amp;#x200B;

* **6. Facebook groups**

I am still discovering new useful Facebook groups. I think it can give some good exposure.

&amp;#x200B;

* **7. Instagram?**

I remember a recent post in this group a couple of weeks ago, and importance of Instagram was highlighted there.

Personally I did not have a good experience on Instagram few years ago as a photographer. 

Tons of likes/followers, but most of them seemed fake or bots to me. I quit Instagram a while ago. 

Will have to start from scratch for my music project. But this is what I have most doubts about: doesn't seem efficient enough to justify spending a lot of time/efforts.

&amp;#x200B;

Have you had any luck promoting your music on Instagram?

&amp;#x200B;

* **8. Reddit groups?** 

Reddit seems to be huge, but at the same time it is very subdivided.

Have you received any more or less substantial traffic from Reddit?

Any particular group you could recommend?

&amp;#x200B;

* **9. Radio stations**

This seems to be tough and almost impossible. But I'd like to give it a try anyway.

Has anyone had luck approaching radio stations without any connections?

&amp;#x200B;

* **10. Craigslist**

This seems to be a crappy option, but I still see a lot of bands promoting their music there. Why not?

&amp;#x200B;

Spotify proclaiming itself the land of opportunity for  developing artists and yet still one of the best ways to showcase new  music, many are eager for faster ways to get more streams and followers.

Unfortunately “Rome wasn’t built in a day”! And in bigger ventures,  it takes a whole team just to handle that simple task. Plus your fans as much as your future partners (incl. Spotify) will essentially focus on engagement: Better 100 streamers than 1000 inactive followers.

Long story short, there is no secret or shortcut to it as we happily share our little knowledge with these **10 must-do tips for increasing your fanbase and get more streams on Spotify**.

## 👇10 tips to get more streams and followers on Spotify

## 1. Submit your music to playlist curators

Step One: Spotify For Artists.  
Yes, they will not respond, yes they will see your submission. Out of thousands of releases to review every day you must stand out. You’re not featured in MINT on day one? No  worries, stay focused, the best way to catch their attention remains :

## 2. Create your own playlist

Do it yourslf ! The simplest way to get more streams and gain  followers is to start building your own playlists. Be active, creative and manage your own personal playlists around your releases. **Most importantly, it allows you to trade your tracks with other curators**, share your music and increase your presence : it’s a win-win situation.

## 3. Build your image

Have a strong “Brand” image is essential, on Spotify but especially  on social media. It’s a showcase for your music and an effective way to build your identity. Get verified on Spotify as an Artist, and present your graphic charter/press pics for a slick-looking profile.

## 4. Contact Music Blogs

Good thing you’re sharing: now we can’t all acknowledge 10 000  engaged friends willing to listen to your music from day one. You might also want to reach out to new audiences and convert them as fans. Music blogs are the best way to do that, if your music covered on a blog, it’s guaranteed to be seen by people who already like the genre. On  SubmitHub for example, prepare a good promo package, with a press release, press shots, your bio, and obviously your song.

## 5. Support artists and their work

Sharing is helping. Don’t hesitate to support and share other artists’ tracks/playlists: **LET THEM KNOW.** Also, the following artists you like are another way to help your fans discover the music you’re into.

## 6. Promote to Labels

Today, Record Labels often have playlists on Spotify. Contact them with their submission link, on socials, or by email. On top of that,  they can be interested in signing your next tracks, and it’s a good way to build up a relationship with them.

## 7. Use Emails

Your email list is an extremely valuable tool to promote your music.  Progressively, your mailing list will grow, and you can build a strategy around it, offering something exclusive (a Spotify pre-save, an alternate version of a song, or an anticipated announcement, for example).

## 8. Share your Spotify links… everywhere!

If you have a website, take the opportunity to get more streams: add embed players links, “Follow” buttons, QR Codes (Spotify Codes)… All related to Spotify! For more info, you can check the Spotify Developer.  Also, you can find some promotion tools like Linkfire.

## 9. Ask your distributor for help

Often forgotten, in case you run a Record Label asking your distribution is always a good thing. The more involved they will be, the better the chance to see results, no matter the Streaming Platform.  Among the huge amount of releases one distribution company delivers in a  day, they’re very often consulted by Spotify on relevant ones to feature. This is actually one of the key assets to raise when picking a  digital distributor.

## 10. Be patient!

Don’t worry, success isn’t easy and can’t be achieved overnight. It’s important to stay active, release great music, and engage with your audience. The rest will come naturally!

My method of promoting currently is: -creating the song and artwork

* writing a press release with a photo (shot on my phone but high enough def for websites) 
* pitching on Spotify for artists 
* emailing the press release with a SoundCloud link to probably around 40 websites I've sourced myself. Resulting in 1 write up. 
* hitting up submithub (taking a beating in the feedback but then having 1/2 postive responses after 20 submissions 
* finding playlists on Reddit and pitching the curators, resulting in 0 adds 
* sending the press release to local radio (I'm in Melbourne so pretty lucky to have two or three independent stations) Ending in some good feedback but no plays. 
* I tried a couple of Instagram ads with animations to go with the music which ended up in a slight boost in likes but no proof of conversion to Spotify / Bandcamp plays.

It all seems a lot of effort for 150 plays on Spotify and 300 from the Premiere on someone else's SoundCloud account. I'm trying to manage my expectations for this next release, as the feedback seems less positive than my previous release.

Mailing Lists: Behind Each Email Address Is A Relationship Worth Nurturing

The  motto is Give, Give, Give. Give people value in exchange for their  email address so you can start building an email list. In marketing, an  email list is one of your most valuable assets. Sites like [show.co](https://www.show.co/) and [feature.fm](https://feature.fm/) offer Smart Links that help you with this.

An  email subscriber wants value in the form of exclusivity, build a  one-on-one a relationship with each fan. Instead of just sending bulk  emails, you could send personalised follow-up emails.

In  your newsletter, make sure you’re consistently giving. Tell them  stories, inspirations behind your new songs, send a never-heard before  demo track that only they will hear, video footage. Concentrate on the  exclusivity, the more you provide the more they will engage.

Eventually,  you can finally make your first offer, something you have created for  your fans that you want to sell. Be it a t-shirt, vinyl or a  subscription that invites them to more exclusivity. After building a  relationship, giving value to your fans, talking and engaging them like  real people via email, they are many times more likely to want to  purchase something from you, share your music, tell their friends and  support your music.

Ads will help  you find your fans, but it’s up to you to foster the relationship, not  be too pushy, and then sell to them when the time is right.

Spotify &amp; Navigating The Playlist Landscape

If  you have the time, make your own playlist curator database as over 50%  of the independent blogs put email or social media accounts in the  playlist description. Your best option to acquire these emails is  spotontrack.com who offer a free 14-day trial period, then about $10 USD  a month. These guys have complete access to Spotify and Apple Music’s  API. They have a playlist section where you can type in your genre and  you’ll get every single playlist ranked by subscriber count. In April  2020, Spotify announced they had done spring cleaning, with bot farms  boosting artists streams and revenue, they have removed inactive  accounts and deleted fake/bot followers from their service so now these  playlists should be full of actual music fans,

There  are a few playlist owned by the major labels so don’t waste your time  with playlists owned by the account names Filtr (that’s Sony), Topsify  (Warner) and Digster (Universal). I’m creating my own ‘hip hop’ database  and there is over 7 million results. The 20 top emails I’ve acquired  all have a following of 100k-250k and some of them blatantly sell  monthly placements on all their playlists claiming your song reaches a  total of 400k subscribers for around $60 USD. I haven’t used this kind  of service but am interested in trying, but also unaware of the  legitimacy of this kind of deal but it’s very tempting. Use these  services at your own discretion but if you do please let me know if you  get positive results.

If you don’t  have time for spreadsheets I know fiverr.com sells ‘Spotify Curator  Emails’but hard to know what the quality is like, what the genre is and  if they’re still active. I’m going to make my own list from scratch and  I’ll make my submission through a service like MailChimp as I’m planning  on creating a database of around 500-1000 accounts. If you are only  going to submit to the top 20 playlists of your genre, you could just  contact them via email and make it more personal so your submission  stands out.

The Evolution Of Music PR &amp; Why You Don’t Need To Spend Thousands On A Publicist

As  someone with a background in music PR, keeping up with the latest music  blogs, playlists, and their contact info is a full-time job, it  involves creating relationships with these curators, creating a database  and then creating a press release campaign that can mostly be ignored  unless you offer a ‘donation’.

[Submithub.com](https://submithub.com/)  is an example of how music publicity is evolving, getting your music to  prominent curators and bloggers doesn’t have to be a hard work and you  don't have to spend thousands on a publicist that ends up giving you  zero coverage like me in 2010.

SubmitHub  offers a way for artists to submit songs to blog sites, playlist  curators, social media influencers and even record labels;. You submit  your song to well-known blogs/playlists, they listen to your single and  then you receive feedback from each curator. You get to filter curators  with options like Genre, Submission Approval % and much more for optimal  targeting.

The system works with  credits, based on the popularity of the blog/curator you’ll spend 1-3  credits per submission.  For $80 USD you can buy 100 credits but  discount coupons are around, I believe this is the minimum amount you  need for an effective campaign but buying more will mean more  submissions, more reviews and possibly more coverage. A lot of the  reviews are helpful but music is subjective so a lot of them contradict  each other. Unless you have a song that REALLY stands out, you’re going  to get a lot of rejections so be prepared. You will receive feedback  within 48hrs.

[Mysphera.co](https://mysphera.co/)  is a personal favourite, they do campaigns targeting playlist curators  that last weeks and only charge $20-$30 per campaign which is the most  affordable I’ve come across, and they really put in the work.  With the  music industry changing it allows services like this that aren’t  designed to take advantage but are built by people that have a strong  passion for spreading new music, they know the majority of us are  struggling financially, and they just want to help. I’ve always had  positive results from this one and I love everything about it.

To Be Taken Serious You Need A Professional Website With A Mailing List

Every  artist needs their own website but being an independent artist means  you also need mailing list capabilities, bio, professional photos, a  commission-free avenue to sell your music, merch, tickets, you might  need crowdfunding, a fan subscription service, a gig calendar, a way for  fans to pre-order your next release and you might want to implement a  blog.

I recommend [Bandzoogle.com](https://bandzoogle.com/)as  they cover all the above and more. Starting from only pay $8.46 a  month, which includes a .com domain name and an array of stunning, easy  to customize templates designed for musicians with every website feature  thought of, just drag and drop onto the page. They add new features and  templates constantly.

Uploading  your songs, albums and EPs are simple, you can sell them  (commission-free) or you can give out downloads in exchange for email  addresses which is a great way to get more email subscribers. I believe  mailing lists are the most important way of maintaining your fan base  and plenty of industry experts agree so this is absolutely essential  when creating a website. They have an excellent mailing list service  that makes it easy to implement a sign-up button on your homepage, easy  to upload your existing emails and you can even send out newsletters  from within the site. No email management platform needed.

gvy3u1,1591204789.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,Agent-Double-Agent,"Would you rather spend money pushing your tracks to playlists using a service, or find the curators yourself and build a relationship with them?","I feel like playlisting is a really interesting topic to talk about because it’s becoming more relevant for indie musicians as a marketing tool for reaching a wider audience. The way I see it, there’s two ways you can do this:

The quick way is spending more money on getting your song pushed out to playlists (using a service like Submithub or Playlist Push)

This leaves you with more time to make the music as you’re basically outsourcing the media relations process to a third party. 

I want to say I trust those services, but I still have some reservations about the quality of their leads (sometimes their curators are really good and have good/active followings, but other times I’ve had songs pushed to dead playlists/blogs).

The other way is to just find the curators yourself and establish a real relationship with them. 

This can be a really time-consuming process because you need to scour your main streaming platform for playlists that are similar to your discography. 

Then, once you find a curator, it can take several days to build a meaningful relationship to where you both get value. 

But it’s free and also really good experience for networking online. 

So which way is best? I feel like it depends on financials: either you have the money to delegate the process, or you can spend the time &amp; mental energy to do it yourself for free while gaining good experience.

This can be a really time-consuming process because you need to scour your main streaming platform for playlists that are similar to your discography.

gtjtt7,1590865784.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,MBmusic3,I'm on an Editorial List....Help! Now what do I do?,"After 6 months of regular releases, slaving over a HUGE variety of music and putting up about 15 tracks and 4 collaborations... I was about to take a big step back, after watching my numbers plummet from respectable, 12k monthly listeners, down to 200 a day, down to 94 listeners last night.  After spending hours emailing, using social media, and doing everything I could behind the scenes to get my music out there, only to watch the numbers crater to less than 100 listeners.

&amp;#x200B;

And then... today I log into Spotify for Artisits....

&amp;#x200B;

**I've been added to an Editorial Playlist with over half a million listeners**

&amp;#x200B;

I took an hour to just lay down and quietly celebrate.  This was a solo guitar release I recorded in my bedroom, mixed/mastered myself during the lockdown.  But - **I realize I'm in a bit over my head and need guidance:**  I think now would be the time to really capitalize on the momentum with a paid Spotify official ad, and double down on my mailing list and social media to make the most of this playlist placement.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Does anyone have any success or experience using Spotify's ad platform?**

I use Distrokid to distribute - is there anything special I need to do to claim royalty money or copyright if the music is entirely my instrumental arrangements, and solely recorded and performed by me?

&amp;#x200B;

* I've had moderate to good success on Submithub
* I've had good success on DailyPlaylists this month
* I've tried doing a modest Fivr campaing - one was legit FB promotion for 7$
* the other paid playlist service was 20$ and the streams seemed to come out of nowhere, so I didn't mess with that for fear of it being bots or flagging my account a few months back

My genre is predominantly Spanish guitar, with classical, world, and acoustic music leanings.  I have a singer-songwriter track, and 3-4 tracks that are rap or electronic, that I played bass &amp; acoustic guitar on if anyone is curious about the genres. **What would you do if you were in my situation?**",1,0.67,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/gtjtt7/im_on_an_editorial_listhelp_now_what_do_i_do/,I'm on an Editorial List....Help!

gmvoxd,1589917359.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,[deleted],"My experiences with paid promotion so far (submithub, playlistpush, facebook)","**If you're lazy, just read the TL:DR section.** So I recently pushed a track hard for the first time, spending quite a bit of money on it. Thought I'd share my experience so far with these popular platforms. Please note these are my opinions and not facts; platforms are also changing over time, for example both submithub &amp; playlistpush has changed quite a bit since they started (both of them seem to be getting better). This is of May 2020.

.

**Facebook ads (with Spotify link):**

Very difficult to get any streams this way. Facebook is good if you want to reach out with information (ie, ""I'm playing live this summer!"") but not for getting streams. Also, you MUST be very specific about your target audience. The FB algorithms seemingly show your ad primarily to people who usually randomly like &amp; click stuff. This is probably not what you want... a 30 sec preview clip with Spotify API will also not count as a stream. I tried several campains over a few weeks to different countries &amp; target audiences, and my conclusion is that it's a tricky platform to use to get Spotify streams specifically.

.

**TL:DR: Facebook ads are good for specific things (reaching out with information), but very expensive if you count it per stream with a Spotify link. I've had better results with YouTube videos in the past though; unfortunately a shiny Spotify preview 30 sec clip will not count as a stream.**

.

**Submithub:**

While the authors claim to be taking playlist curators seriously and having quality control, this is simply not  true. I've seen banned Spotify playlists that, even a week later, still remained on Submithub &amp; people sending +20 daily premium submissions. (Ie, someone makes money to listen to music and their fake bot playlist doesn't even exist anymore...) If you look at these curators including ""really good bloggers"" as they call them, some have an FB account with +100k likes but almost no likes or interaction on posts. I'd say too many of curators on submithub are shady in the sense that it's not useful to you as an artist to get reposted to bot playlist &amp; some random ""big"" influencer that has a bunch of fake likes/streams or they brag with a +1 million subs youtube channel, but there's only famous artists on there (you won't get reposted there). Or a big Spotify playlist but you'll never end up on the good ones, just their ""dumpster"" playlist for reposts from Submithub so their stats will look good &amp; they can keep making money by ""listening"" to people's music.

.

**TL:DR:** **While the above sounded very negative, Submithub is decent if you do your research. Just be aware that it takes a LOT of time and effort to find out the good curators (don't be fooled by shiny stats; you have to dig deep). After you use the service, I recommend creating a list of curators were your sort out good ones and also a blacklist (yes, a blacklist). You do NOT want to end up on fake playlists; make sure to post to curators with a high premium following on Spotify.**

.

**Playlist Push:**

I was sceptical because of the combo of lack of settings when you submit a song &amp; the price you pay, everything is pretty much automated. What happens now? I like to have more control. Well, I was  pleased to find that all curators you get posted to write (often quite extensive) reviews of your song that clearly show they've listened to the song (regardless if they accept/reject). I also saw a curator that got banned during my campaign because he didn't live up to the quality standards, so that was a nice touch, they seemingly work actively to maintain serious curators. I got several reposts from here to big playlists with +100k followers and most of them seem to be the real deal (even though you'll likely end up far down in the playlists themselves, just the big artists at the top; altough I did end up on 9th place on a very big playlist among world-famous artists, woohoo!)

.

**TL:DR: Overall, I'm impressed with the Playlist Push experience and this will likely be my go-to promotion service for upcoming songs. Hopefully they will introduce more filters in the future, but you will get REAL curators and playlists to look at your song; they work activly to sort out the BS. (And no, I don't work for them).**

If anyone out there has any pointers and tips on how I can contact curators directly I would love to know. &x200B; Thank You,hello everyone. i am having some trouble sifting through all the playlist curator platforms that are out there as i would like to submit my music to curators to get added to their playlists.   i would like to get in contact with them directly than go through the many charging services that are out there that promise to get your music on playlists.    i used one recently called spotimatch which has had a name change to matchify. i did a test using their service and my curated playlist on spotimatch. i sent myself a request from spotimatch to be added to my playlist and i never received any notification from spotimatch to say that there was a request to have new music on my playlist.   i tried submithub and i have not been successful also.    what i am looking for is to directly market my music to curators that i belive have awesome playlists. i don't want to use the mass marketing technique.   if anyone out there has any pointers and tips on how i can contact curators directly i would love to know. &x200b; thank you,5,187

g9031s,1587991817.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,dick_fin,Where to get genuine feedback on non-electronic music?,"So I’ve been using a lot of subreddits, Submithub, etc. and cannot get anything beyond vague feedback. 

Reddit feedback seems like people copy and paste “wow! So cool!” just to get people to look at their stuff or get a score on some of the subs that require it.

Submithub so far has been so not genuine. I paid for premium credits and said feedback is important. How is “too repetitive” good feedback when they’ve only listened to 34 seconds?  Can I note that song only repeats the first chord progression once (one in beginning one in end)! All of the feedback there has been total garbage and uninformative, I don’t think I will try it again unless something valuable comes my way telling me how to make the track better.

Does anyone know where I can get real feedback from people who will actually listen to music? I want real feedback from real people who use real instruments.

My name is Rob, I run the blog Pastel Wasteland with a good friend of mine, and I recently joined Submithub around a month ago. From my perspective, it has been a godsend in terms of being able to get organised and finally offer an alternative to an inbox full of unpersonalized press releases.

On our blog, we like to promote music that is often a bit more left of field, unique or interesting in some way. We do cover pop, EDM etc, but I'm always holding out for something batshit crazy that demands my attention.

My question is this. What sort of feedback is the most helpful to you guys? I'm not someone who enjoys going on winding rants, using words that sound like they've come from a b-movie vhs blurb. I prefer to be technical where possible, explaining what didn't fit in with our tastes, and my feedback is also usually around 100 words compared to the 10 minimum. I think we are doing quite a good job with the feedback, our ratings definitely point in that direction, I'd just love to hear what sort of things would really help in terms of feedback.

Also just as a final note- keep up the hard work! I've worked in the industry on the bottom rungs of an indie label and more recently as a music video director, and I understand the crushing feeling of a rejection and the hopeless feeling when you can't pinpoint what didn't work.

The first time seemed okay. I got on three playlists all made by the user ""Uber Playlist"" which returned 3.3k stream from around 3k listeners. Not a great invest meant for $60-$90.

I'm currently doing the second campaign and was added again to 1 of the 3 playlists ""Popular Tik Tok Music"" which has 21k followers. This time around, the playlist has literally returned zero engagement and it's has been on the playlist for four days now. I don't know if it's because of COVID, but I doubt a Spotify playlist with 21k followers is gonna return 0 listeners and 0 streams in four days.

All in all, be wary when paying for playlist promotions. Nobody is really a gatekeeper to getting on really popular playlists. You have to build those connections by finding great curators and reaching out to them. The best way promotion I've used is Submithub, where I have a 14% acceptance rate. I've submitted to 114 playlist curators, blog and labels and have been approved 16 times. The results from Submithub are a little sketchy at times but its all really trial and error until you find outlets to submit to that match your music style.

g2uvkq,1587097358.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,pb4uplay,Why I Love Submithub,"Hey guys!

I see a lot of Submithub hate going on around here but I just wanted to share my experience because it has developed over the past year or two and I think that this service sometimes needs a second chance.

For a little background, I've run 3 song through SH, and each one to a growing amount of success. my acceptance rate has grown from about 5%-15% over these releases and I have been able to garner attention from larger and larger outlets.

Here are my key points and reasons why I think it really is worth it:

1) Submithub literally does the job of a promoter.  Although some people may not get any bites at all, at the end of the day all a promoter does is put your song in front of some ears, the rest is up to your sound.  For the money I think it's worth it.  I have seen my monthly Spotify numbers swell from 50-1000+ in the past year and the only promo I do is Submithub and some instagram targeted ads.

2) The feedback is legit helpful! My first two songs, I would always get the my hooks weren't satisfying enough, and I started to change my songwriting... My latest release has reflected this change and is a much bigger hit among tastemakers so far (two weeks away from release)

3) Some bloggers have declined my song yet still reached out to me and given me tips and advice which is helpful!

4) and last but not least... HOT OR NOT.  I love this feature and it has be SO helpful for me to gauge songs, but also is believe it or not a great way to meet people, and being on the charts there got me attention from blogs I DIDN'T SUBMIT TO (namely, Dummy Mag, a hype machine blog) put me on a playlist with 2k+ followers and plugged on all their social media with my handles!).  Not to mention you can earn free credits now!

So what do y'all think?

I don't know about you but I can't find a more legit or better way to promote and I am incredibly happy to spend 100$ here every release... I now have 1-4K listens on every song from people all over the world, when submithub was essentially my only promo.",19,,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/g2uvkq/why_i_love_submithub/,Why I Love Submithub,why i love submithub,"Hey guys!

g1qfku,1586951390.0,independentmusic,dilzx,Getting more streams,"I've been preparing for my first release for a few months and have been doing a lot of research on music promotion and thought I'd share my knowledge, im no expert but I'd like to think it would help at least someone. Feel free to reply with further tips.

- I am going to start off with one of the least talked about forms of music promotion which is sharing your music with fellow musicians. There is no community quite like our own. All musicians would want to help each other out as we understand the struggle and there is often a mutual benefit to sharing each others music. If I share your music to all my fans and you share my music, there is more to gain than to lose and there is no shame in doing this. If I presave your song and you presave mine we both win!

- Spotify playlist placement: Everyone looks at this and thinks this would be amazing if a spotify curator picks their song and puts it on a playlist. You'd garner a load of streams through this. How do we get on their radar? Firstly, to be eligible, you need submit your song through spotify for artists. To do this you need to claim your artist profile and submit on the site. Secondly, CUSTOMISE your artist profile. Add a profile and banner picture, write a bio, share your live show dates, share your playlist. Sharing pictures from your instagram gallery such as pictures of you performing really looks good to curators. This all shows spotify that you are actively trying to connect with your auedience and care about how you represent yourself. Thirdly, PRESAVES, having presaves and preorders really help sell your song. It shows spotify that there is an auedience anticipating your release and shows them you're worth giving a chance to. Finally be aware that ALBUM ART COUNTS TOO! If your artwork doesn't look professional they will not push your song! The artwork is key. On some devices such as on phones apple music/deezer/spotify apps show the artwork as the main part of your screen whilst you stream the song. If the artwork is a fuzzy photo of you from your webcam or phone it won't seem marketable to them regardless of how your song sounds.

- Play the algorithm correctly: Spotify have an automated algorithm which helps push your songs. You need to understand how this works in order to make use of it. There are automated playlists such as discover weekly and release radar which you have a better chance of getting on than a curated playlist. In order to get the algorithm to pick your song for a playlist you need to have good stats. Im not talkig about a high volume of streams but instead a good play to save ratio (I dont actually know what its called) but lets say 10% of your streamers save your song to their library. This would boost your chance in the algorithm pushing your song. Moreover, having your listeners adding your songs to their playlist also helps and the algorithm will recognise this too.

- Independent curators: Instead of expecting a spotify playlist placement you are probably better off submitting to user created playlists. This can not only help you increase your streams, this can also help get your track be pushed on algorithm created playlists. I've seen people try and track down users with spotify playlists as not all of them have their socials showcased. BUT I think it is a little weird searching for someones contact details when they havent shared it just to get on their playlist. Instead try and contact users who actually present themselves. A good site to use is submithub, its free and can land you on some decent playlists.

- Youtube: There are tonnes of youtube channels that allow you to submit music to them. Often, these channels are genre based so you can easily reach your target auedience. It's easier to go for smaller channels. Because the channels are genre based, you are likely to get listeners then search for your song and save them and/or add you to their playlists. Try and go for smaller channels for a better chance at being showcased. NOTE: They are going to want to monetise the video so I advise you to be aware of this and not complain when they dont send any money your way. AND watch out for if you use a service that automatically copyright strikes your music when used by others

- Try for music blogs: This seems a little unconventional in this day and age but they can definetely help. There are tonnes of music blogs with a great following which can definetely help you reach  a new auedience. 

- Submithub, there are plenty of similar sites that allow you to submit your songs to bloggers, influencers, playlist curators, radios, record labels etc.

- Don't be afraid to go for niche playlists: For example, there are playlists such as cultural based playlists specifically for certain cultures. You can get on these spotify playlists by just stating your cultural heritage such as being christian, south asian, african etc. There are also instrument based playlists, if someone wants to listen to a djembe and your song has the djembe in it you can try and get on this playlist. 

- Hashtags, will help your social media reach new people with similar interests. Easy to do too but wont increase streams by a lot if I am being honest, but if you can gain a few fans through this they can then share the song on their pages! 

- Soundcloud: There may be a sort of taboo associated with the term ""soundcloud rapper"" and therefore regardless of the genre of your song you may feel like you dont want to promote on soundcloud. But this is important as around 50% of soundcloud users are fellow musicians so it is a really great way to network and reach other people in the industry. The power of a repost can go a long eay.

Please note that the end of the day your song has to have a certain quality to be able to be marketed so please be aware of this. Recording a song off your phone mic or a vocal that hasnt been mixed well could already cap your streams even before your release. Make sure you pitch to the right people too!

- Warnings: Dont pay to be on a spotify playlist. Spotify dont allow for this and dont pay for streams too. 

Hope this helps

Feel free to reply with further tips.

- I am going to start off with one of the least talked about forms of music promotion which is sharing your music with fellow musicians. There is no community quite like our own. All musicians would want to help each other out as we understand the struggle and there is often a mutual benefit to sharing each others music. If I share your music to all my fans and you share my music, there is more to gain than to lose and there is no shame in doing this. If I presave your song and you presave mine we both win!

- Spotify playlist placement: Everyone looks at this and thinks this would be amazing if a spotify curator picks their song and puts it on a playlist. You'd garner a load of streams through this. How do we get on their radar? Firstly, to be eligible, you need submit your song through spotify for artists. To do this you need to claim your artist profile and submit on the site. Secondly, CUSTOMISE your artist profile. Add a profile and banner picture, write a bio, share your live show dates, share your playlist. Sharing pictures from your instagram gallery such as pictures of you performing really looks good to curators. This all shows spotify that you are actively trying to connect with your auedience and care about how you represent yourself. Thirdly, PRESAVES, having presaves and preorders really help sell your song. It shows spotify that there is an auedience anticipating your release and shows them you're worth giving a chance to. Finally be aware that ALBUM ART COUNTS TOO! If your artwork doesn't look professional they will not push your song! The artwork is key. On some devices such as on phones apple music/deezer/spotify apps show the artwork as the main part of your screen whilst you stream the song. If the artwork is a fuzzy photo of you from your webcam or phone it won't seem marketable to them regardless of how your song sounds.

- Play the algorithm correctly: Spotify have an automated algorithm which helps push your songs. You need to understand how this works in order to make use of it. There are automated playlists such as discover weekly and release radar which you have a better chance of getting on than a curated playlist. In order to get the algorithm to pick your song for a playlist you need to have good stats. Im not talkig about a high volume of streams but instead a good play to save ratio (I dont actually know what its called) but lets say 10% of your streamers save your song to their library. This would boost your chance in the algorithm pushing your song. Moreover, having your listeners adding your songs to their playlist also helps and the algorithm will recognise this too.

- Independent curators: Instead of expecting a spotify playlist placement you are probably better off submitting to user created playlists. This can not only help you increase your streams, this can also help get your track be pushed on algorithm created playlists. I've seen people try and track down users with spotify playlists as not all of them have their socials showcased. BUT I think it is a little weird searching for someones contact details when they havent shared it just to get on their playlist. Instead try and contact users who actually present themselves. A good site to use is submithub, its free and can land you on some decent playlists.

- Youtube: There are tonnes of youtube channels that allow you to submit music to them. Often, these channels are genre based so you can easily reach your target auedience. It's easier to go for smaller channels. Because the channels are genre based, you are likely to get listeners then search for your song and save them and/or add you to their playlists. Try and go for smaller channels for a better chance at being showcased. NOTE: They are going to want to monetise the video so I advise you to be aware of this and not complain when they dont send any money your way. AND watch out for if you use a service that automatically copyright strikes your music when used by others

- Try for music blogs: This seems a little unconventional in this day and age but they can definetely help. There are tonnes of music blogs with a great following which can definetely help you reach  a new auedience. 

- Submithub, there are plenty of similar sites that allow you to submit your songs to bloggers, influencers, playlist curators, radios, record labels etc.

- Don't be afraid to go for niche playlists: For example, there are playlists such as cultural based playlists specifically for certain cultures. You can get on these spotify playlists by just stating your cultural heritage such as being christian, south asian, african etc. There are also instrument based playlists, if someone wants to listen to a djembe and your song has the djembe in it you can try and get on this playlist. 

- Hashtags, will help your social media reach new people with similar interests. Easy to do too but wont increase streams by a lot if I am being honest, but if you can gain a few fans through this they can then share the song on their pages! 

- Soundcloud: There may be a sort of taboo associated with the term ""soundcloud rapper"" and therefore regardless of the genre of your song you may feel like you dont want to promote on soundcloud. But this is important as around 50% of soundcloud users are fellow musicians so it is a really great way to network and reach other people in the industry. The power of a repost can go a long eay.

Please note that the end of the day your song has to have a certain quality to be able to be marketed so please be aware of this. Recording a song off your phone mic or a vocal that hasnt been mixed well could already cap your streams even before your release. Make sure you pitch to the right people too!

- Warnings: Dont pay to be on a spotify playlist. Spotify dont allow for this and dont pay for streams too.

  soundcloud there may be a sort of taboo associated with the term ""soundcloud rapper"" and therefore regardless of the genre of your song you may feel like you dont want to promote on soundcloud. but this is important as around 50% of soundcloud users are fellow musicians so it is a really great way to network and reach other people in the industry. the power of a repost can go a long eay. please note that the end of the day your song has to have a certain quality to be able to be marketed so please be aware of this. recording a song off your phone mic or a vocal that hasnt been mixed well could already cap your streams even before your release. make sure you pitch to the right people too!  warnings dont pay to be on a spotify playlist. spotify dont allow for this and dont pay for streams too.  hope this helps ps if you found this useful you can presave my upcoming single here ",5,1108

fw3buq,1586195339.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,ibekez,Do you guys know of any legit music promotion service? I used these platforms to get heard.,"Heyo. I'm currently looking for ways to promote my music, since I got sick of getting 1 play per week if I was lucky. :D  


I'll share with you what I've found.  


I've checked basically every service, from Fiverr gigs to SoundCloud repost networks (I wouldn't recommend the latter, based on my own experience). Platforms like:  
[SubmitHub](https://www.submithub.com/) (which sometimes does some good, but usually is a waste of Premium credits if you ever end up buying them. Best feedback rejection I got is ""needed an intro""). It also landed me my first label release so, all is...balanced...in the world.  
   
[Hypeddit](https://hypeddit.com/) \-- this is probably one the best ([see results](https://prnt.sc/ru7jyq)). Fans can download through a gate, and other users of the platform can repost your music to earn points and vice versa.  
[Repost Exchange](https://repostexchange.com/hi?r=EGPWX) \-- this is also great, though Campaigns can get buried. I'd suggest sending repost requests to users, especially ones with good response rates (in green). Reposts must last for 48 h or you'll get flagged for un-reposting.  
[SCPlanner](https://scplanner.net/) \-- this can be great too. You can trade reposts with larger channels and networks. Filter by 0 and you'll see large networks that'll pick up your song in return. Reposts usually last 24 h but can be customized.

[Thematic](http://hellothematic.com/artists/) gets you in touch with YouTubers who need music for their videos. I just signed up for it and my song is pending so I don't know too much about it. Maybe someone knows of a better alternative?  


Of course, I've also collected a small email list of about 400 blogs, YouTube channels, and other curators, and have sent to them. Be wary of doing large email blasts from your personal email account, as they will only land in the recipient's spam folder (learned from personal exp :D). I used Sendinblue for this but other musicians recommend MailChimp too. [Sendinblue vs. MailChimp](https://www.sendinblue.com/mailchimp/).  


That's about all I've done/learned in the past 2 weeks. I will update this if I find something new.

Hope everyone is safe and well!

I'm  currently in the process of starting a  collective/label/management/creative outlet company, or just a 'thing'  at the moment. I'm sure there are some other people in this subreddit  too in this position so I hope this post can be of some use...

So far the tracks released have had a really great response on  SoundCloud with people commenting, liking, following, recomending etc. I have started an Instagram account and in the process of creating a YouTube channel too.   


However, I've also been using SubmitHub in an attempt to get the songs out there  but unfortuantely nothing seems to be sticking. It seems trying to get the tracks on blogs etc is quite difficult process to get past the gatekeepers. With the way the market  it is going, it's a sad realtiy that the 'SoundCloud' glory days seem as most people now flock to Spotify and Apple Music to find new music (myself included) However, from a label/collective standpoint, it seems these platforms are a lot more political in terms of playlist sitting, recomendations and getting music on them unless I have misunderstood.

I think  what Bandcamp stands for is great. Again, and I guess this is what the  whole post is about, even on a platform like that - what's the best way  to get your music out there in a way that builds a following and some  traction? Not only that, how do you also go about finding new artists  and talent too? What are some good sites and ways of finding new  artists? I'm very much a 20 something yr old and a laptop atm and there's no scene whatsoever where I live...

I'm currently in the process of starting a collective/label/management/creative outlet company, or just a 'thing' at the moment. I'm sure there are some other people in this subreddit too in this position so I hope this post can be of some use...  


So far I've released two tracks that I've produced and one track produced by a good friend of mine - I made all the artwork for the tracks , have started an Instagram account and in the process of creating a YouTube channel too. So far the tracks have had a really great response on SoundCloud with people commenting, liking, following, recomending etc. I've also been using SubmitHub in an attempt to get the songs out there but unfortuantely nothing seems to be sticking. With the way the market it is going, it's a sad realtiy that the 'SoundCloud' glory days seem to have passed due to the fact most people now flock to Spotify and Apple Music to find new music which, from my understanding, as platforms are a lot more political in terms of playlist sitting, recomendations and getting music on them.

fl75gt,1584609691.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,nakashine,for the ones curious about SubmitHub and PlaylistPush,"I got some adds on both ( a lot).The playlists are very nice.

SubmitHub is harder to get approved.

PlaylistPush you will get something for sure.

It all depends on the songs, if the song is good it will have a good reaction.

(I have 25 years of producing experience, plus collaborated with an audio engineer, so hopefully my songs are 'on a level')

What you gain : Streams , followers and saves/add to library... What's the best of these, it's definitively 'saves' ... I got a huge percent of plays from 'listener's own playlist and library' which is coming from the saves. Second best is followers, more followers you have easier to get into the algorithms. Plus release radar is a huge thing.I get followers from playlists but also ask people I know to follow me , one by one.

Biggest rejection reason is : Wrong genre or 'not our audience' , so be extra careful not to tag genres that aren't relevant.

My campaigns haven't ended so I might get even more adds.

I paid around 300 + 280 + 14 = 594$.

If I would spend this on instagram, facebook or youtube ads, I would gain ZERO and the money would be gone.

TLDR: It works, you'll get added to legit playlists with real people, the downside is it's expensive.

TLDR2: Highly recommended.",30,,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/fl75gt/for_the_ones_curious_about_submithub_and/,for the ones curious about SubmitHub and PlaylistPush,for the ones curious about submithub and playlistpush,"I got some adds on both ( a lot).The playlists are very nice.

fk7kci,1584460403.0,audius,RuffaroMaxheim,An interview with Crowd Favorite Winner: Visionnaire,"In a genre that’s currently being predominated by clout feigns and social media influencers, Visionnaire stands out as someone whose taken a completely different approach to his music. Paying homage to black culture and art throughout the world in his music, Visionnaire is a talented and genuinely unique artist that I want to hear more from in the future.

Last Month, Visionnaire came out ahead of the pack, challenging the many naysayers who’d say his music is too socially charged, to be crowned as [r/Audius’](https://www.reddit.com/r/Audius) first-ever Crowd Favorite for March 2020.

Speaking with me, Visionnaire recalled his journey from its start to today, gave his impressions on the Audius Platform, and revealed his plans for the near future:

**First off, I wanted to start by thanking you for taking the time out of your day for this interview and ask how you’re doing today?**

&gt;**Visionnaire:** I’m doing well and feeling blessed, thanks for asking. Things are crazy right now (coronavirus lockdown), but there’s opportunity in everything if you look at it the right way. I hope things are well with the Audius team in LA, too.

**I’m glad to hear that you are doing well. I’ve heard that you’re from New York, is that true?**

&gt;**Visionnaire:** From NY, but I’ve been all over in one way or another.

**As someone who’s been listening to your music for the past month, I think some questions people would ask themselves after listening to your music are “Who is Visionnaire?” and “What is his mission or aspirations going forward?” Can you expound upon those questions?**

&gt;**Visionnaire:** For sure. Visionaire is an artistic concept that places more emphasis on the “why” than “who.” Without a central identity or face to tie the work to, people focus on the work itself rather than the person making it, which is what I want and am comfortable with (lol). Pedestals are awesome and necessary, but I strongly believe there’s another way to disseminate information, create culture, and propagate ideas.  
&gt;  
&gt;As far as the mission, Visionaire is an illumination of the ubiquity in black culture and art through music. My work is an infusion of baile funk, house, techno, afrobeat, contemporary R&amp;B, hip-hop, jazz, etc.; art forms that we (black people) created and continue to cultivate through our diasporic interaction. I want to show everyone how connected all of these modes of expression are and find the intersecting points.

**That’s honestly awesome, and I can hear that through the effort and care you put in all of your tracks to fuse those styles. To me, you seem like someone who’s really in-tune with music and your response kind of fits with my next two questions. What is your earliest memory of music, and how musical is your family history?**

&gt;**Visionnaire:** Thanks, that means a lot. I’ definitely spent time developing my sound, and the songwriting is as meaningful to me as I plan for it to be for others. The entire process is therapeutic. On my earliest memory: I’d say listening to ‘The Shining’ by Dilla then ‘Thriller’ by MJ right after that. Those two albums made me obsess over creating music. Also, my family isn’t musical at all. I’m the weird one, for sure, lol.

**When did you officially decide to pursue music as a career, i.e., when did you first decide to head to the studio or get studio equipment/software?**

&gt;**Visionnaire:** Hmm...I was very young when I decided to make music. I think it all started on GarageBand. It seemed like it was the only thing I had control of in my life; I could do whatever I wanted.

**Is it safe to say that you are primarily a Mac User?**

&gt;**Visionnaire:** Definitely. LPX (Logic Pro X) for everything, but I also can use Pro Tools, Ableton (a little), and I know my way around FL as well.

**In 2019 you dropped your debut album** ***bloom.*** **Can you tell me a little about that project and meaning behind the name?**

&gt;**Visionnaire:** [*bloom.*](https://audius.co/vsnaire/album/bloom.-889) is an abstract album depicting the past, present, and future of blackness. Every song is connected to one another through either lyrical interpolation or song key. Each record speaks to the ideas of self-love (“[tailfeather.](https://audius.co/vsnaire/tailfeather.-7667)”), sexuality (“[lift.](https://audius.co/vsnaire/lift.-7672)” &amp; “[crave.](https://audius.co/vsnaire/crave.-7670)”), and recognition of marginalized peoples’ struggles and triumphs (“[bless.](https://audius.co/vsnaire/bless.-7666)”, “[tattoo.](https://audius.co/vsnaire/tattoo.-feat.-kxng-rxme-7671)”, and “[flower child.](https://audius.co/vsnaire/flower-child.-7673)”). *bloom.* is about imagining new futures, rather than allowing the past to dictate the futures we can strive toward.

**Yesterday, you put out a brand new track called “gaslight.”. I’ve listened to it a couple of times already, but for our audience who haven’t heard it yet, can you tell us a little about the track and what it means to be “whipping with the gaslight.”**

&gt;**Visionnaire:** ⛽️ Yessir! “[gaslight.](https://audius.co/vsnaire/gaslight.-55803)” is about hardship and the methods we sometimes use to cope with the life we lead (or are forced into by the situations we’re faced with).  
&gt;  
&gt;The idea for this record came at a rough time in my life; I was driving home with about $10 to my name, and literally no gas in the car I was driving, trying to make it home. Luckily, I hit green lights all the way back, which allowed me to coast to the gas station, put $5 in, and get home.  
&gt;  
&gt;“[gaslight.](https://audius.co/vsnaire/gaslight.-55803)” is a sonic encapsulation of that experience. “whipping with the gaslight” means making it to your destination in life, despite the challenges.

**Final questions. Where did you first hear about Audius? Also, since joining last year, what have been your impressions of the platform so far?**

&gt;**Visionnaire:** I found [Audius on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AudiusProject) randomly and connected to the ethos of the organization somewhat immediately. As you can imagine, my socially charged content has had trouble permeating playlists and blogs ran by tastemakers who only want to hear certain types of music. I’ve been struggling to increase my visibility as an artist for years through alternative yet traditional platforms that just flat out don’t care about truly independent artists (SubmitHub, Spotify, paid playlisting companies, Rapxrnb, Rnbradar, etc.).  
&gt;  
&gt;Connecting with Alex and interacting with the community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/KhNMQWK) was the first time a streaming platform actually responded to me as an artist. To me, that’s huge. I hope that can continue for me as well as all talented artists on there who deserve recognition.

Visionnaire is on track to release a new album called *flora.* sometime this summer and has revealed that it will release on Audius, so be on the lookout for it!

Lastly, Visionnaire has told me to let you guys know that he’s open to collaborations. If you’re in the [Audius Discord](https://discord.gg/KhNMQWK), you can message him up at **vsnaire#4145**

Be sure to keep up with Visionnaire on his [Website](https://vsnaire.com/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vsnaire), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/vsnaire_/), and [Audius](https://audius.co/vsnaire), of course, for all the latest!

","in a genre that’s currently being predominated by clout feigns and social media influencers, visionnaire stands out as someone whose taken a completely different approach to his music. paying homage to black culture and art throughout the world in his music, visionnaire is a talented and genuinely unique artist that i want to hear more from in the future. last month, visionnaire came out ahead of the pack, challenging the many naysayers who’d say his music is too socially charged, to be crowned as r/audius’, but there’s opportunity in everything if you look at it the right way. i hope things are well with the audius team in la, too. **i’m glad to hear that you are doing well. i’ve heard that you’re from new york, is that true?** >**visionnaire** from ny, but i’ve been all over in one way or another. **as someone who’s been listening to your music for the past month, i think some questions people would ask themselves after listening to your music are “who is visionnaire?” and “what is his mission or aspirations going forward?” can you expound upon those questions?** >**visionnaire** for sure. visionaire is an artistic concept that places more emphasis on the “why” than “who.” without a central identity or face to tie the work to, people focus on the work itself rather than the person making it, which is what i want and am comfortable with (lol). pedestals are awesome and necessary, but i strongly believe there’s another way to disseminate information, create culture, and propagate ideas.   >   >as far as the mission, visionaire is an illumination of the ubiquity in black culture and art through music. my work is an infusion of baile funk, house, techno, afrobeat, contemporary r&b, hip-hop, jazz, etc.; art forms that we (black people) created and continue to cultivate through our diasporic interaction. i want to show everyone how connected all of these modes of expression are and find the intersecting points. **that’s honestly awesome, and i can hear that through the effort and care you put in all of your tracks to fuse those styles. to me, you seem like someone who’s really in-tune with music and your response kind of fits with my next two questions. what is your earliest memory of music, and how musical is your family history?** >**visionnaire** thanks, that means a lot. i’ definitely spent time developing my sound, and the songwriting is as meaningful to me as i plan for it to be for others. the entire process is therapeutic. on my earliest memory i’d say listening to ‘the shining’ by dilla then ‘thriller’ by mj right after that. those two albums made me obsess over creating music. also, my family isn’t musical at all. i’m the weird one, for sure, lol. **when did you officially decide to pursue music as a career, i.e., when did you first decide to head to the studio or get studio equipment/software?** >**visionnaire** hmm...i was very young when i decided to make music. i think it all started on garageband. it seemed like it was the only thing i had control of in my life; i could do whatever i wanted. **is it safe to say that you are primarily a mac user?** >**visionnaire** definitely. lpx (logic pro x) for everything, but i also can use pro tools, ableton (a little), and i know my way around fl as well. **in 2019 you dropped your debut album** ***bloom.*** **can you tell me a little about that project and meaning behind the name?** >**visionnaire** *bloom.*, sexuality (“lift., and recognition of marginalized peoples’ struggles and triumphs (“bless.. *bloom.* is about imagining new futures, rather than allowing the past to dictate the futures we can strive toward. **yesterday, you put out a brand new track called “gaslight.”. i’ve listened to it a couple of times already, but for our audience who haven’t heard it yet, can you tell us a little about the track and what it means to be “whipping with the gaslight.”** >**visionnaire**  yessir! “gaslight..   >   >the idea for this record came at a rough time in my life; i was driving home with about $10 to my name, and literally no gas in the car i was driving, trying to make it home. luckily, i hit green lights all the way back, which allowed me to coast to the gas station, put $5 in, and get home.   >   >“gaslight..   >   >connecting with alex and interacting with the community on discord( was the first time a streaming platform actually responded to me as an artist. to me, that’s huge. i hope that can continue for me as well as all talented artists on there who deserve recognition. visionnaire is on track to release a new album called *flora.* sometime this summer and has revealed that it will release on audius, so be on the lookout for it! lastly, visionnaire has told me to let you guys know that he’s open to collaborations. if you’re in the audius discord( you can message him up at **vsnaire4145** be sure to keep up with visionnaire on his website( twitter( instagram( and audius( of course, for all the latest!

fgu2bx,1583916359.0,edmproduction,frankiesmusic,Back to the music but discouraged," 

Hello  everyone i've produced edm music from 2002 till 2014 than i had to  stop, and now i'm back craving to do good music, and after 6 years i  have a lot of ideas and that's a bless.

The  issue are the label, they do not even listen your demo, that's feels  absourd i mean i understand they will receive a lot of demo, and i  understand bigger label do not really care about demos because they  already have the material and artists they need, but it also appear that  medium label do not listen it, and release with small label is just  like to upload yourself on socials so imho is not worth it.

I've  readed a lot of ""how to send demo"" and things like that, even if i  never needed in the past i've already released a ton of music, but in 6  years the world is changed completly, seems socials numbers are more  important than music quality, i understand labels are business company  and it worth more to invest on well known man instead of someone who  have just few followers, and i don't wanna open a moral topic about  that, but this is kind of frustrating, i'm a music producer not a  ""socialmediaman"" i've made some profile but they are new, i'm not a  spammer and i don't wanna be, so numbers are ridicoulus.

Since  i believe my music worth it, and what i'm doing right now is even  better in what i've done in the past i'm considering to use a  distributor like distrokids (if you have other suggestions feel free to  share) and release it myself, but we are again, i'm no one so if i'll  release just now no one will notice my song, i've read about submithub  and i still did not understood if is a scam or legit, but after this i  don't really know how to promote myself, since as i understood the goal  is to have engaged followers on socials and spotify.

I'm  discouraged because what i really want is make music and let people to  listen it, if it was possible i whould do it for free i don't really  care about making money or became famous i'm not a dj and i have a job,  but as an artist i wanna share my feelings and my vibes with music to  most people possible, but right now seems impossible",8,,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/fgu2bx/back_to_the_music_but_discouraged/,Back to the music but discouraged,back to the music but discouraged,"  Hello  everyone i've produced edm music from 2002 till 2014 than i had to  stop, and now i'm back craving to do good music, and after 6 years i  have a lot of ideas and that's a bless.

fbumae,1583072255.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,seizure_machine,"For the past 3 months, my band has been utilizing and tracking different marketing strategies to promote our music. Here are the results","(All the NOTES are my opinion)

**Reddit**

Posting our music video to different subreddits:

* /r/Videos (22.3M members) : +200 youtube views, down-voted to oblivion, negative feedback
* /r/listenToThis (15.6M members) : +1k youtube views, several comments and a couple of fans, more spotify listens since we were added to a listentothis playlist
* /r/Animation(148K members) (One of our music videos was an animation) : +15 views, no feedback
* /r/trippy (106K members) (The animation music video was a psychedelic horror cartoon) : +40 views, positive feedback
* /r/gamemusic (87K members) : (we have a video game boss battle song) +10 views, no feedback
* /r/nerdcore (2.8K members) : +30 views,  positive feedback, comment from someone asking to collaborate with us

Total: +1300 views on 2 youtube music videos

Notes: It seems like promoting on Reddit gives decent results depending on your niche. The more specific the subreddit and the closer to your genre, the more positive the feedback seems to be. The bigger the subreddit the more potential the views, but the more ""mass appeal"" your music has to be for listeners to enjoy it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Instagram**

* Engaging (following, commenting, liking, messaging) with other fans of artists with music similar to ours : +364 new followers since December
* Paid promotion on music video post (100 $) : 9724 impressions , 215 visits to IG profile, 58 website clicks (music video), +4 followers
* Participating in a big channel's music contest (We won the Epic Rap Battles of history remix contest. ERB has about 130K followers, they created a post about us) : +17 followers

Total: +385 followers

Notes: Genuinely engaging with other fans of artists similar to your niche and being a part of similar communities seems to be the best way I have found (and free!) to acquire devoted fans. The only downside is that it is very time-consuming.

&amp;#x200B;

**Youtube (releasing content)**

* Music video 1 : +34 Subscribers
* Epic Rap Battles of History remix contest video: +8 Subscribers
* Live performance video 1 : +2 subscribers
* Live performance video 2 : + 2 subscribers
* Video Game Remix lyric video: -1 subscriber
* Lyric video : 0 subscribers
* Music video 2 : +16 subscribers

Total: +61 new subscribers

Notes: Our youtube content has not been consistent at all and we average about a video every 1-2 months. But it seems like a consistent and regular release schedule can really build a youtube audience.

&amp;#x200B;

**SubmitHub**

* payed 25 $ for 30 credits
* ~~17 people sent to, 12 responses, all declined~~
* 20 people sent to, 14 responses, 1 accepted

\*\*\*EDIT: just got my first submission accepted! Hooray\*\*\*

Notes: I've heard some people have success with submithub, but I think since our music is very experimental it is difficult to get shared by bloggers or influencers. Most curators available said they were not inclined to approve comedy music.

&amp;#x200B;

**Online Press**

* Miami New Times article on our music video release party: difficult to quantify how many people showed up to the show because of the article. We got about 60 Spotify streams though
* Miami New Times top 20 Miami songs of 2019 article: +100 Spotify streams, +7 Spotify followers
* Online Blog post about our music video: +300 youtube views on music video

Total: 160 Spotify streams, 7 Spotify followers and about 300 youtube views

&amp;#x200B;

**Live Shows**

* We play about 4 small (10 - 100 audience) shows a month, we average about 10 new fans per concert
* Total (Rough estimate) for 3 months: +120 new fans (IG follows, FB likes, Email list, etc)

Notes: our biggest fans and supporters have come from our live shows since it is a personal experience and it gives us a chance to connect with the audience at a deeper level than through the internet. We usually get great feedback and very devoted fans from our live shows.

&amp;#x200B;

**Our current numbers:**

IG followers: 1365

Facebook followers: 570

Youtube subscribers: 165

Monthly Spotify listeners: 133

&amp;#x200B;

Since our music is a mix of hip hop, comedy, electronic, Latin and experimental it is sometimes hard to find our target audience; listeners usually love or hate our music, there is no in-between. Our best results have come from engaging with fans of artists who's music has some intersect with ours, and playing live shows.

I have a relative who has been kind enough to offer to fund whatever promotion I need. I only want to use the funds I absolutely *need* to. I have a cousin who is a bigger figure in the music industry with some connections that may be valuable if he doesn’t ghost me like he often does.

I plan on/am working on:
- Creating Youtube/Vertical Instagram TV Video (I have applied to Spotify Canvas)
- Using Facebook/Instagram ad promotion
- Using SubmitHub for blogs and other playlists
- Contacting labels about an album when the tracks release
- Joining a PRO or publishing administrator (recommend some if you could🤔), getting synch licenses, InStore Media Play &amp; SoundExchange
- Creating merchandise for the release
I have:
- Submitted to about 25 music blogs
- Submitted to Spotify’s editorial playlists
- Created a smarturl link with a private soundcloud link that will activate for the public upon release

f6dzd8,1582133095.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,Aura_Blaze_Official,What is the proper etiquette for song premiere on a blog? (First-timer here),"Hey guys! I was hoping someone could shed some light on the proper etiquette for having a song premiere on a blog. I submitted my new single to a number of blogs via SubmitHub for a premiere request and, despite a good deal of rejections, I heard back from one who is interested in doing a premiere for it. 

My question is, how does this work in terms of allowing other blogs to review the song as well? I understand that the whole point of a premiere is for that one particular blog to be the go-to source for people to hear it for the first time, but how does this affect a musician's ability to keep promoting it to other blogs? I also heard back from a different blog who wants to share it (not premiere). And is it acceptable to specify to the blog doing the premiere that you would like them to use the Spotify link in the article instead of the secret Soundcloud link that you originally provided them with (since I'm trying to grow on Spotify and not focusing as much on Soundcloud)? I would also obviously be posting my Spotify/Bandcamp/Apple Music/whatever links on my social media on the day of release... Surely a blog wouldn't be offended by that or see it as stepping on their toes in terms of driving people to their page for the premiere? Should I wait a day or two to post up those links and post theirs up first? Any help at all in regards to the aforementioned would be very much appreciated!

2. They get too many horrible submissions, meaning hitting the decline button becomes a subconscious decision before they even get a chance to listen. 

3. You’re only using submit hub because you’re lazy. You can compile a much more effective list of Spotify playlist on your own.

4. My genre is Contemporary R&amp;B. When I search for playlist in contemporary R&amp;B, all I see is, “This curator has approved 12000 songs and 10 of them are R&amp;B”. If this is a not a big red flag then I don’t know what is. 

I NEED PLAYLIST WHO ONLY POST R&amp;B. Submithub does not find these playlists for me. It’s too broad. SubmitHub does NOT know what kind of music you make. Only you (as the artist) will know which playlist will likely be interested in your song. Which is why you have to search manually!

We spoke quite a bit about playlist organisation, using platforms such as SubmitHub for submissions, using platforms such as Reddit to share playlists and how people should approach one another on the web.

As some of you likely use playlist submissions as part of your marketing strategy for new music, I figured some of you may find this podcast of interest.

ewmkex,1580466729.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,Megalmodas,The do's and dont's of Submithub (according to me ;),"Hey guys,

just thought I share that with you as it might help you a bit with your submithub submissions.

I can give you two perspectives here as I'm a musician / artist (check out ""Megalmodas"" on the various platforms if your interested), and also have a small outlet on Submithub, Radio Dark Tunnel (Shellshocked Radio).

So I can look at the thing from two different sides, at least in my small, limited perspective.

As an artist, I basically see two ways you can use Submithub. If you do not want to spent any money, you can use the 2 free credits and basically throw your stuff on the wall and see what might stick.

I do this actually quite regulary, as these credits are free, and even had some mild success with it.

The biggest one so far has been being played in a radio station in Mexico and making it on a 7k Spotify playlist.

Also, if you have access to your Spotify Artist page, which you definetly should have, you see some streams from the outlets you have submitted your music to from all over the world (if you use the Spotify link on Submithub). So thats a few extra streams as well.

As for the paid (premium) credits, there has been a lengthly article written by another person here, which pointed out how much he researched all the outlets and such, I unfortunately forgot to save it, but basically he very detailed described the metrics and methods he used to research the outlets he wanted to target. Try to find it, it is very good written and helpful!

And I just can confirm that, as I, on the receiving end (Radio Dark Tunnel ) get quite annoyed by music which is completely wrong for my outlet. Your basically throwing away your money here, so please do not do that. I had 4 people blacklisted so far, which were pestering me with really bad (for my subjective taste of course) music. 

Here I can only talk for myself of course, but I wan't to find new music I enjoy listening to, so sending me crap over and over again, even though I have told you not to do that, I'm not gonna waste my time on you anymore.

Here I can also clear up some misconception. I'm not doing that for getting rich. I have a very narrow roster of genres (Gothic, Darkwave and Industrial) and earn about 20 dollars a month, with my outlet.

If you calculate the time I spent on this (listening, curating playlists, producing the radio show, archiving, communication with the artists) I think I make about 1 to 2 dollars per hour, and trust me, I have a family, hobbies and a full time job. This I do just for fun.

I personally also make no real difference between a premium submission or a free one, I will listen to both attentivly.

The greatest thing I get out of this is that it makes me able to connect with artists world wide, this is awesome! That's why I do it, and I truly love to discover new music.

As for premium credits, if you use them, I would advise you to take the ""90 seconds"" play option.

Most of the songs I receive are well done and crafted, and the artist put weeks or even month in its creation. So I'm unsure of what constructive feedback I should give to the artist after he / she laboured so long on it. I do not think someone would change a bassline, because I say that I do not like it.

So this a bit silly in my eyes. When I have to give feeback, I tell you what I like and what I don't, but what real worth does it bring to an artist to get feedback from a random stranger as me?

For a song which has been polished for months? Would you really change anything on it?

Especially with my channel, where I do clearly not care about what is en vogue at the moment. Either I like it or I don't ... ;)

What clearly improves your chances of getting picked by me or getting at least two listens is, if you show me in your statement, that you deliberately handpicked my channel and have familiarized yourself with the style and genres I'm looking for.

One band offered to wash my car (I do not own one ...) when I would approve their song. I found that very funny and approved their song. Don't get me wrong, I'm not telling you to bribe the outlets you try to get into, just telling you to be creative and funny if you can muster that.

Try to find a common ground / relationship with the outlet / person you sending your stuff to.

Most of the outlets receive tons of submissions, here you can stand out a bit.

Another thing, and this is once again just me of course, some nice Cover artwork will definetly catch my eye.

Sometimes I receive photoshopped cell phone pictures a seemingly 5 year old artist had thrown together ... unbelievable ... yes, creative freedom and all that, but just think about it if you would approach a major label with that cover, and then do a reality check, just trying to help here.

Okay, I wanted to say a few more things, but this post is already that long, and I don't really know if someone likes to read all of this, so I'm gonna stop now.

If you have any questions, just post them, I'll answer them as good as I can.

Hopefully some of you might find my rambelings useful.

We make alternative rock music mostly with 90s vibe, and have a release coming up in a month which is a bit more commercial rock. Looking at places to get it out there, and have contacted a few PR places who came back with $3500 as a price to do the promo for us. Thats a bit of a stretch for us money wise, so trying to do it all ourselves.

We've done the submithub route, which we've gotten good coverage on, but it hasn't really translated to a fan base. A few playlists put us on Spotify, and its all well and good but its not really translating. We're gigging a fair bit, but again, its not really translating to fan base.

Any solid advice you have to help us level up in any way would be much appreciated. Can send the soundcloud link also if you want to have a listen.

So I've just released a new track as part of my ambient project. I normally use Submithub and use the premium credits; I've had a good response rate (about 20 submissions and 6/7 accepted), managed to get on some biggish playlists, around 3k, or 4k followers.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm looking for new sites to push to playlists? I tried PlaylistPush (I don't want to spend $300+)! But, then I found a few sites like SoundPlate that ask you to follow certain people and playlists for a free submission.  


But! They ask for a huge access into your spotify? This feels very uncomfortable to me. But its asking for:

 **Take actions in Spotify on your behalf**    

* Add and remove items in Your Library                     
* Create, edit, and follow playlists                     
* Manage who you follow on Spotify

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone had experience of allowing these kind of permissions before? Its it something I shouldn't be worried about? Just I think soon as I accept permissions, Soundplate will spam my account to follow hundreds of playlists and follows!",1,,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/ei1gq4/soundplate_and_other_playlist_submission_sites/,"Soundplate (...and other Playlist submission sites) Requesting ""Access"" to my Spotify","soundplate (...and other playlist submission sites) requesting ""access"" to my spotify","Hi All, So I've just released a new track as part of my ambient project.

If yes then for god sakes Please help me figure out what SUB GENRE these are considered Lmao. That is all. 😆🎵","If you like these please let me know, I actually think they are terrible in my opinion, just because I have heard each of them well over 100 times back to back and self doubt on many of the adjustments or sounds. I think i lost my hearing while trying to teach myself to properly mix and master haha.

However This is more for a learning experience than an actual promotion as I' am quiet aware the quality and sound just is not up to par so do not think I am trying to boost these as some quality tracks or something.I would think that this is not the best work at all, however I think that it is a step up in my mastering compared to my first releases on soundcloud lmao.

Ive recently been submitting my tracks to Submithub and the feedback is hilarious. One person will say the highs are too high and the next person says the highs are beautiful, mix down is clean and they loved how well it was mastered etc etc however the next comment literally will say this is a terrible mix down the samples are horrible the mastering needs work etc.

In the same comments I get told this is not Dubstep. This is Trap. Then I get told This is not Trap. This is Trance, Then people in the Trance community tell me this is Not trance. This is House,....ok but now i get people saying its not House. Not Drum and Bass. This is not fucking brazilian slap house or some stupid shit i accidentally put. (Oh did i ever get shit on for that mistake lol)

When I posted in a subreddit today after the majority of people on submit hub telling me it was drum and bass and the most reviews came from people who listen to drum and bass, the subreddit shit on me for posting my song there saying its not drum and Bass. Ive asked over 20 people producing music online and no one can give me a straight answer or how they could even back it up.

I have elements from several genres and just need a label/title to put them under so I can actually hit the right market. Thank you in advanced for taking any time to read this, listen to the tracks, provide any feedback or comments.

So I recently got on two playlists through SubmitHub which was cool. Around the same time I found a Fiverr promotion for someone to run ads and do SEO for songs. There was no promise of listens or anything so I thought it was safe and not a scam. The guy even has one review that sticks out to me of a customer complaining saying “I didn’t get a bunch of listens” and the Fiverr guy saying back to him “I never promised you’d get listens I just put it in front of people”. 

Since I did the promotion I’ve gotten a lot of streams but it seems a bit sketchy. Most of them came from Phoenix, Arizona. And a lot of them came from a playlist with only 1 follower. I asked the guy about this and he said one of the keywords he uses does really well in Phoenix and he didn’t really answer the playlist question.  

I feel pretty bad about this cuz I feel like I’m being dishonest and may be a fraud even though I wasn’t trying to do anything that wasn’t legitimate.

Luckily, he was and after exchanging Instagram handles, we started to talk about the game we were on and we might be working together soon.

Another one was when I got too excited about making beat packs and ended up saying on the discord that I might get a placement with NBA YoungBoy (I was only making a pack).

Another producer got talking to me about producing and placements and he invited me to another Discord called Young Gods (a kit-selling website like WavSupply but more indie)

This was back in May and since then, I have joined their family of producers and have some sample kits being worked on.

Tips for Networking:

* Make sure to take every opportunity you can to know people, even if it's through gaming or here. I got one of my first rappers through the comments of a MHH thread.

* Don't just start off with ""Check out my post/song"". Let it be natural and start talking about something that both parties are interested in.

* Sometimes, you can use your heritage for networking as that is something that they could both relate to.

I actually met an indie artist (not hip-hop though) through SubmitHub's chat and successfully networked based on the fact that both of us were Scottish and he now wants me to remix one of his upcoming songs.

e10jum,1574612562.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,webren,Finally Got Accepted on SubmitHub - My Strategy,"Hi everyone, I see a lot of posts around SubmitHub and the frustration with trying to get an acceptance. After submitting a handful of times over the past few months, I finally got some acceptances. I wanted to share my strategy in case it can be helpful for you all.

**Previous Approach** I submitted previous singles on SubmitHub taking a bit of a shotgun approach, thinking it was a numbers game. ""If I submit this song to these 30 bloggers, one of them has to say yes"". That's unfortunately not true and it's the approach I took the first few submissions. What's needed is to take the time to curate a list of bloggers who 1) have accepted a lot songs of your genre and 2) have a decent acceptance rate.

**New Strategy** In support of my upcoming album release, I decided to try this strategy: 

* Filter out ""Really Good Bloggers"" from my search criteria. These bloggers are super picky because a lot of them write a review or detailed thoughts for every song post. So the acceptance rate is very low.
* Filter bloggers that accepted at least 100 songs in the genre of the song I was submitting (in this case, Synthwave). This metric was at the bottom of every blogger info summary. If a blogger accepted more than 100 Synthwave songs, that signaled to me that they were a fan of the genre and I'd have higher chances.
* Filter bloggers that have a reasonable acceptance rate. I chose above 20% as a starting benchmark.
* Once I found a blogger that I thought could be a good fit for the submission, I went and listened to the last 5 songs they posted to ensure that they've been recently approving similar songs to mine. This is key because bloggers will go through different musical moods and may be in the mood for something different. For ex, there was one blogger who normally posted Synthwave, but their last 5 posts were House and they explicitly wrote about how they've been on a House kick. For that blogger, it's best not to submit now given they're in a House mood as my music doesn't fit that genre.
* Use premium credits only - shows you're serious and bloggers will be more thoughtful.
* I recommend selecting the no feedback option and choose the 90 second listening option. You want the blogger to listen to as much of the song as possible, and by the time you're submitting, your song should be ready for commercial release anyway. 
* Write a blurb in the submission about how you'll market the song or release yourself. Bloggers want traffic, so take time to mention about how you'll be playing the song live, will post the blog post on your web presence, etc.

**Results** For this song submission, my song got picked up by 2 blogs and was added to 2 Spotify playlists, with a total of 4 acceptances out of 10 submissions. The acceptance rate range across the 4 was between 30-60%. So these guys don't accept just anyone, but they were flexible and open enough that I thought I had a shot. After the posts, I've received a significant increase in streams across many platforms, so the time spent plugging away was worth it.

Hope this was helpful!",44,,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/e10jum/finally_got_accepted_on_submithub_my_strategy/,Finally Got Accepted on SubmitHub - My Strategy,finally got accepted on submithub - my strategy,"Hi everyone, I see a lot of posts around SubmitHub and the frustration with trying to get an acceptance.

e0z2s0,1574605313.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,VallasC,A Few Words On First Releases And Becoming An Artist,"Hey all,

At the end of 2017 I did my first musical project with an artist I had met at a local coffee shop. I was only 17 at the time, and he was mid 20s and had been doing music for his whole life. One session turned into 2, 3, and shortly by the next year, 100. I had never really known if music was something I wanted to do, I was definitely interested in it but never really thought it was something I could do. He did most of the chords, he sang the tracks, I really just did drum and bass (midi, I can't play any instruments), and I wrote the lyrics. 

After the first song was released, I grew hungrier and hungrier for more of that musical satisfaction. I wrote the song but I didn't sing it and it wasn't a genre I'd ever listen to, so I wanted more control. Six months later we've got a band, we're playing the biggest venues in town, and we're making music that I'm not only writing but actually like listening to.

All this came from him desperately asking me to have more involvement and stick to what I was doing. He's an awesome artist himself but he wanted to push me, as I'm just a kid with really no experience. As time went on though, I noticed that most of the band really didn't want it as much as I did. There was this weird casual-ness to everyones personality. They were all musicians playing since they were born, but they only wanted to gig once every two months (despite us being able to be booked weekly), and no-one was making anything anymore. We ended up playing the hottest spot in town, got a bunch of publicity, and they pretty much decided we'd disband. I was really heartbroken. I went from 0 - Hero in what felt like a year in a half. I didn't even want to do music before I met those guys, and I worked my way up from producer and songwriter to lead singer. Now it's all gone?

Last Friday I put out my very first solo release. The original idea came from a scratch I made around the time I met the guys, and I finally transformed it into something I thought was totally me, an R&amp;B Pop track. I used submithub and reddit mostly for marketing, and within 7 days I got around 2,000 plays on Spotify! This totally eclipsed anything I've done with my band, and seeing that I could do it all myself with the drive and passion I found just a few years ago really continues to inspire me everyday.

I'm not sure if this kind of post is okay here, I just wanted to share some words from a kid who just really started :) I'm inspired by you guys everyday and have been lurking here for years.

* their playlist followers jumped from 13000 to 20000 within a week and barely changed afterwards

Thanks in advance","i submitted a song to a playlister on submithub. they did give me verbal (positive) feedback and added the song to the playlist, so all normal so far. it was a pretty big playlist (13000 listeners) so i was quite excited.  a few weeks later they share the song. here the anomalies that i thought are suspicious  * their playlist followers jumped from 13000 to 20000 within a week and barely changed afterwards they got removed from submithub, can't find any reason why anywhere  my song got a few hundred plays, but the amount of listeners is precisely the same as the amount of listeners. i have never experienced that at any other playlist, regardless of size  also, after a few days with very high daily playcounts suddenly the plays from the playlist stopped coming in, although the song remains in the playlist it is a playlist tied to a label, but there is very limited info on the label. most other artists in the playlist are very small, are released by the label, and the majority of their listener count is coming from the playlist  is it just me or is the case pretty clear? what do i do? on the reporting button on spotify there are only complaints possible regarding copyright/offensive content. also, worst case, can this have any negative consequences for me? has anyone else made experiences with that?  thanks in advance",15,235

I would love some advice on our music and how to proceed with reaching out to people.

We are an independent band and have been contacting lots of bookers, blogs and PR within the industry, specific to the genres of Hip Hop or Alternative Rock. Using services like submithub, humanhuman &amp; also networking and grinding emails. 

Nearly everyone has responded by telling us we are ""*too Hip Hop, try somewhere more suited for Hip Hop*"" or we are ""*too rock/alternative, try somewhere more suited for bands with guitars*""

We pride ourselves on sitting somewhere between Hip Hop, Rock, Jazz &amp; Pop, also taking a punk/DIY approach to what we do, something we feel Hip Hop has always been anyway.

Do y'all have any tips for promoting yourself online?

I know using social media is a big factor. I often use Twitter and Instagram. But my dilema is that I don't post enough.

I don't go out much. SO there's not much to post on my IG. And I'm pretty sure people don't wanna see the same photos of my work station. I know that photos with people get a lot of interactions. But I want people to know me for my music, ya know. Not for my face or whatever.

As for Twitter, that's just another story. I've been told (and I've seen for myself) that Twitter only works if you're famous. There have been times when I tweeted all the time. And no one would pay attention to my stuff.

I would love some advice on our music and how to proceed with reaching out to people.

We are an independent band and have been contacting lots of bookers, blogs and PR within the industry, specific to the genres of Hip Hop or Alternative/Psych Rock. Using services like submithub, humanhuman &amp; also networking and grinding emails. Nearly everyone has responded by telling us we are ""too Hip Hop, try somewhere more suited for Hip Hop"" or we are ""too rock/alternative, try somewhere more suited for bands with guitars""

We pride ourselves on sitting somewhere between Hip Hop, Rock, Acid Jazz &amp; Pop, also taking a punk/DIY approach to what we do, something we feel geetar music has always been anyway.

My question is do you feel the same as the industry people we have reached out to so far? Do you know any similar artists to us? Do you feel there is space for us in the Psych Rock sonisphere?

# SubmitHub

**How it works**

You buy premium credits which cost roughly $1 per credit. There are different packages but basically the more you buy the more discount you get. You can then use these credits to submit your song to blogs/playlist curators/labels to listen and they will decide whether to share it or not. Typically it will cost 1 credit per submission, with a few blogs/curators that charge up to 2 or 3 credits because they are of higher quality (this can mean a variety of different things but typically it's because their reach/audience is higher or they provide better feedback etc). Your credit is spent whether or not they share the song, but they are required to give you feedback if your song is rejected. There is a lot of info on the site about the bloggers you can submit to, including but not limited to their approval rate, their audience count and sources, the songs that they recently shared, etc. It should be noted that there is a free credit system where you receive 2 credits per day (can not be accumulated) I believe. Some blogs take free credits but IMO any blog worth submitting to usually would only take premium credits.

**My experience**

When I first discovered SubmitHub I was ecstatic that this platform existed to directly connect artists with curators/bloggers. I explored the site and everything seemed straight forward enough. So I purchased a bunch of credits, filtered the blogs based on the genre of my newly released track and started submitting away. I did this for a couple days and the results started coming in. I think I submitted to over 100 curators (combination of premium and free credits but mostly premium) and of the ones that responded not one wanted to share my song. That's right - 100 rejections.

At this point I was quite discouraged to say the least and was tempted to give up. Perhaps my music wasn't good enough or my genre of music just wasn't a big hit on the site. Ultimately though I decided to take this as a learning experience rather than surrendering. I did some more research, reading some SubmitHub success stories and tips (the site has its own resource link for tips). I took in all the feedback with an accepting mentality and aimed to improve my own craft based on the criticism. I realized that the average approval rate of the site is quite low at 11%. My own 0% approval was even lower,  but knowing that it's a tough field to begin with was actually encouraging to me, since there is more of a chance it's not my music that completely sucks. Most importantly, I learned that I didn't do enough research on the curators I submitted to.

As mentioned above, there is a lot of info about the curators that I completely overlooked. I only filtered out the genres and started submitting. Here's the thing about genres - there is a ton on the site for you to choose from and I find that a lot of times they are interpretive. For example ""Commercial"" music can mean one thing to someone and something else to another. What I started to do was go through the list of curators one by one. I listened to their recently shared tracks. I listened to more songs on their actual playlists. I also took into account their approval rate. There are curators that actually approve 100% of their submissions, which are ones you might want to avoid because the quality of their lists/listeners may be questionable. And then there are curators that have below 1% approval rate, reflecting how tough their standards are. I filtered the curators down to the ones with around 15% - 30% approval rate because I wanted my song submitted to quality lists but at the same time have a fighting chance. The priority though is making sure my song is a good fit with that of the curator's list. After many hours of research, my shortlist of curators was at around 20. And so I launched a submission campaign with this more fine tuned list. After a couple days all my results came in. Of the 20 submissions, 15 responded, and 8 approved my track to be shared/added on their playlist. 5 credits refunded to me. I was stoked. That's over 50% that approved my track, which is actually higher than the overall average and miles ahead of my original campaign. Now the range of quality of the shares was quite broad. Most were quite good, adding my song to lists with hundreds of listeners and some cases thousands. There was a curator though that added my song to a playlist with 2 listeners. Whatever. Coming from 100 rejections I took every approval/share as a big win. Also kept in mind that any playlist add is good for the Spotify algorithm and helps with chances of getting your song added to an editorial playlist which in my mind is the ultimate goal.

&amp;#x200B;

# PlaylistPush

**How it Works**

You launch a campaign by first submitting your already released Spotify track to see if it qualifies. I think it takes at most one day for them to get back to you. Once they approve your track you can get started (I imagine it is very rare that they will reject your track for a campaign). You start by typing in some similar artists to yourself and some genres will be assigned to your song. You can modify these genres (subtracting what they assigned or adding some that they missed). Once you are happy with classifying your song into the genres, the next step is selecting the budget for your song. 3 options are offered: ""Precise"", ""Accurate"", ""Broad"". Here is a screenshot of what it looks like.

&amp;#x200B;

[PlaylistPush campaign packages](https://preview.redd.it/pq3jx9bae3m31.jpg?width=795&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=665da86cf41af5e8a93e2289eab997ce1c70c474)

The pricing is dependent on the genre of your song. Some genres are more expensive than others depending on how many curators they have. You're looking at this right - it's quite pricey. From the PlaylistPush site itself, ""The average campaign cost is around $450. However, pricing can range from as low as $250 to $1,000+ depending on which genres and matching you select."" After all is done and finalized you just wait 2 weeks for all your results to come in.

**My Experience**

You will see in the image that there is a small button at the bottom ""More Price Options."" From there I was able to select the cheapest campaign possible at $202.50 (everyone's budget is different, but I just don't have several hundred dollars to easily spare). For that price my song was submitted to 19 playlists. After I finalized the campaign there was nothing else to do but wait for the results. You have no control over which curators your song goes to and there is no info about the curators and their playlists. You just have to trust the site's algorithm to send your song the right curators in terms of genre matching. The whole process has a much more ""automated"" feel. If you do the math, that's approximately $10.65 per submission which is 10 times more expensive than SubmitHub. Now if you go with the more expensive packages, the price per submission does goes down. But nevertheless still not very cheap to say the least. The important question is if it's worth it. These were my results: 10 curators added my song while 9 rejected it. All came back with some brief feedback as that's what's required. All the playlist adds were on decent lists with at least several hundred followers. Results will definitely vary from song to song but 10 out of 19 was something I was quite happy with.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion

One thing I want to clarify is that this isn't a ""versus"" type comparison review where I choose a winner among the two. I think both platforms have its merits. If you only look at my results though, you will see that I was able to spend $15 on SubmitHub to get 8 playlist adds (not counting the first $100 I spent not knowing how to properly utilize the site), and on PlaylistPush I spent $202.50 for 10 playlist adds. So does SubmitHub have way more value? Not necessarily. Keep in mind that along with the $15, I spent hours and hours researching curators to come up with my shortlist to submit to. One hour can be worth a lot depending on who you talk to. Moreover, every hour doing something else (like researching curators) is one less hour for you to work on creating music. For PlaylistPush I just filled out a digital form and hit ""go"". So even though you can say PlaylistPush is way more pricey, I believe the extra premium is for the convenience, time saved, and more of a guarantee on the playlist quality. I would say that PlaylistPush has a higher bar for their pool of curators and playlists in terms of number of followers and active listeners. SubmitHub on the other hand is all over the place with that. You might get scenarios where some curators are actually primarily music bloggers that happen to have a playlist with a few followers. To be fair though SubmitHub is very transparent with that and provides sufficient data for you to make an informed decision. Honestly, I think that for all the data and info you can obtain from SubmitHub, $1 per submission is dirt cheap. It is up to you to assess all that data though.

So if you have a limited budget and lots of time and energy to spare, I'd say give SubmitHub a shot. If you have a higher marketing budget and don't have much free time, PlaylistPush can be a good tool for you. How long your track stays on the approved playlists is entirely up to the curator but I believe the minimum is one week. How rewarding these campaigns are will vary case by case. You will definitely see a spike in monthly listeners if you get a few playlist adds but when your song eventually gets taken down it's hard to say if you can maintain that momentum. During this time of exposure gaining new followers and track saves will be key stats to look out for IMO. For me it worked out quite well as my track got saved a few hundred times and that's a lot for me.

&amp;#x200B;

# Why they are not a scam

I've seen the words ""scam"" and ""payola"" thrown around a lot. Usually from people who have had a bad experience with the sites or from people who don't really know the basic concept of the platforms. Based on the definition of payola, the fact that there are so many rejections among both sites is already an indication they are not that. As for the label ""scam"", this is mostly from people who used the sites and didn't get the results they wanted (ie. got rejected a lot). If you read through the documentation and FAQs on the sites, they are very upfront with what to expect if you use the platform. SubmitHub clearly states that the average approval rate is quite low (at 11%). Some people say the feedback quality is poor and some say they feel generic. Some say that they got good things said about their song but was rejected so that makes no sense. I'll be honest that I didn't care too much about that part because I was mainly focused on getting playlist shares. Here's the thing. These curators probably listen to hundreds or thousands of songs in a month. There's only so many ways to reject you or tell you that your song is not a good fit for their list and not necessarily because they don't like it. They have probably dealt with their fair share of artists with fragile egos and have learnt to be polite (maybe overly so) when giving you bad news. Hey I get it. I'm an artist too and it doesn't feel great when others tell you that your music is not good enough. It's very easy to fall into the trap of being defensive and projecting the blame on everything else but your own music. For me a scam is when there is an intent to cheat you somehow. When these sites are upfront and clear what you are walking into, I think everything is fair game.

&amp;#x200B;

That's all. I see that this has become quite a long post. I hope it helps those of you looking for more case studies of these platforms.

They have probably dealt with their fair share of artists with fragile egos and have learnt to be polite (maybe overly so) when giving you bad news. Hey I get it. I'm an artist too and it doesn't feel great when others tell you that your music is not good enough. It's very easy to fall into the trap of being defensive and projecting the blame on everything else but your own music. For me a scam is when there is an intent to cheat you somehow. When these sites are upfront and clear what you are walking into, I think everything is fair game. &x200B; That's all. I see that this has become quite a long post.

# SubmitHub

**How it works**

You buy premium credits which cost roughly $1 per credit. There are different packages but basically the more you buy the more discount you get. You can then use these credits to submit your song to blogs/playlist curators/labels to listen and they will decide whether to share it or not. Typically it will cost 1 credit per submission, with a few blogs/curators that charge up to 2 or 3 credits because they are of higher quality (this can mean a variety of different things but typically it's because their reach/audience is higher or they provide better feedback etc). Your credit is spent whether or not they share the song, but they are required to give you feedback if your song is rejected. There is a lot of info on the site about the bloggers you can submit to, including but not limited to their approval rate, their audience count and sources, the songs that they recently shared, etc. It should be noted that there is a free credit system where you receive 2 credits per day (can not be accumulated) I believe. Some blogs take free credits but IMO any blog worth submitting to usually would only take premium credits.

**My experience**

When I first discovered SubmitHub I was ecstatic that this platform existed to directly connect artists with curators/bloggers. I explored the site and everything seemed straight forward enough. So I purchased a bunch of credits, filtered the blogs based on the genre of my newly released track and started submitting away. I did this for a couple days and the results started coming in. I think I submitted to over 100 curators (combination of premium and free credits but mostly premium) and of the ones that responded not one wanted to share my song. That's right - 100 rejections.

At this point I was quite discouraged to say the least and was tempted to give up. Perhaps my music wasn't good enough or my genre of music just wasn't a big hit on the site. Ultimately though I decided to take this as a learning experience rather than surrendering. I did some more research, reading some SubmitHub success stories and tips (the site has its own resource link for tips). I took in all the feedback with an accepting mentality and aimed to improve my own craft based on the criticism. I realized that the average approval rate of the site is quite low at 11%. My own 0% approval was even lower,  but knowing that it's a tough field to begin with was actually encouraging to me, since there is more of a chance it's not my music that completely sucks. Most importantly, I learned that I didn't do enough research on the curators I submitted to.

As mentioned above, there is a lot of info about the curators that I completely overlooked. I only filtered out the genres and started submitting. Here's the thing about genres - there is a ton on the site for you to choose from and I find that a lot of times they are interpretive. For example ""Commercial"" music can mean one thing to someone and something else to another. What I started to do was go through the list of curators one by one. I listened to their recently shared tracks. I listened to more songs on their actual playlists. I also took into account their approval rate. There are curators that actually approve 100% of their submissions, which are ones you might want to avoid because the quality of their lists/listeners may be questionable. And then there are curators that have below 1% approval rate, reflecting how tough their standards are. I filtered the curators down to the ones with around 15% - 30% approval rate because I wanted my song submitted to quality lists but at the same time have a fighting chance. The priority though is making sure my song is a good fit with that of the curator's list. After many hours of research, my shortlist of curators was at around 20. And so I launched a submission campaign with this more fine tuned list. After a couple days all my results came in. Of the 20 submissions, 15 responded, and 8 approved my track to be shared/added on their playlist. 5 credits refunded to me. I was stoked. That's over 50% that approved my track, which is actually higher than the overall average and miles ahead of my original campaign. Now the range of quality of the shares was quite broad. Most were quite good, adding my song to lists with hundreds of listeners and some cases thousands. There was a curator though that added my song to a playlist with 2 listeners. Whatever. Coming from 100 rejections I took every approval/share as a big win. Also kept in mind that any playlist add is good for the Spotify algorithm and helps with chances of getting your song added to an editorial playlist which in my mind is the ultimate goal.

# PlaylistPush

**How it Works**

You launch a campaign by first submitting your already released Spotify track to see if it qualifies. I think it takes at most one day for them to get back to you. Once they approve your track you can get started (I imagine it is very rare that they will reject your track for a campaign). You start by typing in some similar artists to yourself and some genres will be assigned to your song. You can modify these genres (subtracting what they assigned or adding some that they missed). Once you are happy with classifying your song into the genres, the next step is selecting the budget for your song. 3 options are offered: ""Precise"", ""Accurate"", ""Broad"". Here is a screenshot of what it looks like.

&amp;#x200B;

[PlaylistPush campaign packages](https://preview.redd.it/06e37j2bc3m31.jpg?width=795&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5c4cd6eebb8cf8e05d71e2a1f3ba8a0898e4ebd)

The pricing is dependent on the genre of your song. Some genres are more expensive than others depending on how many curators they have. You're looking at this right - it's quite pricey. From the PlaylistPush site itself, ""The average campaign cost is around $450. However, pricing can range from as low as $250 to $1,000+ depending on which genres and matching you select."" After all is done and finalized you just wait 2 weeks for all your results to come in.

**My Experience**

You will see in the image that there is a small button at the bottom ""More Price Options."" From there I was able to select the cheapest campaign possible at $202.50 (everyone's budget is different, but I just don't have several hundred dollars to easily spare). For that price my song was submitted to 19 playlists. After I finalized the campaign there was nothing else to do but wait for the results. You have no control over which curators your song goes to and there is no info about the curators and their playlists. You just have to trust the site's algorithm to send your song the right curators in terms of genre matching. The whole process has a much more ""automated"" feel. If you do the math, that's approximately $10.65 per submission which is 10 times more expensive than SubmitHub. Now if you go with the more expensive packages, the price per submission does goes down. But nevertheless still not very cheap to say the least. The important question is if it's worth it. These were my results: 10 curators added my song while 9 rejected it. All came back with some brief feedback as that's what's required. All the playlist adds were on decent lists with at least several hundred followers. Results will definitely vary from song to song but 10 out of 19 was something I was quite happy with.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion

One thing I want to clarify is that this isn't a ""versus"" type comparison review where I choose a winner among the two. I think both platforms have its merits. If you only look at my results though, you will see that I was able to spend $15 on SubmitHub to get 8 playlist adds (not counting the first $100 I spent not knowing how to properly utilize the site), and on PlaylistPush I spent $202.50 for 10 playlist adds. So does SubmitHub have way more value? Not necessarily. Keep in mind that along with the $15, I spent hours and hours researching curators to come up with my shortlist to submit to. One hour can be worth a lot depending on who you talk to. Moreover, every hour doing something else (like researching curators) is one less hour for you to work on creating music. For PlaylistPush I just filled out a digital form and hit ""go"". So even though you can say PlaylistPush is way more pricey, I believe the extra premium is for the convenience, time saved, and more of a guarantee on the playlist quality. I would say that PlaylistPush has a higher bar for their pool of curators and playlists in terms of number of followers and active listeners. SubmitHub on the other hand is all over the place with that. You might get scenarios where some curators are actually primarily music bloggers that happen to have a playlist with a few followers. To be fair though SubmitHub is very transparent with that and provides sufficient data for you to make an informed decision. Honestly, I think that for all the data and info you can obtain from SubmitHub, $1 per submission is dirt cheap. It is up to you to assess all that data though.

So if you have a limited budget and lots of time and energy to spare, I'd say give SubmitHub a shot. If you have a higher marketing budget and don't have much free time, PlaylistPush can be a good tool for you. How long your track stays on the approved playlists is entirely up to the curator but I believe the minimum is one week. How rewarding these campaigns are will vary case by case.

# Why they are not a scam

I've seen the words ""scam"" and ""payola"" thrown around a lot. Usually from people who have had a bad experience with the sites or from people who don't really know the basic concept of the platforms. Based on the definition of payola, the fact that there are so many rejections among both sites is already an indication they are not that. As for the label ""scam"", this is mostly from people who used the sites and didn't get the results they wanted (ie. got rejected a lot). If you read through the documentation and FAQs on the sites, they are very upfront with what to expect if you use the platform. SubmitHub clearly states that the average approval rate is quite low (at 11%). Some people say the feedback quality is poor and some say they feel generic. Some say that they got good things said about their song but was rejected so that makes no sense. I'll be honest that I didn't care too much about that part because I was mainly focused on getting playlist shares. Here's the thing. These curators probably listen to hundreds or thousands of songs in a month. There's only so many ways to reject you or tell you that your song is not a good fit for their list and not necessarily because they don't like it. They have probably dealt with their fair share of artists with fragile egos and have learnt to be polite (maybe overly so) when giving you bad news. Hey I get it. I'm an artist too and it doesn't feel great when others tell you that your music is not good enough. It's very easy to fall into the trap of being defensive and projecting the blame on everything else but your own music. For me a scam is when there is an intent to cheat you somehow. When these sites are upfront and clear what you are walking into, I think everything is fair game.

&amp;#x200B;

That's all. I see that this has become quite a long post. I hope it helps those of you looking for more case studies of these platforms.

You will definitely see a spike in monthly listeners if you get a few playlist adds but when your song eventually gets taken down it's hard to say if you can maintain that momentum. During this time of exposure gaining new followers and track saves will be key stats to look out for IMO. For me it worked out quite well as my track got saved a few hundred times and that's a lot for me. &x200B;  Why they are not a scam I've seen the words ""scam"" and ""payola"" thrown around a lot. Usually from people who have had a bad experience with the sites or from people who don't really know the basic concept of the platforms. Based on the definition of payola, the fact that there are so many rejections among both sites is already an indication they are not that. As for the label ""scam"", this is mostly from people who used the sites and didn't get the results they wanted (ie. got rejected a lot). If you read through the documentation and FAQs on the sites, they are very upfront with what to expect if you use the platform. SubmitHub clearly states that the average approval rate is quite low (at 11%). Some people say the feedback quality is poor and some say they feel generic. Some say that they got good things said about their song but was rejected so that makes no sense. I'll be honest that I didn't care too much about that part because I was mainly focused on getting playlist shares. Here's the thing. These curators probably listen to hundreds or thousands of songs in a month. There's only so many ways to reject you or tell you that your song is not a good fit for their list and not necessarily because they don't like it. They have probably dealt with their fair share of artists with fragile egos and have learnt to be polite (maybe overly so) when giving you bad news. Hey I get it. I'm an artist too and it doesn't feel great when others tell you that your music is not good enough. It's very easy to fall into the trap of being defensive and projecting the blame on everything else but your own music. For me a scam is when there is an intent to cheat you somehow. When these sites are upfront and clear what you are walking into, I think everything is fair game. &x200B; That's all. I see that this has become quite a long post. I hope it helps those of you looking for more case studies of these platforms.

section where i give my opinion. i am only speaking from my own experience. i have read a lot of different views and cases from different people on this site with both good and bad experiences. this is just one more to add to those for reference, in hopes that it will help you guys make a more informed decision whether to use these services and how to approach using them. i am offering my opinion which may differ from others based on their experiences. it should also be noted that i only aimed to get my songs on playlists and didn't care much for blog features or feedback.  submithub **how it works** you buy premium credits which cost roughly $1 per credit. there are different packages but basically the more you buy the more discount you get. you can then use these credits to submit your song to blogs/playlist curators/labels to listen and they will decide whether to share it or not. typically it will cost 1 credit per submission, with a few blogs/curators that charge up to 2 or 3 credits because they are of higher quality (this can mean a variety of different things but typically it's because their reach/audience is higher or they provide better feedback etc). your credit is spent whether or not they share the song, but they are required to give you feedback if your song is rejected. there is a lot of info on the site about the bloggers you can submit to, including but not limited to their approval rate, their audience count and sources, the songs that they recently shared, etc. it should be noted that there is a free credit system where you receive 2 credits per day (can not be accumulated) i believe. some blogs take free credits but imo any blog worth submitting to usually would only take premium credits. **my experience** when i first discovered submithub i was ecstatic that this platform existed to directly connect artists with curators/bloggers. i explored the site and everything seemed straight forward enough. so i purchased a bunch of credits, filtered the blogs based on the genre of my newly released track and started submitting away. i did this for a couple days and the results started coming in. i think i submitted to over 100 curators (combination of premium and free credits but mostly premium) and of the ones that responded not one wanted to share my song. that's right - 100 rejections. at this point i was quite discouraged to say the least and was tempted to give up. perhaps my music wasn't good enough or my genre of music just wasn't a big hit on the site. ultimately though i decided to take this as a learning experience rather than surrendering. i did some more research, reading some submithub success stories and tips (the site has its own resource link for tips). i took in all the feedback with an accepting mentality and aimed to improve my own craft based on the criticism. i realized that the average approval rate of the site is quite low at 11%. my own 0% approval was even lower,  but knowing that it's a tough field to begin with was actually encouraging to me, since there is more of a chance it's not my music that completely sucks. most importantly, i learned that i didn't do enough research on the curators i submitted to. as mentioned above, there is a lot of info about the curators that i completely overlooked. i only filtered out the genres and started submitting. here's the thing about genres - there is a ton on the site for you to choose from and i find that a lot of times they are interpretive. for example ""commercial"" music can mean one thing to someone and something else to another. what i started to do was go through the list of curators one by one. i listened to their recently shared tracks. i listened to more songs on their actual playlists. i also took into account their approval rate. there are curators that actually approve 100% of their submissions, which are ones you might want to avoid because the quality of their lists/listeners may be questionable. and then there are curators that have below 1% approval rate, reflecting how tough their standards are. i filtered the curators down to the ones with around 15% - 30% approval rate because i wanted my song submitted to quality lists but at the same time have a fighting chance. the priority though is making sure my song is a good fit with that of the curator's list. after many hours of research, my shortlist of curators was at around 20. and so i launched a submission campaign with this more fine tuned list. after a couple days all my results came in. of the 20 submissions, 15 responded, and 8 approved my track to be shared/added on their playlist. 5 credits refunded to me. i was stoked. that's over 50% that approved my track, which is actually higher than the overall average and miles ahead of my original campaign. now the range of quality of the shares was quite broad. most were quite good, adding my song to lists with hundreds of listeners and some cases thousands. there was a curator though that added my song to a playlist with 2 listeners. whatever. coming from 100 rejections i took every approval/share as a big win. also kept in mind that any playlist add is good for the spotify algorithm and helps with chances of getting your song added to an editorial playlist which in my mind is the ultimate goal. &x200b;  playlistpush **how it works** you launch a campaign by first submitting your already released spotify track to see if it qualifies. i think it takes at most one day for them to get back to you. once they approve your track you can get started (i imagine it is very rare that they will reject your track for a campaign). you start by typing in some similar artists to yourself and some genres will be assigned to your song. you can modify these genres (subtracting what they assigned or adding some that they missed). once you are happy with classifying your song into the genres, the next step is selecting the budget for your song. 3 options are offered ""precise"", ""accurate"", ""broad"". here is a screenshot of what it looks like. &x200b; playlistpush campaign packages. for that price my song was submitted to 19 playlists. after i finalized the campaign there was nothing else to do but wait for the results. you have no control over which curators your song goes to and there is no info about the curators and their playlists. you just have to trust the site's algorithm to send your song the right curators in terms of genre matching. the whole process has a much more ""automated"" feel. if you do the math, that's approximately $10.65 per submission which is 10 times more expensive than submithub. now if you go with the more expensive packages, the price per submission does goes down. but nevertheless still not very cheap to say the least. the important question is if it's worth it. these were my results 10 curators added my song while 9 rejected it. all came back with some brief feedback as that's what's required. all the playlist adds were on decent lists with at least several hundred followers. results will definitely vary from song to song but 10 out of 19 was something i was quite happy with. &x200b;  conclusion one thing i want to clarify is that this isn't a ""versus"" type comparison review where i choose a winner among the two. i think both platforms have its merits. if you only look at my results though, you will see that i was able to spend $15 on submithub to get 8 playlist adds (not counting the first $100 i spent not knowing how to properly utilize the site), and on playlistpush i spent $202.50 for 10 playlist adds. so does submithub have way more value? not necessarily. keep in mind that along with the $15, i spent hours and hours researching curators to come up with my shortlist to submit to. one hour can be worth a lot depending on who you talk to. moreover, every hour doing something else (like researching curators) is one less hour for you to work on creating music. for playlistpush i just filled out a digital form and hit ""go"". so even though you can say playlistpush is way more pricey, i believe the extra premium is for the convenience, time saved, and more of a guarantee on the playlist quality. i would say that playlistpush has a higher bar for their pool of curators and playlists in terms of number of followers and active listeners. submithub on the other hand is all over the place with that. you might get scenarios where some curators are actually primarily music bloggers that happen to have a playlist with a few followers. to be fair though submithub is very transparent with that and provides sufficient data for you to make an informed decision. honestly, i think that for all the data and info you can obtain from submithub, $1 per submission is dirt cheap. it is up to you to assess all that data though. so if you have a limited budget and lots of time and energy to spare, i'd say give submithub a shot. if you have a higher marketing budget and don't have much free time, playlistpush can be a good tool for you. how long your track stays on the approved playlists is entirely up to the curator but i believe the minimum is one week. how rewarding these campaigns are will vary case by case. you will definitely see a spike in monthly listeners if you get a few playlist adds but when your song eventually gets taken down it's hard to say if you can maintain that momentum. during this time of exposure gaining new followers and track saves will be key stats to look out for imo. for me it worked out quite well as my

d2ot8f,1568202302.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,Megalmodas,My first day on Submithub and a big thank you to the Reddit Community,"Hello everyone,

a day ago I switched sites and are now as a Radio Show host on Submithub and I love it. 

There is so much great music out there, I feel overwhelmed by the sheer mass of submissions I get and I love most of it (half of it, if I read my statistics correctly ;)

I will need to pause the submissions a couple of times, as I really wanna listen to the songs, and best case scenario say something about them. 

But now I can understand that this is impossible, to treat all submissions equaly, as you get a ton in a sec.

So please do not feel discouraged when you submit something in Submithub, now I know as a fact that it happens that your not in the ""right mood"" or something like this, for a particular song and then just say ""no"" I try to save them for later, and listen to them again in a different state of mind ... but did I mentioned there is tons of music out there, so I do not really know when to do that ...

I try my best to be fair, but it will not always be so ... 

If you want to submit some music in as well, please send it via Submithub or send me a dm.

I will list all music I get and where I find a Spotify link in my Spotify Playlist: ""Shellshocked Radio - Discovery"", so if wanna help out with the reach there, please follow it and send it around in your social media. The list will grow a lot over the next few months, thats for sure.

And lastly I want to say thank you to Reddit. I've heard of Reddit years ago, but never joined ... until a month ago. 

In the one month I've learned more then in the last 5 years ... I've found submithub, I found a cool and oh so talented guitar player for my band here, and all of you and your insights, comments, help and tipps. I wished I would have joined much sooner.

So I'm about to release a new track in two weeks, and I'm wondering what are the best ways to promote the track? I've tried Facebook Ads and YouTube ads in the past and that gets a decent amount of views on YouTube, but it doesn't translate over to listeners or fans on digital streaming services.

Are there any methods you guys have tried to get more listeners on Spotify/Apple Music, etc, that have worked?  I considered trying Playlist Push, MusoSoup, and trying SubmitHub again (though it's never really worked for me in the past) but not sure if these were seen as 'scammy'. Context wise, my music would fall into pop/dance-pop category.

I'm a singer-songwriter and producer and I could really use some honest feedback on my latest release but please, give the track a chance as a whole.

cu7hwx,1566526678.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,webren,Preparing for Album Release to Maximize Exposure,"Hi everyone,

I'm about 2-3 months away from releasing my album, and I've been releasing singles on Spotify to help gather some buzz about the release. So far my fan base is friends and family, so my monthly listeners is minimal. I've been doing a lot of reading and trying to figure out how artists start and create fans and listens for their first release. Everything I read points to 1) keep submitting each single to Spotify playlist editors and cross your fingers 2) use a service like Playlist Push or Submithub to send your songs to playlist curators and bloggers and cross your fingers or 3) grind it out by personally emailing bloggers and playlist curators (if you can find them) to let them know about the release and see if they like what they hear.

1) is easy and I'm leaning toward 3) long-term given the things I've read regarding the very little ROI musicians get from the services like Playlist Push/Submithub. Is the best way really starting a marketing campaign 1-2 months before the release and start cold emailing and ramp up marketing through IG, Facebook, and beg friends to add me to their Spotify playlist (I read Spotify has algorithms that will add your song to their playlists if your song is popular across user playlists)?

What was your approach? Imagining releasing an album that I've worked hard on for 9 months to the Spotify ether with no listeners is quite sad, so I'd like to figure this out.

cr2jc2,1565937275.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,Megalmodas,Playlist Exchange,"Hey guys,

first of, I've learned a lot since I've joined here, and I'm grateful for all the advice.

I make music now for almost 30 years and slowly get the hang of it how to deal with Spotify and such ...

So I guess I'm not the first one to propose this, but having found all the services where you have to pay to get on playlists (submithub, bestsellermarket ...) I was wondering if we could not help each other joining our own playlists and slowly creating a following.

I'm not saying that we should blindly follow each other and put songs from each other in our respective playlists, but to hook up with artists and playlists you truly like and only follow them and / or put songs from them in your playlist.

No scamming and such.

So I would start by saying that I like (mostly) Industrial, Gothic, Darkwave and Electro and all around that.

So if you have something that fits in there, hit me up and I will check and see if it fits my playlist.

Likewise, if you have a playlist where some of my genres might fit, let me know and I will check it and follow it, and propose some songs of mine which might be ""missing"" in there.

I don't want to have this ""If I do that, you HAVE TO DO THAT FOR ME"" kind of thing. 

Only if you like something you should put it in your playlist and vice versa.

Does this make sense? Anyone would like to try that with me?

I also have some more Rock and Singer Songwriter Stuff btw. but Gothic / Industrial is my biggest interest.

Let me know if that is a stupid idea, or if it could work ...",1,,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/cr2jc2/playlist_exchange/,Playlist Exchange,playlist exchange,"Hey guys, first of, I've learned a lot since I've joined here, and I'm grateful for all the advice.

tl;dr: do more.   
Music has always been my passion, but having gone to University to study engineering and taken a full time job after a Masters, it had always remained something I would do for fun on the side. I would occasionally toss up some of the songs I produced on soundcloud just to show some friends, but never anything more. It wasn’t until November of last year that I decided to try to take my music seriously and launch a brand new Project. On November 23rd 2018, I essentially Beyonced an EP with no audience. 

8 Months later, I have been placed on 5 spotify editorial playlists, have over 140k Spotify Streams, and just signed my next upcoming single with Proximity. 

I know many of us here in this subreddit are in the camp of wanting to pursue this whole music thing, but due to whatever reason, are stuck working full time. I think way too many people use that as an excuse. There is absolutely no reason you can’t be pursuing your music, even while working a full time job.   
Here are some tips that I feel have helped me stay on track:   
**1. Prioritize.** 

One of my favorite mental exercises is to change the thought “I don’t have time for X” to “X is not a priority”. Not having time is bullshit. It’s not that you don’t have time, it’s just that work/sleep/anything else is a priority. Now I’m not suggesting you chug 6 red bulls and quit your job. (after all this is supposed to be tips on how to work on music while working a full time job) But the point is that if you start to look at how you are prioritizing your time, I guarantee you will find more time to make music. It may mean taking a day off the gym, staying in one night instead of going out with friends, or having Stranger Things Season 3 spoiled for you since you haven’t watched it yet. But the number one thing you can do to pursue your music while working full time, is spend more time pursuing it. (wowzers) So prioritize and find the time.   


**2. Be consistent.** 

Between a full time job and all the other responsibilities that come with real life, there is admittedly not an exorbitant amount of hours left in a given day to workday on your music. But even if you can only find a minimal amount of time, use it. Consistency is key. Here is a general walk through of my M-F.   
8-830. Wake up and get ready for Work.   
830-9. Commute to Work. \*While on the Tram I am often using it to grow my social media\*

9 - 6. Work. \*On My Lunch I will often spend some time DMing playlisters or emailing Blogs etc.\*  
6-6:30. Commute. \*Maybe I’ll listen to some podcasts about music marketing\*

6:30 - 7:30. Make and eat Dinner.   
7:30-9:30. Gym. I \*prioritize\* staying active since I work at a desk all day. I could easily cut this and spend more time on music but I don’t.   
9:30 - 10. Post workout meal and relax.   
10 - sleep. MUSIC.   
So after a long day, I generally can only get to music around 10. And by then I might only get 2-3 hours before I pass out. But guess what? 2 hours a day over 8 months =  60 full 8 hour working days. That’s the equivalent of *3 months* working full time on music. Working a little bit everyday adds up! Consistency is key.   


**3. Work Smart.** 

So I know you may be thinking “I can’t do anything in 2 hours,what’s the point of even opening my daw?” or “I can’t force creativity how am I supposed to be consistent?”. I used to think those exact 2 things. But guess what? There is always something to be done.

Go through and start organizing a project file so that when you go to mix everything’s named and bused properly. Maybe go through and start mixing that track that’s coming together but is mad muddy. Maybe go watch some sound design tutorials. Maybe go on splice and start building up some sample libraries. Maybe set-up that custom template you’ve been meaning to set up for 7 years. 

There is so much more to the music making process than actually just writing a song. So if you’re not in the mood to do A, spend those two hours doing B. After a even just a week of this, you’ll be so much further ahead than if you just gave up with the “I can’t do anything in 2 hours”. 

**4. (Bonus) No one is going to build your audience for you.** 

I used to be the king of “fuck music marketing. I just want to make good music. If I make good music it will find and audience.” But that’s just not true. One of my favorite things that was said to make me realize this was: “Take a USB with the world's best music and throw it into the forest. No one is finding it.” The internet is that forest. If you want people to hear your music you need to make that happen. So spend your lunch / time on your commute/ those 2 hours a day you might have on a day where you don’t feel like doing actual music: DMing, emailing, using the 1.80 cent method on instagram, use free tools like submithub, Spotify for Artists or Youtube channel submission portals to pitch your music. “Everybody says they're trying to get their piece of the pie. They don't realize that the world is a kitchen – you can make your own pie.” Terry Crews. 

**Now a word of Caution:** 

Pursuing music while working a full time job is hard. It takes commitment and dedication. Personally I have prioritized music over sleep far too many times and definitely found myself burnt out and depressed at the thought of the efforts I was making and the utter emptiness of the return. Take care of yourselves. Take time off when needed. But keep at it. 10 monthly listeners will turn into 100. 100 into 1000. It takes time but eventually you will get your first break onto a playlist. And then one day you’ll wake up and the mysterious Spotify algorithm will be pushing your latest release to 3k release radars for no explicable reason.    
I Hope these tips are helpful to someone or that this post can serve as a motivation to get up and make some music.",547,,138,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/cf8onm/8_months_later_5_editorial_playlists_140k_spotify/,"8 Months later 5 Editorial Playlists, 140K Spotify Streams and an upcoming Release on Proximity - All while working full time. 3 Simple Tips to those pursuing music on the side","8 months later 5 editorial playlists, 140k spotify streams and an upcoming release on proximity - all while working full time. 3 simple tips to those pursuing music on the side","  tl;dr do more.

c88j3p,1562069832.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,MinuteLeopard,I've been a blog editor for 12 years - some personal notes on how to approach music bloggers,"Hiya

Thought I'd share some personal thoughts and guidance (some editors may disagree) on the pitches I receive for the site I run.

I've been running a rock and indie site for about 12 years now, around a day job, and get hundreds of emails a day. It's gotten a lot worse over the past few months, with lots of stuff we'd never feature (wrong genres), which of course creates noise for the more relevant artists and events. Especially if you've been emailing me trying to get featured! ;)

Hope this helps someone...happy to answer questions!

&amp;#x200B;

**Don't buy an email list**

Not only is it dodgy AF (and illegal because of the GDPR), it's poor practice to scattergun-email by using these lists, without knowing the sites and what they feature - especially genrewise and locale-wise. The people making these lists aren't doing legal things by collecting other people's information without asking, and selling it is even worse.

Even if the person's email address and name is on their website for public consumption, it doesn't give you a right to store their data, never mind sell it. Familiarise yourself with the [GDPR](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/) law from last year - and YES, it does apply if you are outside of Europe. YES, it applies if you're an artist. NO, marketing isn't a ""legitimate interest"". I'm currently battling to get myself off several of these lists, where people are making money from my email address and didn't ask if I minded....ask the hundreds of bands who can't get their music seen for all the rap and soul emails I keep getting...!

&amp;#x200B;

**Don't add people to your mailing list without their permission** 

Again, because of the GDPR. Email them, introduce yourself, and ask if they'd like to opt-in. Relationship building is a fab thing to do anyway, tbh. I always remember people and will open the mailing list stuff from people who have previously engaged with me. If you haven't, I'll ask YOU to remove me, because why should I take the extra step instead of moving to the next email. Yes, you're a musician and nobody is going to come after you...that is not the point. It really isn't. We're supposed to be working together...and enough spam email reports won't do your mailing list any favours!

&amp;#x200B;

**Don't send Wetransfer files over to randos**

Yes, we get this loads. Wetransfer scattergunning is a thing. Fair enough, there's nothing attached, but it's additional noise.

&amp;#x200B;

**Don't attach files**

Images, MP3s...they will be deleted.

&amp;#x200B;

**Avoid socials...**

Don't pitch people on their personal social media, unless their site/profile explicitly invites it (some people have seperate music industry profiles)

My Facebook is for photos of my cats and my complaining about the weather. It's not for work - the day job, or the evening one.

&amp;#x200B;

**So what should I do?**

ASK! Ask how people prefer to be pitched as it varies. Some of my peers like tweets and DMs, some of them have FB page autoresponders, some use submission sites like SubmitHub (I tried it, found a lot of irrelevant genres and scattergun stuff on there so gave up), some prefer actual email and some still are probably tetchy because physical promos aren't a thing anymore.

Have a press release that has links to online content - a press page perhaps. Have your social media profiles all ready so there's no need for someone to back and forth email you for more information. Take the time to email someone personally. Read their website, check out their social media, find bands who are where you aspire to be or your peers and find out where they're being featured. Don't aim too high to start. Meet people at events, invite them to your shows, get to know them, build relationships with people, thank them and share their sites when they feature you.

Hey friends!

The Ambient Soundscapes playlist's 23rd rotation is ready. Summer is definitely here, and during the past week I have enjoyed listening to your suggestions and submissions in my garden.  
 I have had a hard time narrowing down this week’s selection to just 10 tracks. I have had to save quite a great deal of music for the coming rotations.

This weeks recommended artist: Ishq

Matt Hillier is the figure behind the UK based act Ishq. Matt is no new name on the stage, having released more than 50 albums over the past 20+ years. Ishq combines classical ambient music with a more experimental sound resulting in a very unique style. I have followed Matt’s music for a long time and I still return to his music often. This week I feature his track Vhale which is from the new album Light and Space.  
 I can recommend the whole album from start to end. 

For more Ishq go visit his website at www.ishq.org

Freshly added tracks in this 23rd rotation by following artists:

Siddhartha Barnhoorn, Ishq, Brique A Braq, Haav, Alpha Mound, Ken Verheecke, Distant Fires Burning, Realizer, Antarctic Wastelands, Canadian Rifles, Hirola
