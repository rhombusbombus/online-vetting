i9lrx0,1597411016,WeAreTheMusicMakers,BlancoDj,Music Promotion review #1: Fiverr gigs for Spotify promotion under 25$,"\*\*Message before reading, the goal of this post is not to promote my music at all but to see the results you can get with fiverr promotion for artists. All links have been disabled but I'll post the full article with the links to seller on my page\*\*

Hey what’s up producers!

I am writing this post today to talk about the different promotion tools available to us and since I recently got my second track out (The Trek) I decided that I would be offering my money to science and try out these different services available. I tried to take the most “legit” offers, what I mean is that I took a look at the general reviews of the previous customers and I also removed all the offers that promised a precise amount of views since it is generally bots.The prices are between 10$ and 25$ for all options.

**Background**

Before we dive into the subject: I am a 21 year old Canadian producer and I’ve been making music for less than 5 months (This is why my track is far from being the best but I still feel proud of it and I also welcome any constructive comments about it) I’m a big fan of progressive house/future bass (Martin Garrix is my MVP) and I am really into edm. I’m currently studying marketing in school, which is why this is very interesting to me. Note that I didn’t make any big announcements before getting my music out.

*I am saying all that just to explain that the results of this experience are only coming from paid marketing.*

Disclaimer: I am fully aware that the first rule to be able to make it in the music industry is to master your craft first and release good music, but I’m not patient and I prefer to use the lean startup. So I know that my music is not really a revolution but I still want to proceed with this experience :)

*The goal:* Bring awareness to my new track “The Trek”, get 50 new followers and 500 new plays on Spotify. I currently have 257 monthly listeners and about 600 streams from my first release.

*The plan:*

Release my track on all platforms using Distrokid but concentrate my resources on Spotify for this experience. I choose this platform based on my personal preferences.I tried to run the campaigns in a way that they don’t overlap to see the effectiveness of each ads but, since they are promising “organic traffic” it is possible that the views come later for certain offers. I am also starting with only fiverr gigs but, for my future tracks I am planning on using other different options such as omari,daimoon, zire, etc. If you have any suggestions drop them in the comments and I’ll review them with pleasure! I am also thinking about creating videos about these reviews so let me know if it would be easier to watch to see if it is worth it, there is also a pictured format of this review on my Instagram page. If there are any interesting metrics missing for you don’t hesitate to tell me, I will add them in my next reviews.

*\*Note that all amounts are in Canadian dollars and the tip is not included\**

**The offers I selected:**

**Option 1:** Use the offer of fine\_articles to put my song in front of 150k active listeners for a total of three days.

Price: ***17.00$***

***Results:***

*Ordered on:* 31/07/2020

***Date of service:*** **31/07/2020 to 02/08/2020**

***Amount of new plays:*** **7,500**

***Amount of new followers:*** **123**

*Comments:* The delivery was quick and effective, I got a lot of new streams and monthly listeners. Everything was coming from my “other listener’s playlists” so I assume that it was indeed organic promotion or at least it was looking a lot like it. I was able to see from which playlists the views were coming from and I got listeners from all over the U.S. in many different cities. I recommend this seller, he delivered what he was offering and went higher than my expectations. I felt like the streams were very legit but feel free to let me know your opinion!

**Option 2:** Use the offer of ""Anniegraphics"" to get my song in front of 50k active listeners for a total of three days. Price: ***16.88$***

***Results:***

*Ordered on:* *03/08/2020*

***Date of service:*** **03/08/2020 to 06/08/2020**

***Amount of new plays:*** **6,800 (total 14.2k)**

***Amount of new followers:*** **Gain 139 but they all disappeared two days after.**

*Comments:* The seller was responsive and started the delivery on the same day I ordered it. The results were still very acceptable for a 17$ gig, the fact that I lost all my new followers two days after the end of the gigs is really bugging me out and making me think they were bots.

**Option 3:** Use the offer of ""Articlemaniac01"" to put my song in front of 350k active listeners for a total of five days.

Price: ***23.65$***

***Results:***

*Ordered on: 06/08/2020*

*Date of service:* 06/08/2020 to 11/08/2020

*Amount of new plays:* 2,200

*Amount of new followers:* 236

Comments: I am writing this on the 8 of august and the seller marked the delivery as “in progress” but I am currently receiving no stream at all and it has been more than two days, I am becoming septic. **Update:** on the 11th the order is updated and it is marked as completed, I have received the following results based of placement on 2 playlists. The problem is that one of the playlist has around 3.5k of likes and the other one has 4. The problem? Each one bring me about 1.1k of streams. Seeing the results is making me doubt a lot about the quality of the streams I got. I am not recommending this seller at all after this new information. I posted a review expressing my doubts about this gig and the seller contacted me saying that he changed the strategy of the promotion to email marketing but was not able to provide any proof of that.

&amp;#x200B;

||Cost|Number of days|Streams|Followers|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Offer 1|17.00$|3 days|7,500|123|
|Offer 2|16.88$|3 days|6,800|139\*|
|Offer 3|23.65$|5 days\*\*|2,200|236|
|***Total***|***57.53$***|***13 days***|***16,500***|***359***|

\*All disappeared after the promotion

\*\* Really started at the end of the second day so more like 3 full days of promotion...

**To conclude**, I think that the services of music promotion for artists are very sketch, you are never able to be sure that the streams you got were real and seller offer very few to no evidence at all of the campaigns they run. If you had to choose, I would only recommend the first seller who is Fine\_articles, because to me, this is the only seller that really made me think it was real and I was able to see from where the streams were coming and look legit. So it is not a surprise that I was able to reach my goals for this campaign.

Like mentioned above, I am working on new tracks that will be a lot more professional than this one with vocalists and real sound engineer so don't hesitate to comment which music promotion for independent artists you would like to see here and I'll try to add them to my list!

c2s92c,1561010175,chinaglass,Abu_Faissel,Got this piece in 5 days and it works amazing!,"A big thumbs up for the seller @daimoon and for this piece it came in 5 days!!! To Israel which is very fucking fast and in great condition and a great packaging. I orderd it on the 13/06  and got it in 18/06!  What I have to say is the seller was very fast and responsive to my questions. Unfortunately I can't smoke out of this piece at the moment due to legal issiues but of course I tried it without smoking and the function is amazing,it feels thick (6-7mm thick) and good pretty durable but surely I wouldn't test it. it is HUGE - 20"" or 52 cm, great size for me because I like 'em biggg haha. One only downside is the matrix perk at the top doesn't sit evenly in the middle but it's just a minor flaw and a cosmetic one because the function is amazing on it.
70 bucks for this piece is a great price and a bang for the buck as you say. I also got it with a ashcatcher with a removable downstem because it does not need any Percolation or drag more than it does already, trust me get a dry ash catcher - got it for 13 bucks and it's well worth because it keeps this beauty clean! 
Just saying this is not the bowl that came with it, it came with a regular china bowl that is just mehh not good.. The bowl you see in the photo is from dhgate for 9 dollar for 3 bowls and it's great, thick glass and great functioning bowl I will link it at the end of the post. 
I will give a thorough review on it in a few weeks for anyone intersted and gather opinions from friends about it, for now as you can see they loved it!

One only downside is the matrix perk at the top doesn't sit evenly in the middle but it's just a minor flaw and a cosmetic one because the function is amazing on it. 70 bucks for this piece is a great price and a bang for the buck as you say. I also got it with a ashcatcher with a removable downstem because it does not need any Percolation or drag more than it does already, trust me get a dry ash catcher - got it for 13 bucks and it's well worth because it keeps this beauty clean!  Just saying this is not the bowl that came with it, it came with a regular china bowl that is just mehh not good.. The bowl you see in the photo is from dhgate for 9 dollar for 3 bowls and it's great, thick glass and great functioning bowl I will link it at the end of the post.  I will give a thorough review on it in a few weeks for anyone intersted and gather opinions from friends about it, for now as you can see they loved it! Pictures of piece   Link for piece  Link for ash catcher  Link for bowl/slide ","a big thumbs up for the seller  and for this piece it came in 5 days!!! to israel which is very fucking fast and in great condition and a great packaging. i orderd it on the 13/06  and got it in 18/06!  what i have to say is the seller was very fast and responsive to my questions. unfortunately i can't smoke out of this piece at the moment due to legal issiues but of course i tried it without smoking and the function is amazing,it feels thick (6-7mm thick) and good pretty durable but surely i wouldn't test it. it is huge - 20"" or 52 cm, great size for me because i like 'em biggg haha. one only downside is the matrix perk at the top doesn't sit evenly in the middle but it's just a minor flaw and a cosmetic one because the function is amazing on it. 70 bucks for this piece is a great price and a bang for the buck as you say. i also got it with a ashcatcher with a removable downstem because it does not need any percolation or drag more than it does already, trust me get a dry ash catcher - got it for 13 bucks and it's well worth because it keeps this beauty clean!  just saying this is not the bowl that came with it, it came with a regular china bowl that is just mehh not good.. the bowl you see in the photo is from dhgate for 9 dollar for 3 bowls and it's great, thick glass and great functioning bowl i will link it at the end of the post.  i will give a thorough review on it in a few weeks for anyone intersted and gather opinions from friends about it, for now as you can see they loved it! pictures of piece   link for piece  link for ash catcher  link for bowl/slide ",10,320

I haven't done anything yet. I dont want to waive the protection DHgate offers, but I also dont want to ruin my chance at getting a new piece.
