After being absolutely bombarded with their ads, I decided to try them out. Some background: I’ve been making music all my life, have had charting songs, songs placed in film and TV, and other successes. I say this not to toot my own horn, but to give you an idea of the quality of work I’m putting out. 

In Nov, I bought the “pro” package from them - it promised 5k - 25k streams (estimated) and 15+ placements. While they *did* place my songs on 16 lists, they were very low in the pecking order (150 or so) and buried with hundreds of other songs. After a couple weeks, I had only had around 50 plays - far below the projected number. 

I reached out and emailed a rep who apologized and promised to adjust things - placing my song higher up, getting more eyeballs on it, etc. He told me to give it a week. Nothing happened - in fact, it just dropped off even more. 

I reached out again and got no response. They did, however, inundate me with emails trying to get more of my money to “boost” my campaign. 

I can’t say this is how it always goes, but my experience has been that they over promise and under deliver. In my opinion, they are not worth a hot red cent. Perhaps if they spent less time spamming ads on socials and putting it into their product, they’d actually be able to deliver on their promises.
