,,MusicPromotion,"Hey Guys!

Hope you doin well. I'm independent musician for more than 7 years. You already know how it's such a trouble to promote your own music as independent musicians. I had this problem as well but this issue really start to get so much annoying for me. In deep Im about to give it up.

Let me write you which Spotify promotion &amp; marketing methods I've tried so far.

1- Google ads - Obviously useless for musician

2- Ig Ads - Better than google but not effective again

3- Playlist Promotion website: Like soundcampaign, playlist push I almost spend more than 1.000 dolar on that website. Yeahh they put your song some organic playlist but maybe we gain about 10k stream totally. 1.000 dolar for 1.000 stream this is insane as I said. These are nice websites but for price and gain really I don't think people can work with these website more than 1

4- Tiktok influencer: Full of bot. For my last release I worked with 10 micro-influencer total 10m people watch these video but thats all! Even not small move to stream

5- Purchase Bot Streams: All musicians &amp; independent record labels around me talk about [Spotifypanel.com](https://Spotifypanel.com) for last 1 years which they always use their bot stream services to boost their spotify streams. As I know or heard lots of biggest world start using their services as well. We all know that these was not the solution in the long term or can hurt our profile. I make some try about 10 dolar. believe me or not but these plays has better outcome for me when I compare to other costly way. But This is just 10 dolar order Im'm not sure that you can build all your career on bot plays.

Shortly I need your advise guys :) Really gladly appreciate all your advice.

,,MusicPromotion,"Hey there,

I'm a music curator on Spotify, I own a large network of playlists and I've been working as curator on platforms such as Submithub, Playlister Club, Groover... 

Well, I used to work on Soundcampaign for a while and I noticed many things:

\- They don't have any filter for the artists / music, most of the music I received sounded like a produced just opened a DAW for the 1st time, which means they're not going to be picked by us and the platform is literally taking their money.

\- As curators, the 1st point I explained means that we're the 'bad' guys from the artist perspective, so we can get negative reviews from the artists.

\- Then comes Soundcampaign and say your 'reviews' aren't being good enough (which are very extended and well developed, never had any complaint on Submithub for example) and they use that excuse to avoid paying us for our work.

So, the point is: Soundcampaing is a complete SCAM, for both artists and curators.

they will simply take your money and nothing else will happen !  


The point is that you pay in advance for an opportunity to add or put your song in a playlist, the concept is not really logical  


You might end up paying a lot but if your song didn't get listed then you lost all of your money  


I even don't know or not able to verify anyone else used the service and got the benefits out of it

,,soundcampaign,"Be careful. Through Soundcampaign I got on 4 playlists out of 7. They had 4.1k followers in total the one with most followers was 1500. The number of streams I got from each in the first week was less than 3 I could see this from my Spotify for artist page under playlists for my song. When I looked at the playlists my song had been added to, the number of songs and type of songs in the playlist suggested these were unlikely to be playlists with real followers. When i brought the issue up to their customer service I was dismissed and they told me this was normal and they did not take responsibility for the number of plays. Anyone who's done their research knows that a song in 3rd position on a playlist of 1500 followers would get more than 3 plays in a week. Soundcampaign should be vetting their playlists. Wheb using other similar services where I submitted my song and got selected and put on a 1500 playlist I got about 200-300 plays in that same timeframe.  


The fact that they were unwilling to look into the issue even when i sent them clear documentation on the matter makes me think they are just interested in collecting money and not running a good service.

,,soundcampaign,"The worst service I've ever bought on the web (and I'm a web designer from 20 years).  


The starting idea is good, but in the end it is a mockery.  


I signed up as an artist, I started the campaign choosing as musical genres where I wanted to show my song ""Folk Punk"" and ""Celtic Rock"".  


The playlists owner answered me that my song didn't fit in their playlist, and for a while I was able to watch at their playlist from a link in the backend (they removed this link after my first complain) and in a playlist (for example) tagged as CELTIC ROCK there were bands like COLDPLAY, BRUNO MARS, ONE DIRECTION, BEYONCE, MAROON5. Are they Celtic Rock artists? You can judge by yourself. So maybe the curator snag them? Yes, but I'm losing my money, in the worst useless way buying their product.  


Then I've try again with another song choosing MODERN FOLK ROCK. Same results. Quoting a curator:""I still appreciate this track. It has punchy lyrics and has nice melody. The instruments used complements with the vocal tones, melody and the lyrics. It really sounds folksy but sadly the vibe doesn’t fit enough my soft indie folk playlist."" I've choosen MODERN FOLK ROCK and this guy is telling me his playlist is SOFT INDIE.  


And the answer of the SoundCampaign guys is ""well the curators can add up to 10 tags to their playlist"". Ok, you can wash your hands like Pontius Pilate. But it creates really bad experiences.

What a joke. Nothing but a fraud. Paid them to get our new single up. Curators use standard comments about the song. It is placed in playlists that has NOTHING to do with our genre. Embarrasing!

,,soundcampaign," **They take your money and offer nothing in return**

This is too close to a scam to be called anything else. I paid £50 and was submitted to 4 playlists out of 5. All 4 were rejected, meaning they don't target your submissions at all. They say they offer a refund, but really it's just credit that you can't use unless you pay more money for another campaign.

,,soundcampaign,"Here is some background as to why this whole subreddit exists.

Long ago, I created a Spotify playlist of songs to accompany the Fallout universe of games. They were all from 1949-1961 and my list clearly indicated that. Predictably my email address was scraped from the playlist and sold as marketing lists to record labels and artists (who wanted their songs on lists) and once the torrent of emails came in I removed all of my contact information from every list.

I was diligent in unsubscribing or blocking the wave of emails from this brief time (nearly 2 years ago) and the torrent of emails turned into a trickle.

Thursday, March 27th 2021 I received the 2nd email in a row from a representative from SoundCampaign. He sent me the usual followup email that any beginner salesman has used.

&gt;Hi there,  
&gt;  
&gt;I haven’t received a reply about the mail I sent to you a few days ago.I assume that you might be very busy and may have forgotten to check it, so I thought to follow-up.  
&gt;  
&gt;Have you taken a look at it yet? I look forward to your reply.  
&gt;  
&gt;Kind regards,REDACTEDArtists Management at SoundCampaign

I replied back that I would like to unsubscribe, and that they needed to have an unsubscribe option on their emails in the future if they wanted to appear to be a legitimate business. I received another email from this person the following day, and requested to be unsubscribed again.

I received this response:

&gt;As stated before, the internet does not work in that way. As a lawyer, I fully know what I am talking about. No need for any explanations from your side.  
&gt;  
&gt;You are not on any mailing list, by the way. However, you won 't receive any other communications.  
&gt;  
&gt;Best,  
&gt;  
&gt;REDACTEDArtists Department Manager at SoundCampaign

Odd. I hadn't had my email in my Spotify for 2 years and, yet, this person had apparently magically guessed my email. The fact that my playlist was clearly not modern music was apparently irrelevant - he just HAD to get in touch with me. I wasn't buying it.

Irritated, I decided to look at their website and found that they very proudly listed a TrustPilot page with a 4.4/5 rating. Impressive! What was even more impressive was their Instagram, which had only ever posted 4 times and had 19K followers.

&amp;#x200B;

I checked to make sure I was eligible to submit a review on TrustPilot (I was) and then posted my negative interaction with this guy.

Within a few hours I received an email from SoundCampaign again. A new guy this time! A Customer Support Specialist.

&gt;I hope you are doing well. This is REDACTED, a Customer Support Specialist at SoundCampaign.   
&gt;  
&gt;I am sending you this email because a few days ago you wrote a 1-star review about SoundCampaign on TrustPilot and you were asked to provide your information. However, we could not find the email address you provided on our database.   
&gt;  
&gt;I would like to kindly ask you to provide me with the email address you used to register on SoundCampaign so that we can stop sending you emails that you do not want to receive and also to see about the possibility that you can delete the review in order to avoid misunderstandings with our artists.  
&gt;  
&gt;I also apologize for any misunderstandings that may have occurred with mailings in the past and hope that we can talk to resolve this.   
&gt;  
&gt;I look forward to hearing from you.

One thing I can say positive about SoundCampaign is that their tone is almost always exceedingly polite! I emailed this new guy back and let him know that I do not have an email address with them because of his coworker repeatedly emailing me in spite of being asked to stop. I also requested to no longer receive email from SoundCampaign. This is my third time to request it.

He replied back fairly quickly.

&gt;Thank you so much for your response.  
&gt;  
&gt;We understand the situation and apologize for any inconveniences again.However, as you have stated, you are not a customer of ours, therefore it is not appropriate to provide a review based on an inexistent customer experience. Trustpilot is meant for customers that have acquired a service.Moreover, you are currently not -and you have never been- on a mailing list. Your email was public on Spotify and this is how my colleagues could contact you. We will never contact you again as we understand that you do not want to receive emails from us.

&gt;We kindly ask you to voluntarily remove your review in order to avoid misunderstandings with our artists. 

Hmm. This new guy #2 seems to know what he's talking about! I'd better check the trustpilot page, maybe I'm remembering the rules wrong.

https://preview.redd.it/g56i8xy64n571.png?width=767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4616f275383e5ed9f3ff3612fb87fc8e82980cf0

Well no, clearly that's wrong. Guy #2 must be mistaken. I let him know about the Trustpilot Guidelines and asked him again to please stop messaging me.

I heard nothing from SoundCampaign for a couple of days. It was quiet. Then I received a notice from TrustPilot - my review had been flagged. I needed to provide all of my interactions with Guy #1 and Guy #2, which I happily provided, along with another review covering my interactions with Guy #2.

Basically as soon as my second review hit, an old friend re-appeared. Guy #1 sent me a new email, but... it wasn't with all the other emails. It sure looked like his email address, though! Upon closer inspection, guy #1 has a domain for his list spamming ([soundcmps.com](https://soundcmps.com)) and one for his actual work email ([soundcampaign.com](https://soundcampaign.com)) so as to not get their intra-office communications blacklisted at the major spam houses. Smart!

&gt;From the very beginning we have been completely respectful and have had no issue with you not wanting to be part of our curators network.  
&gt;  
&gt;My colleague REDACTED #2 just kindly invited you to remove your review as, once again, you are not a real customer.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, don't worry. We will kindly proceed and escalate the case to get the needed rectifications done.   
&gt;  
&gt;Have an amazing day!  
&gt;  
&gt;Best,  
&gt;

Both of my reviews were flagged at this point, and I provided all of the contact information once again to TrustPilot.

I put in a support request to TrustPilot to let them know that SoundCampaign was continuing to email me and was flagging legitimate reviews as fraudulent.

I spoke to Spotify regarding SoundCampaign emailing me in regards to my Spotify playlist and received this response.

&gt;Thank you for sharing these details, we sincerely appreciate this.  
&gt;  
&gt;We filed an internal report on this website and on their activities to let the right people in Spotify investigate this further and take all the necessary actions against them. At the same time, let us recommend to report this scam to the proper authorities.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks again for your cooperation. Let us know if you have any other questions.

Sadly, my local authorities couldn't do much about spam email coming from - where was this company?

A quick search of SoundCampaign's website listed an address in Israel. I ran the address through Google and it was, in fact, just a WeWork. Thankfully, Guy #1 had provided his full name and a quick search revealed that he was from Barranquilla, a town in Colombia.

I shared my frustration with SoundCampaign on my personal networks on LinkedIn and Facebook. I searched Reddit and discovered that my good 'friend' Guy #1 was active on Reddit and was quick to strike down any notions that SoundCampaign was anything less than legitimate. I let another commenter know that SoundCampaign was spamming playlist owners with offers, and Guy #1 **doxxed me on Reddit.**

That's fine. Two can play at that game. I made another post, and another, until every mention of SoundCampaign I could find featured my wonderful experience with SoundCampaign.

This made Guy #1 very angry.

The emails started slow at first. A newsletter called 'NextDraft', one called 'LifeEdited' and the BBC all suddenly had requests from my email address to be signed up. Wish, Healthline, GetSiteControl, another newsletter called 'Brain Pickings' all suddenly had signups from what appeared to be me. I suspected the wonderful staff at SoundCampaign, but couldn't prove anything definitively.

Not until Guy #1 messed up and started to submit forms on his competitor's sites to waste both my time and theirs.

I received an email from a nice person at iBoostU, who responded with the contents of a submitted form, including the IP address from which the form was submitted. A quick search:

&amp;#x200B;

[Direct identifying information blurred out.](https://preview.redd.it/kykky8zs8n571.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea2d2dd6eb7ea0deaa47999a75f7b1c66c4b416f)

Barranquilla. That sounded familiar. Of course, this is where Guy #1 is from.

I copied Guy #1 on the email I received from the iBoostU guy and included the CEO of SoundCampaign on the email.

The CEO told me he would do an investigation of what Guy #1 was doing, but in the meantime he would like me to remove my negative reviews. Clever. I told him that I'd take them down when his 'investigation' was complete. I never heard from him again. I was signed up for a new newsletter the next day. And the next day.

My TrustPilot reviews are regularly flagged by SoundCampaign and I have to provide them all the information every time they flag it or the review will be pulled down after 3 days. I realized that this is why SoundCampaign's reviews seem to be so overwhelmingly positive - they harass those who post negative reviews until they are removed.

So that is why this sub exists - to document the continued harassment by SoundCampaign and to share the negative reviews that are either flagged and deleted or bullied off the internet by the staff of SoundCampaign.",t2_cmn5uafe,,,,,0.0,,,"The SoundCampaign Saga, Spamming and Doxxing and Fraud, oh my!",[],,,False,,,,,37.0,,False,t3_o17cla,,False,,dark,1.0,,,restricted,,self.soundcampaign,,,140.0,,False,,,False,,False,,{},,,,1,,False,False,,https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/djzIkHoGTGz3s0v4wQvy7nNpMNm7n_1I26S6IBHfJDc.jpg,1623857028.0,,[],,{},,,,True,,,,text,,,,,,,,,text,0.0,False,,,,,,,,False,,True,True,False,False,,[],,False,/r/soundcampaign/comments/o17cla/the_soundcampaign_saga_spamming_and_doxxing_and/,{},True,,False,False,,,[],,,,,,t5_4m0uu8,,,,,,,o17cla,True,,Alan_Greenspin,,0,False,,,,False,,False,,,,True,https://www.reddit.com/r/soundcampaign/comments/o17cla/the_soundcampaign_saga_spamming_and_doxxing_and/,,1.0,1623856827.0,0.0,,,False,,,"{'g56i8xy64n571': {'e': 'Image', 'id': 'g56i8xy64n571', 'm': 'image/png', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/g56i8xy64n571.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44e491be25d30e04766fa9b5659513df200324b6', 'x': 108, 'y': 103}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/g56i8xy64n571.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f0faecb833560a4c949360eeb324dab7e8723ba', 'x': 216, 'y': 206}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/g56i8xy64n571.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a44d6c4dcc2403df5ec7afcabf24f787df44f0d', 'x': 320, 'y': 305}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/g56i8xy64n571.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a25449e6fa6d80f80f42d860566e0cdbfba75f19', 'x': 640, 'y': 611}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/g56i8xy64n571.png?width=767&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4616f275383e5ed9f3ff3612fb87fc8e82980cf0', 'x': 767, 'y': 733}, 'status': 'valid'}, 'kykky8zs8n571': {'e': 'Image', 'id': 'kykky8zs8n571', 'm': 'image/png', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/kykky8zs8n571.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=373ca77f1e8232186bc604de66a8298f91b910eb', 'x': 108, 'y': 75}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/kykky8zs8n571.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85a764ce9a8dbbd187832e184ecabbb2d0143671', 'x': 216, 'y': 151}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/kykky8zs8n571.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54b63c29cfe4fa3beaecd6c370a35fe90fd471fc', 'x': 320, 'y': 223}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/kykky8zs8n571.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e27abae126f8e6e70faa34f1afddf5483a7b90cd', 'x': 640, 'y': 447}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/kykky8zs8n571.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea2d2dd6eb7ea0deaa47999a75f7b1c66c4b416f', 'x': 768, 'y': 537}, 'status': 'valid'}, 'oq64fja67n571': {'e': 'Image', 'id': 'oq64fja67n571', 'm': 'image/png', 'p': [{'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/oq64fja67n571.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=432ceb4d23718a040ea82dbc868f43b2197c2569', 'x': 108, 'y': 29}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/oq64fja67n571.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b369725272f1f84176b165e25dcdd72e9d094d40', 'x': 216, 'y': 58}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/oq64fja67n571.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9af908ead94350a8f391531baa56027981b68e61', 'x': 320, 'y': 86}, {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/oq64fja67n571.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ccaed6b36c77574864c88e841fd2e906556058b3', 'x': 640, 'y': 173}], 's': {'u': 'https://preview.redd.it/oq64fja67n571.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0b84568195bf35983ac27f841bbc92c7c46d8b48', 'x': 886, 'y': 240}, 'status': 'valid'}}",1623274784.0,,1624509202.0,,,,,soundcampaign,,,,,,,

Find another option. That's a well maked-up website.  


If you really want to dig-in, find some sites that you can check curators, their lists, genre diversity etc. There're lots of them.  


In s.c. ; you dont even know who just listened your song &amp; album :)  


Summary for the S.C. ''campaign'' :  


Paid 90 USD for potencially 14k listeners (according to s.c). Result: Not even 30! Added 3 playlists also (all p.lists have min 600 followers). So, i don't think these playlists alive enough :)  


I can easily say that, it's not a living area. They need to change their business set but i don't think they 'll. Anyway s.c. is continuing to earn money :)  


So, find another one.  


NEW INFO :  
I read their answer (down below). Another quick summary for you:  


There 're 2 variables for the campaign's price:  


1. Curator numbers  
2. ''Potencially'' playlist follower numbers  


Also there were 2 option for my budget:  


1. 56 USD for 6 curators and nearly 5000 playlist followers  
2. 90 USD for 6 curators and nearly 14000 playlist followers.  


So they 're using ''POTENCIALLY'' PLAYLIST FOLLOWER NUMBERS for campaign price. But after a unsuccesfull result, repeating this: ''We're not selling streams. ''  


Yes, we know that and it's not the point.  


If the follower numbers and the campaign result have not any connection, STOP SELLING IT, it's misleading.

,,soundcampaign,"SoundCampaign had my original review removed, but people should know my experience from this company. I removed my song off Spotify because it was being botted by a playlist that I was put on by Souncampaign.

  
The amount you have to pay to be considered for a playlist is extortionate and that does not guarantee you a spot. A lot of the reviews I received seemed to not be from genuine curators as they were all worded badly and had many spelling errors. Sometimes the reviews would not even relate to my song.  


It takes spamming their customer service chats just to talk to a real person and they have no means of removing you from these playlists they can only email. This curator was already known to them for doing this, so clearly their system to avoid curators with bad intentions is not thorough.

,,edmproduction,"This post concerns anyone daft enough to pitch your EDM song to playlist curators using pitching services. 

For anyone commenting blah blah we told you so; I know so. I am stupid. Please don't make my mistakes. Forewarned is warned etc or whatever the phrase is.

I think playlist [placement is a waste of time](https://najinsan.wordpress.com/2021/02/15/i-paid-for-spotify-playlist-placements-so-you-dont-have-to/), but that's another story.

There are various services that connect the producer with the curator and for a fee you can pitch their track to them. Prices vary massively so Submit hub it's anything from $0 to $3 and Soundcampaign it's anything up to $15 per pitch.

It's the latter service I'm warning folks about. I recently pitched to 12 curators, got accepted to 7 playlists with a cumulative reach of about 16k. Fast forward 2 weeks and my total streams is 290. I paid $160 for the privilege. That works out about 55 cents per stream. FML

But it somehow gets worse!
Of those 7 playlists the song was added, it has been removed from 4 at some point in the last 2 weeks. Of the remaining 3, 2 have yet to yield any streams and the remaining has produced....3 streams. 

But wait! There's more!
One of the playlists that accepted me had the curious distinction of not only removing the track after a few days but also yielded approximately 0 streams anyway. Its so funny I could cry!

I'd treat the integrity of playlists in platforms like Soundcampaign as extreme high risk and I think folks need to know that.

I'm not commenting about Submithub bc Jason will probably pitch in here. I like it there but for different reasons.

Finally, to reiterate, this is just a reflection of my desperation to get a few plays. And the fault is mine for not using better routes to build a fan base.

,,edmproduction,"I've written a long blog post here about it all [here](https://najinsan.wordpress.com/2021/02/15/i-paid-for-spotify-playlist-placements-so-you-dont-have-to/) but I'm summarising here so you don't have to go anywhere. 

Some of you will already know this and be all like ""we told you so, you idiot"" in which case I am just reinforcing key findings. The findings also apply to my experience. Caveat emptor.

**Here's what I found out**
* Paying for pitching services such as Submithib, Groover and Soundcampaign works and you can increase your monthly streams on Spotify. I increased mine from 0 to about 2k
* The increase in streams does not translate at all well to followers. I gained maybe 20 followers.
* The success rates of different platforms varies wildly. Submithub approval rate was much less than Soundcampaigns.
* There are factors that dictate how many streams a playlist will refer. These are: track position on playlist, time on playlist, number of likes the playlist has. Before you submit to a playlist check how often it is updated. You want ones with *less updates*
* It is not worth submitting to Instagram influencers - the posts are too transient and short lived in my experience
* Submithub's Hot or Not function is incredibly useful in giving you objective feedback, if not a little honest at times. It was also useful at interacting with record labels.",t2_deffu,,,,,0.0,,,I paid for Spotify promotion so you don't have to,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",,,False,6.0,,,,,,False,t3_lkh5nm,,False,,dark,0.58,,,public,,self.edmproduction,,,,,False,,,False,,False,,{},Discussion,,,3,,False,False,,self,False,,[],,{},self,,,True,,,,richtext,6.0,,,,,,,,text,0.0,False,,,,,,,,False,,False,True,False,False,"{'enabled': False, 'images': [{'id': 'Jx6UHPax5zqRATWvrwbFq8oubsfOgzaPmXprgYC5EK8', 'resolutions': [{'height': 16, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/CWkqjKpBMsBSQG88ffN01LkUOnhh4qFCXoGatjxx68Q.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3302d621beb8850f555f1fd490ef66ae84358c86', 'width': 108}, {'height': 33, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/CWkqjKpBMsBSQG88ffN01LkUOnhh4qFCXoGatjxx68Q.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1081e245bfa0d3b7c97ed1c497943451bcb60524', 'width': 216}, {'height': 50, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/CWkqjKpBMsBSQG88ffN01LkUOnhh4qFCXoGatjxx68Q.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e78080fb77d4da2ed10e05f9fe0dacf8dc732a8', 'width': 320}, {'height': 100, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/CWkqjKpBMsBSQG88ffN01LkUOnhh4qFCXoGatjxx68Q.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03bbc416ce0e7e9ee9efcd5406f2306bb7bc151d', 'width': 640}, {'height': 151, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/CWkqjKpBMsBSQG88ffN01LkUOnhh4qFCXoGatjxx68Q.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b092f63a9100d8b48cdc3881a1dbd6274d25122e', 'width': 960}, {'height': 169, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/CWkqjKpBMsBSQG88ffN01LkUOnhh4qFCXoGatjxx68Q.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14c64f389a9fd6b73c67c7015f30244c4ab4cd0c', 'width': 1080}], 'source': {'height': 302, 'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/CWkqjKpBMsBSQG88ffN01LkUOnhh4qFCXoGatjxx68Q.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=36601287b22f3c212fe861c6091752a4f2b06033', 'width': 1920}, 'variants': {}}]}",[],,False,/r/edmproduction/comments/lkh5nm/i_paid_for_spotify_promotion_so_you_dont_have_to/,{},True,,False,False,,,[],,,,,,t5_2sa4x,,,,,#46d160,,lkh5nm,True,,alfiealfiealfie,,5,True,,,,False,,False,,,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/lkh5nm/i_paid_for_spotify_promotion_so_you_dont_have_to/,all_ads,429308.0,1613406673.0,0.0,,,False,,1119d43c-2157-11eb-abf2-0ede2368d497,,1381016378.0,,1623387723.0,,,,,soundcampaign,,,,,,,

Camp Yeah Man! is a theme camp of 20-30 people, placed at 6:15 &amp; F.

Our interactivity includes a ratchet watering hole, where folks come to wet theirs beaks on our signature sloppy margaritas, while dancing to hip-hop at one of our throwback parties or cumbia nights. We also are known for having one of THE BEST sound systems on the playa outside of the soundcamps--plus a stripper pole if you really wanna get down to the rhythms of cumbia, reggaeton, salsa, etc.

Come get a YEAH MAN stamp on your bum during out “Booty Slap Happy Hour”. We are LGBTQ friendly and offer diversity in all senses of the word -- including diversity within our interactivity and camp members. We have an 8′ x 16′ stage, where in the past, we’ve hosted workshops and performances of many kinds. At this time, we are still curating our stage lineup. Perhaps you have an interactivity you’d like to host?

For information about our camp amenities and how we operate, you can read our official Membership Questionnaire at this link —&gt; https://forms.gle/gVyjKzjLQSMnP6ja6. Feel free to fill it out and/or contact us at campyeahman@gmail.com. Thanks!

,,truespotify,"Hi,

I had several playlists I created using my own music taste and some of them got popular.

My popular playlists under spam by ""report abuse"" bots, which are triggered by jealous playlist curators probably, for around 2 years.

Yesterday I got attacked again. I fixed the playlist data, and this morning I was shocked when I couldn't log in to my account. After a while I received an email that says:

&gt;""Notice under Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use  
&gt;  
&gt;The Terms expressly prohibit users from selling a user account or playlist, or otherwise accepting or offering to accept any compensation, financial or otherwise, to influence the content included on an account or playlist or the name of an account or playlist. It has come to Spotify’s attention that your account has engaged in unauthorized use in violation of the Terms. Spotify has therefore suspended your access to the Service and initiated a thorough review of the unauthorized activities.""

First, how do you know that I sell my playlists? How can you detect it?

Secondly, there are websites that make this explicitly already. Why don't Spotify stop them then? e.g soundcampaign, soundcamps.

I contacted customer services via live chat several times. They redirect me to someone from ""Escalations team"". The guy from the team immediately ended the chat several times. Then I talked to someone else, and he said I will receive an email about it. I contacted again using the given conversation id, but at that time escalations, the team staff said they don't have any information to share and they can't help. They also did say this is not something customer service can help with. So who can help me? I contacted u/SpotifyCares on Twitter many times, and they are basically ignoring me.  


I just want my account back. Is there anything else I can do? My account can be accessed by anyone still. In the worst case, I would want to remove the account completely!  


I found some articles about the same problem, but I didn't know my account will be disabled completely.

The song is a bit repetitive but especially the drop at 0:26 is pretty intense. I admire the subtle ambient synth in background as well as those irregularly occurring squeeky noises - Can you send me a link to this plugin? Anyway, as much as I would love to put this tune on my playlist, the main motive is a bit toady and the lack of drums and bass confuses me - it just doesn't sound natural.""*

,,ValorantCompetitive,"I've been a huge critic of DM for the past two years now, so you can imagine how elated I was to wake up to news that DM was getting changes today. Well, I just spent an hour in DM and I can't believe I'm saying this, but this iteration of Deathmatch feels so much worse than the last one. I love the new 1.5 second death cooldown, it makes the pace of DM so much more intense, but these spawns are horrendous. Because of this new spawning algorithm, people who soundcamp have even more of an advantage. In this entire hour, I've only died to people either spawning right on me two seconds after I do and catching me while I'm in a fight or from behind as I walk away from the spawn to look for a fight, or people who spawn around me while I'm looking for a fight and immediately wide-swing me. It's made it so that I either have to stay in the same area looking at the same three spots if I actually want to do anything besides chain-die for the entire match or turn off my music and turn up my audio to 100 if I want to simulate checking angles. Most CS community servers that I play also have garbage spawns and are filled with people who play like 2:1 K/D ratio = instant ~~Radiant~~ Level 10 Faceit, but it doesn't feel as bad as it does in this game because of instant respawns. I like that DM is still being looked at and I can appreciate the willingness to actually try to make it better, but the reality is that there is so much more work that needs to be put into this mode before it even feels decent to play, let along being actually good for practicing gunplay and warming up.",t2_4djit80k,,,,,0.0,,,Was this iteration of Deathmatch playtested before it was released or...?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",r/ValorantCompetitive,,False,6.0,discussion,,,,,False,t3_st9dg1,,False,,light,0.79,transparent,,public,,self.ValorantCompetitive,,,,68cda0f0-c40d-11ec-84ef-36f9740f02e0,False,,,False,,False,,{},Discussion,False,,112,,False,False,,self,1644985267.0,,"[{'a': ':100T:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/txm36btskam81_t5_2g5ach/100T'}, {'a': ':Skye:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/gmq2px5rdp181_t5_2g5ach/Skye'}, {'a': ':Jett:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/3mgeb6hwdp181_t5_2g5ach/Jett'}, {'a': ':Omen:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/uumtm9vudp181_t5_2g5ach/Omen'}, {'a': ':Sova:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/5achxsiqdp181_t5_2g5ach/Sova'}, {'a': ':Cypher:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/lgvlheoydp181_t5_2g5ach/Cypher'}, {'a': ':V1:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/anz59zc7v9281_t5_2g5ach/V1'}, {'a': ':Raze:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/qzifi47tdp181_t5_2g5ach/Raze'}, {'a': ':FaZe:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/5mp80tuip9281_t5_2g5ach/FaZe'}, {'a': ':Chamber:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/5wlnpnjodp181_t5_2g5ach/Chamber'}]",,{},,,,True,,,,richtext,6.0,,,,,,,,richtext,0.0,True,,,,,,,,False,,False,True,False,False,,[],[],False,/r/ValorantCompetitive/comments/st9dg1/was_this_iteration_of_deathmatch_playtested/,{},True,,False,False,,:100T::Skye::Jett::Omen::Sova::Cypher::V1::Raze::FaZe::Chamber:,[],,,,,,t5_2g5ach,,,,,#373c3f,,st9dg1,True,,Splaram,,66,True,,,,False,,False,dark,,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValorantCompetitive/comments/st9dg1/was_this_iteration_of_deathmatch_playtested/,all_ads,159607.0,1644948972.0,0.0,,,False,,3095812c-57e9-11ea-983c-0e43dae76e97,,1618298401.0,1654115544.0,1654115544.0,,,,,soundcamps,,,,,,,

The neutral: vendor prices. I get it but damn. Lines to get in were as expected.
The bad: sound bleed. Chads. The rumor mill.
The downright ugly: all the fucking laced drugs. Especially from the guy in the RV lot a ton of the laced stuff was traced back to. I hope you rot in a cell for the rest of your miserable life.

Communication from X’s team on Wednesday/Thursday 

General thoughts.
Holy fuck are all of you who camped &amp; got in and had a great weekend absolute champs. I cannot applaud you enough. Kudos to X for finally figuring it out and getting everyone in. To everyone who won’t stop bitching, I get it, but chill. X, Mr. Jeff, Livornooooo’s other half: the communication leading up to the festival until basically Friday was ATROCIOUS. Please be better. I assume the lack of info was due to decisions needing to be made to get people in safely.
The music: wow. We crossed genres all weeekend and didn’t find a set we didn’t enjoy. The artists really went all in this weekend.
The stages: THE NEW DESIGNS WOW. The sound bleed especially in the back needs to be fixed. I shouldn’t hear X playing during Boogie T. Overall massive upgrade for the soundcamps.

In general LOVED the festival expansion. I have faith the logistical issues will be addressed.


Attendees/rumor mill: test. Your. Fucking. Drugs. 
Massive shoutout to Bunk Police, Dancesafe, the very overworked medical staff &amp; security team who all went harder than ANYONE on the rail just trying to keep people safe. 

My thoughts are with the family of the person who OD’d at the Red Roof Inn pre festival.

,,soundcampaign," **Would not recommend - read my experience**

I would not recommend SoundCamps for those looking for true ""organic"" promotion.  


From my own experience, here is my reasoning.  


1. My genre of music (e.g. bedroom pop) I selected when I submitted the song, seemed to be sent to playlist curators of a completely different genre. One of the reviews I received said something like ""I wish I had a bedroom pop playlist"". After emailing with customer service, this seemed to be just an excuse for not reviewing the song.  


2. Playlists can be full of bots. My song was put into a playlist of over 22k follower and I strongly believe these were mainly bots (you can tell using Chartmetric and Spotify for Artists). The bots have IP addresses from about 5 major cities in the USA, Mexico etc. Almost everyone in the playlist has the same top city of Mexico City.  
This may seem like your song growing an audience but the truth is the steams are fake, it hurts your Spotify algorithm, as the song will be recommended to the wrong users (with random preferences of genre) and puts you at risk of being taken down by Spotify. Not to mention getting blacklisted from Spotify editorial playlists.  


3. After contacting Spotify for Artists regarding the latter, they advised me to ""\[review all\] promotional and marketing efforts"".  


4. Be aware that the ""Artist Protection Program"" only refunds money as credit in your account, so you are forced to spend it with them again. This leaves you in a bad situation if the curator does not review your song, which happened to me almost straight after ordering.  


5. The reviews I received had poor grammar/spelling, seemed very generic, and had poor attention to detail. I understand this is a worldwide service with users of different nationalities but this was not really good enough.  


6. I raised my issues with customer service, and instead of taking action to request (but not force, as I know they cannot do this) that the curator removes my song from the bot playlist, they asked me to pay for more of their 'services', at a discounted rate - I found this insulting. They have not offered any alternative way to help solve things.  


I do not want to spend more money, I want support and for the company to rectify for the service I already bought.  


In conclusion, SoundCamps makes no promises about the streams you will get, which makes it seem a better and safer option, and is why I chose them. But in my experience, curators ignored my song and didn't review it, I was added to a playlist of bots that ruins my statistics and reduces chances of growing, and I lost money where curators left a low effort review or no review at all.",t2_cmn5uafe,,,,,0.0,,,"A real SoundCampaign review, #2:",[],,,False,,,,,,,False,t3_o15f5j,,False,,dark,1.0,,,restricted,,self.soundcampaign,,,,,False,,,False,,False,,{},,,,1,,False,False,,self,False,,[],,{},,,,True,,,,text,,,,,,,,,text,0.0,False,,,,,,,,False,,True,True,False,False,,[],,False,/r/soundcampaign/comments/o15f5j/a_real_soundcampaign_review_2/,{},True,,False,False,,,[],,,,,,t5_4m0uu8,,,,,,,o15f5j,True,,Alan_Greenspin,,0,True,,,,False,,False,,,,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/soundcampaign/comments/o15f5j/a_real_soundcampaign_review_2/,,1.0,1623851613.0,0.0,,,False,,,,1623274784.0,,1624509109.0,,,,,soundcamps,,,,,,,
,,GalaxyS8,"I kinda have to get used to some things again, but I'm about an hour in right now and I'm already feeling pretty good about this. Got the S8 in Sept 2017, got a new battery in Aug 2019 and got my iPhone 11 in Dec 2020. 

Really missed some features such as the ""disable absolute volume"" setting since I like to listen to music at night, but am quite sensitive to loud sounds and when I turn absolute volume off, I have amazing control over my volume. Also just really like how customizable android is. 

Not to mention how great (in my experience) Samsung's support team is. I tweet them with an issue I'm having, and usually it's resolved within hours. Apple sometimes takes days to reply. I once even had a conversation with Samsung on Twitter by using just Adele-gifs. Like the actual singer, Adele.

I'll be using my S8 for at least a day. By the end of tomorrow night I'll probably switch back to the iPhone, but tbh thats just because it was so damn expensive (and also it's obviously faster and newer than the S8)

It's funny to me because when I first made the Samsung-Apple switch, a BUNCH of people asked me if I liked Apple better than Samsung and they all expected me to say yes, so they were quite shocked when I told them I like them both equally. I think I still prefer Samsung over Apple though, but then iPhones have great features as well. I mostly like iMessage and garageband (since soundcamp got discontinued). 

Sorry for the long post. I would've just summarized this and put it in a tweet, but people on there used to kinda mock me for having Samsung phones and I don't feel like listening to their dumb opinions, lol.

,,DJs,"I saw the post about open format DJing and that really got me thinking;

I started ""DJing"" when i was younger (like middle school) by using my laptop and my ipod both plugged into a stereo so that way I can have the next song ready when the last song ends.

I always played and produced music but got my first decks at 20 years old. Im coming up on the end of the first 5 years of my career and ive done some incredible stuff like running and playing my own house soundcamp at Lost Lands, or playing more open format at the local punk bar.

In this 5 year span ive played, turned down and been fired from open format gigs. I almost exclusively don't do open format nights because it started feeling like a paycheck and not a passion (like managing a McDonalds with your cordon bleu culinary degree). Of course the occasional pop song, remix, edit being thrown in is essential in any generic nightclub environment. As far as what made me become a DJ, that was my passion for house and hardcore. Its not even that i dont feel like a good open format DJ - as ill play across 75-130 BPM tracks through a standard session - but that I didnt become a DJ to play Dont Stop Believing (which is guranteed top 5 crowd reactions btw) We all know your wedding DJ and corporate DJ is the one making a living but i digress.


So i wonder - when you started DJing was the intention to do corporate and private events in an open format setting or just as a hobby playing your favorite songs? What advantages and disadvantages did this bring your career? Are you even DJing out enough to consider it part of your career?

My take - i wanted to play house music. I now run lights, visuals and sound at 2 different clubs in Chicago.

,,galaxys10,"These posts are a dime-a-dozen on this sub and similar subs, so I'll keep it brief. My first Galaxy was a Captivate (S1), but I only became a ""fanboy"" when I got my S5. I'm a recovered rooting/custom ROM addict, and Samsung devices had a lot of the features I wanted in custom ROMs, so I allowed myself to get used to the UI and I've been using Samsung phones since. I've watched other manufacturers step up as far as quality hardware and software, but there were two features I couldn't get from any other OEM: Soundcamp and MST. Samsung has/had the best Android MIDI implementation of any OEM as far as latency, and it was a real bummer when they killed Soundcamp and any further efforts into musician-focused software, although their MIDI implementation is still present and works great with DAWs that support it. Re: MST, I've become accustomed to leaving my wallet in my car (or worse, forgetting it at home) and knowing I can use my phone at any terminal (so long as it's not one where the card is fully inserted, like at gas pumps). I found out today that the S21 dropped MST support, and that's the last specific feature that kept me buying Samsung phones.

,,depression,"I’m 36 this year. I was a very happy in my pre teens. I was in to sports, tried to get in to teams but couldn’t because of my physical built. But I was happy. During my teens family moved to Rental cos my dad went broke. His brothers tricked him(long story). So I got disconnected from my best pals in my old place. I was shy and couldn’t make any new friends from the new place. I was hoping everyday that we could go back and have perm home like old days. I excelled in O/L exams. I had 2 friends during that time. Apparently they were in a relationship and they once tricked me to one their place and tried to rape me. I got away with it, and had to spend another 3 years around them until finish A/Ls. During last phase of academics the incident at that place came to haunt me with exams pressure. And I was losing focus. I had high tempered, and hated my self. I was thinking what a loser I was to be used as a puppet by so called friends . Who else knew about it. And what the fuck am I?. Parents had no idea and at the end I barely got through the exams. I tried my best to avoid any school friends after that. I got in to engineering school which I studied telecom. And still I was avoiding every reunions of college pals. Every time the college topic is brought up the incident came haunting back to me. I found love during my studies. And later after graduation got dumped as she was using me to get her secret partner to like her more. That was it. My parents knew about my relationship and I was so sure about it. And I was embarrassed to face my family afterwards. Now she’s expecting her second as I heard. I got tricked every time. I worked for 3 years and before I had like 2 years of on the job experience as a trainee. I had no problem doing my work, relationship with staff etc. but once I’m home, my life starts to haunt me. I have no strength left to approach anyone, I question my legitimacy every time. I have thought about it all the time to end it and may be I’ll ok in my next life but could find the courage even do that. I’m also a musician. I’ve played in big stages, done workshops, did a soundcamp in India with perera elsewhere, scored for a stage drama, made many friends through music, artists, directors etc. and I still everyday I feel empty and worthless at home.

,,modernwarfare,"Maybe there is a chance to save 6v6 modes but i feel like improving GW and adding maps there is the way to go. Its feels like BF4 sequel we never got, althought not as polished, still fun.

Ground war is like 10 times more fun then standart multiplayer. And i feel like streamers play that only aswell. Why?

1. Nonstop action

2. Cooperation with squad

3. Multiple playstyles working, you can be sniper, you can rush around, you can control choke, you can take shotgun and go anticamp staircase hitman. Any playstyle i have mood for works there

4. No soundcamping, or almost to noone, everyone is always blowing up and there are almost no footsteps campers because its not viable there

5. Way less campers

6. No sbmm

7. Some spawns are bad but overall spawning in GW still feels thousands time more rewarding then spawning in ONE EXACT FUCKING PLACE in 6v6 just to run around across half map to be killed by windowwarriors. You are never spawtrapped, you always have one point before defcon, i find hilarious that some people say they are spawntrapped in GW, of course you will be if you always choose HQ as spawn when you dont have to.. And spawning on squad is amazing feature taken from bf

Visibility should be buffed and vehicles changed and nerfed but otherwise GW is so superior to standart mp that i dont see any point of trying to save that mode.

Whenever i play standart mp it feels bland, boring, even if i go positive, there is no satisfaction, i will play only one life modes there probably. (And gunfight is amazing aswell!) 

Improve GW, add more maps and this cod will be huge, iam not saying scratch the classic multiplayer, you can try to save it, but imo GW is the way to go now.",t2_15mn7p,,,,,0.0,,,Just focus on Ground War and this game will live long,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",r/modernwarfare,,False,6.0,,,,,,,,,False,,light,,,,public,,self.modernwarfare,,,,,False,,,False,,False,,{},Discussion,False,,2,,,False,,self,False,,[],,{},,,,True,,,,richtext,6.0,,,,,,,,text,0.0,False,,,top,,,,,False,,False,True,False,False,,[],[],False,/r/modernwarfare/comments/dq2tuo/just_focus_on_ground_war_and_this_game_will_live/,{},True,,False,False,,,[],,,,,,t5_2r8qf,,,,,#343536,,dq2tuo,True,,rolandassassin,,13,True,,,,False,,False,,,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/dq2tuo/just_focus_on_ground_war_and_this_game_will_live/,all_ads,662004.0,1572607051.0,0.0,,,False,,6d537b28-80a3-11e9-ad94-0eb2f94cca3a,,1487740822.0,1586458064.0,,,,,,soundcamps,,,,,,,

,,samsung,"[In reference to this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/9tgsam/samsung_discontinuing_soundcamp/).

I did some research and found out that Soundcamp and iMPC were dependent on this but it was removed from devices after Pie came, rendering the apps unusable.

I'm getting an S10e and was hoping to use iMPC but the very few reviews I can find said it was broken, I assume because the Professional Audio System/pro audio kit it was dependent on is now gone.

Is there any known way to reinstall it onto devices with Android Pie? Any guidance would be appreciated, I'd really like to find a way to use the two apps, and I'm not even sure why they'd discontinue them.",t2_n52wk,,,,,0.0,,,Has there been a way to reinstall the removed Professional Audio System?,[],r/samsung,,False,6.0,,,,,,,,,False,,dark,,,,public,,self.samsung,,,,,False,,,False,,False,,{},Question,False,,1,,,,,self,False,,[],,{},,,,True,,,,text,6.0,,,,,,,,text,0.0,,,,,,,,,False,,True,True,False,False,,[],,False,/r/samsung/comments/bum931/has_there_been_a_way_to_reinstall_the_removed/,{},True,,False,False,,,,,,,,,t5_2rkar,,,,,,,bum931,True,,-eagle73,,0,True,,,,False,,False,,,all_ads,False,https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/bum931/has_there_been_a_way_to_reinstall_the_removed/,all_ads,74266.0,1559174528.0,0.0,,,False,,,,1430079503.0,1561084922.0,,,,,,soundcamps,,,,,,,

,,samsung,"I might be mistaken, but i was under the impression that some of the Samsung low latency audio fixes were available for the Tab S3. I have been searching for the Soundcamp app which I expected to be optomised for this, and able to interact with some of the hardware bits and pieces. Am I looking for the wrong thing? Is it discontinued or something? So far searching the play store brings up only plug ins, and not the original app. All the links I have found are dead ends.

Might there be a better app? Does anyone know the name of the hardware that works with Samsung devices for audio recording?

,,pocketoperators,"I am having a hell of a time trying to figure out my issue, and being a novice doesn't help.

I have recorded several tracks from my PO-20 into FL Studio 12 by using the Edison recorder to record while I jam live. I am ready to do another track (it's been a few weeks since the last one), and I cannot for the life of me get it to work. 

My input chain:
PO-20--&gt;3.5mm TRS (w/ TRS 1/4 adapter)--&gt; Steinberg UR22 mkII--&gt; USB --&gt; FL Studio 12--&gt; (ASIO4ALL v2 driver) Edison recorder set on channel 1 (same as PO is plugged into)

The ***only*** sound i can get is if I set it to SY1, and you hear the click track. Hard. No other SYC option will give me sound of any sort, at all. 

I don't understand what changed from the last time. I just plugged it in and recorded, pretty sure it was on SY0. I had never changed the SYC before so I'm not really sure. 

The thing is this- no program will take the sound signal. I tried numerous settings in FL and Audition on the PC. Then I plugged my Steinberg into my Samsung Galaxy S9+ with the USB OTG adapter and used Soundcamp to record- *it does the same thing.*

I don't get it. When I listen with headphones I get stereo with SY0, and the click track in left ear with SY1 like you should. But nothing will recognize the stereo track as an input.

,,androidapps,"I need some sort of portable setup for making music. I make mostly electronic indie pop-type music and get inspired often when I'm not at home with my main setup.

I have a Samsung Galaxy S7 and I know it was some great features for low latency recording. I have Soundcamp on my phone which seems fairly powerful, but it has a steep learning curve, not a great UI, and I'm not sure if it's worth buying any of the plugins if it ultimately can't do what I want.

**Any recommendations for a portable DAW on Android? Ideally with a few synths, a sequencer, and the ability to export.** I've started to explore Caustic, as that seems highly recommended. Any other suggestions?

Edit: I should clarify that recording audio is not a priority. It's more synth and sequenced.

,,BurningMan,"You're way too busy packing/planning/applying enough LEDs to turn La Victrola into a giant 1970's disco trumpet (this is a rumor I'm starting, feel free to roll with it....) but I'm sat on my ass so..... here are some off-the-beaten-path videos from (mostly) 2016.  I make no representation that they're ""the best"".  A few curios. A few that just make for background wallpaper on your connected TV, and a few interesting juxtapositions (a fairly fancy Catacombs video back to back with some silly Santa Hat nonsense....)  

Some Burning Man videos you can binge on... but only AFTER you've watched [24 Hours at Burning Man 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=An9qsRS_ODQ) ALL THE WAY TO THE END.

[The Sparkplug : Save the Burning Man mission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQX5AaRkXiA) - Dept. of WTF? Beings with a group of people with pillowcases over their heads being lead to an RV.... Bay Bridge footage (I love me some ""driving to Burning Man footage) ... 
 we are on someone else's trip, and it clocks in at over 30 minutes, which is nice if you're into that.... it appears to be 2013.... things are starting to get weird.... a bit heavy on rando soundcamp footage but def. not your generic Burning Man video... 

[Dollie Does Burning Man 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2fsE8SVQm8) -- It's a doll doing commentary on stuff at Burning Man.... and acro-yoga.... and buying coffee at center Camp. Dollie does not want hippies touching her coffee. You're going to love it, or you're dead inside/too busy angrily posting ""radical self reliance!"" comments on people's naive birgin questions on social media (basically the same thing).

[Time Lapse at Burning Man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiwnImtXSP4) a quick one minute palate cleanser....

[Burning Man 2015 MAZU - Goddess of the Empty Sea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZBRNbYbVOI) a ""proper"" documentary about the MAZU temple .... possibly best enjoyed with a side order of Accuracy Third podcast's [fascinating and slightly more raw take](https://accuracythird.com/2016/06/08/a3rd-05-bitten-by-the-temple-of-tetnus/) on the same build....

[Un long voyage - THE TEMPLE #1 @ Burning Man](https://youtu.be/H0Vn0I5fxj4) first part of a multi-part French (subtitled) doc on the 2106 Temple.... David Best at his best (do you see what I did there?)


[Burning Man 2016 Mushroom Man Aftermovie](https://youtu.be/hKusyQW5uPg) a fairly generic 4 minute highlight reel, but nice use of 747 and worth watching the start of it just for that...

[Drivable Kinetic Artwork Is Like Nothing Jay Leno Has Ever Seen | Jay Leno's Garage | CNBC Prime](https://youtu.be/oBH2bJSjfoE) Exactly what it sounds like, but a nice (short) close look at Henry Change's Valarian Steel art car.

[Burning Man 2016 - Catacomb of Veils - 4k](https://youtu.be/UrC_U9zUp2E) Suprisingly under-viewed video featuring some slickly shot dawn footage around the crowd at the Catacomb of Veils burn, set to some surprisingly shitty music that captures none of the ambience of that morning.  Seriously, if you check it out and decide ""ehhh... the music's not *that* bad"", the DJs you like are literally ruining Burning Man and when Burning Man is no longer a thing, it'll be your fault and I hope you're sorry. But yeah, the footage is pretty awesome.

[Burning Man 2016: Christmas at Spaghetti Taco Camp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js6YX8zTHj4) Why aren't there more videos of those kind of rando events you see listed in the Who What Where guide that you know in your heart are just going to be a dozen people with a silly idea and some booze, and maybe you'll cycle past and wave and smile, but certainly not stop, and could the video be just entirely unstructured and yet, ironically, that's the spirit of Burning Man, right here with some random burners in Santa hats... Well, here you go.

[what my eyes seen at burning man 2016](https://youtu.be/C-Nu2YfJ0KY) Y0u know that thing where some guy has a parachute and what looks like a big house fan strapped to his back?  Yup, that. And the dudes who do it.  Plus some other stuff like roller skating. 

[Burning Man 2016](https://youtu.be/HPpj0M6oY4Y) We don't need no steenkin' EDM clip reel.... if, like me, you just want to stick some background wallpaper on the TV, here's 45 minutes of pretty much just footage, complete with the occasionally annoying sound of wind blasting a microphone.  Some nice ""sitting on your ass watching Playa Pops footage"" if you stick with it (or skip ahead to 30 mins in)

[Burning Man 2016 - Freedom On The Playa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIATZQWEsUM) A charming Irish (?) gentleman kicks off his road trip with breakfast at Denny's and some RV rental issues, then you're in for another 30 minutes or so of on playa wallpaper.

,,Songwriters,"Any of you out there use any DAW apps for Android? There's a few high quality ones (FruityLoops mobile and another that I can't recall right now) that are going for 20 bucks in the app store, but I'd rather not spend that, as I'm more or less going to be using it for simple things, such as saving ideas, exporting to midi for sheet music purposes, etc. 

Soundcamp came pre-installed on my phone, and while it works flawlessly, it is quite limited as far as features and voices. 

It definitely needs to be compatible with midi input and USB interfaces such as the iRig. (you'd think that would go without saying, but you'd be surprised what people try to pass as pro-audio apps on the play store.)

,,BurningMan,"Hey All, I heard that there is quite a bit of trance / house / EDM style music on the playa, so I'd like to balance the scales a bit with some [cheeky remixes / bootlegs](https://soundcloud.com/senorpeludo/remix-adventure-summer-edition-bootlegs-mashups-remixes) of classic rock / pop / hip-hop tracks plus a bit of funk, breakbeat, disco and (if folks want it) [dnb bootlegs](https://www.mixcloud.com/senorpeludo/dnb-bootlegs-and-dancehall-mix/). I play this stuff frequently on the East Coast, it's lots of fun and always good to get a crowd moving and smiling. 
[Here's a recent sample mix](https://soundcloud.com/senorpeludo/remix-adventure-summer-edition-bootlegs-mashups-remixes) (same as first link above) and [my profile on soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/senorpeludo).

I'm already booked (and very excited) to play at one soundcamp, but seeing as I'm bringing a bunch of tunes anyway (on CD and USB) I thought I'd offer my services to any other sound camps with CDJs who'd be interested in this sort of music.

Yeah, and I know everyone's a DJ and plenty of people are looking for gigs, no biggie. Just thought some folks might like something a bit different.

,,BurningMan,"I want to make a sort of Passport of things to see and do and would love it if everyone chimed in with their favorite spots and why they love them. (I know I know, wandering around is the best, but there may be some spots people don't consider going to).

Places I love:
1) Hardly at 4:30 and A(need to confirm for 2016)- well I camp there for one and consider it one of the best Bars on the Playa. It's a 24 hour shot Bar with a dance floor out front and a lot of fun events.
2) Golden Cafe at the BR French Quarter 7:30ish and B?- really awesome daytime bar with good live music. I think I saw Seth Rogan there, but well you know...
3) Barbie Death Camp (7:30ish)- just awesome
4) Thunderdome 4:00 and Esplanade- Master Blaster says EMBARGO! Just killer to watch beautiful people bash each other with Nerf
5) Distrikt 9:00 and G- one of my favorite daytime soundcamps. Bike parking is stoopid and there is piss everywhere but I love it anyway. Killer, wonderful bunch of people.
6)Ride on the Robot Heart- find it and try to climb aboard or just hang out and watch....whatever, it's all good. I love a lot of their DJ's.
7) Mayan Warrior Art Car- just fantastic
8) HOTD near Rods Road- Another really cool bar. Runs 24 hours, lots of fun.
9) Pink Mammoth- Great DJs and dranks. Daytime party.
10) Bubbles and Bass- just reminds me of the scene where Dumbo ties one on.
11) Daft Punk Annual Party out in the  Deep Playa strait out from the temple most of the way out to the trash fence. BeTs drop at sundown on Wednesday. Do not miss this one brohs.
12) I'll keep adding as I remember things but please all throw out props for your favorite things to do.
13) Strap one on at the Black Rock Roller Disco
14) Make out with a like minded individual on the Ferris Wheel. Its terrifying, and someone will eventually die, but oh what a ride.
15) Grab your sack and ride on the slip and slide thingies

TLDR- post your favorite camps or things to do.

,,BurningMan,"Six months ago or so I re-wrote the lyrics to Sound of Music's ""My Favorite Things"" to be about Burning Man, then had a female vocalist record it, and set it to a (admittedly weird) video montage from Sound of Music and Burning Man. https://youtu.be/4waa6wy7cSw

To decompress every year, I work on photos and video, but I've now completed those and am considering doing another song based on the Beach Boy's ""California Girls."" 

Just curious what you guys think. There aren't enough lyrics in the original song for my taste, so am considering adding another verse, but here's what I have so far:

""Well Esplanade girls are hip

I really dig those styles they wear

And the Thunderdome girls with the way they swing

They knock me out when I'm down there!


The soundcamp sparkleponies really make you feel alright

And the back street girls with their evap ponds

They keep their boyfriends warm at night!


I wish they all could be Black Rock City girls!

I wish they all could be Black Rock City girls!


The playa has the sunshine

And the girls all get so tanned

I dig a bacon martini at a theme camp at dawn

Dolls by an art piece in the sand


I been all around this great big city

And I seen all kinds of girls

Yeah but I can't wait to get back to the desert

Back to the best damn girls in the world.


I wish they all could be Black Rock City girls! (etc etc)""


Two questions:
1) Is it at all entertaining? I'm kind of on the fence. I was much happier with the lyrics I did for My Favorite Things - more room for creativity I felt like.

2) Does it feel misogynistic? Referring to our lovely women Burners as girls is....possibly problematic maybe? ""I wish they all could be Black Rock City women"" doesn't have the same ring to it though....

,,audiophile,"There is something to be said about the power of music. For me, it has been life changing.

My journey started whilst scrolling through BHPhoto sales. I saw a Fiio amp on sale. I'm a curious person, so I started researching the crap out of what it was. I hadn't realized that High-Quality audio was a thing. I thought Bose was the best you could get, boy was I wrong.

Weeks later, I bought my first piece of decent audio gear: A Fiio E07K. I instantly noticed a difference in the quality of my music. What I felt listening to that the first time was a sort of bliss. I compare it to the first time my dad bought an HDTV, replacing the old, square, pixelated box. I craved to experience that more, to listen to music in a religious way.

I dug up all my old CDs, found all my old music and got as much as I could in FLAC or WAV. I noticed a lot of difference from typical 192kbps MP3s.

I soon found myself in a predicament, my phone didn't work with the E07K and my morning commute was depressing as far as music went. As soon as the Fiio X1 was released, I bought it. In fact, I think I got one of the first hundred units to ship in America. One day the battery of my X1 died and I resorted to my phone. I couldn't believe that anyone accepted that quality.

My experience hasn't been flawless. There has been much push-back from friends and family. They claim that I'm wasting my money and that it doesn't make a difference. To me, it very much does. Forget the naysayers, I was finally able to convince some friends to get some AT headphones and a Fiio desktop DAC. I also finally convinced a handful of people to not pirate music, which I deeply hate, but that's a different story.

My appreciation for audio took a turn I would have never expected. I began to produce and mix my own music. It started as jamming keys into a synth to actually learning keyboard. There was also a social aspect to the discovery of music. I became somewhat of a SoundCloud sensation. Note:I hate the SoundCloud streaming quality but love the platform and discover tools. I became much less active in spreading my love of music through Soundcamp and resorted to BandCamp. It filled a void in my playlists, and I loved the lossless downloads. People actually started coming to me for help discovering new genres and I always wanted to help (sans country, that's not my kind of music) Heck, I even started paying attention to television soundtracks, and that's where I discover a third of my music today.

Then, there's a truly life changing moment. I had been diagnosed with a mix of anxiety, depression and OCD, and my mind raced profusely. Whenever I was having trouble, I always went to music. This time, the music practically cured me. Most of my symptoms were gone. Music had literally saved my life. No amount of medicine could do me as much good as music, no amount of drugs could get me as high as I am on music. Music has empowered me more than anything else in my life.

I'd never really put a lot of money into music, but I realized it was time, it mattered. I had gotten very passionate, however this gear still wasn't enough, that's when I decided to dig deep and work hard. As I write this, I have new gear being shipped or in a shopping cart. (List at the end)

I want to thank the entire audiophile community across the entire world. What you does matters, it changes lives. I believe it was destiny that I saw that silly amp on sale, and opened a door to a whole other world. I couldn't imagine my life with out it.

I hate the fact that this is such a niche, yet that's also one of the reasons I love it best. It's very unique, and I like that.

Here's my 2015 gear

**Portable**

Fiio X1, Fiio E07K, UE Pro 4s

Schiit Modi 2/Magni 2/SYS, Sennheiser HD 598, Emotiva 5s
