This is my 6th studio album release as a self funded artist playing acoustic rock with very minimal commerical success. 

For my latest album, I recorded overseas in Austin, Texas and decided to put as much strategy as possible into marketing my latest single, an upbeat pop-punk, fast tune as best I could.

I've tried a number of different techniques: playing open mics, playing album releases, touring, submithub, playlistpush with limited success. I reached a max of 3,000 streams on Spotify and some isolated community radio plays.

I asked around and was advised to hire a PR company to try to ""break into radio."" Here in Australia we have only one station to promote new artists that aren't signed to a major label, and that is Triple J, a government funded station with a quota for a number of Australian artists they have to play each week. 

I approached a number of different agencies with minimal success, the only agency who took me seriously was Beehive PR, based in Manly, Sydney. I spent $1500 AUD (about a month's rent, approx $1000 USD) for ""Editorials and Radio Pitching."" They were a pleasure to deal with, very professional, slick and easy, but I 
- barely saw 1,000 streams on Spotify, 
- had a total of three write ups on small magazines, with no new followers on social media as a result
- and the same isolated community radio play I had without a PR company. 

I asked about larger radio stations, namely the pop-punk and heavy show short.fast.loud on Triple J and was told unfortunately they had ""passed"" on the track. 

At this point, I'm really lost. I don't know what to do. I think either
a) my music stinks
b) there's something I'm missing here, whether it's a paywall/labels in control of triple J/marketing/social media.
c) something else.

At Boost Collective, we understand how important it is to get your music heard by as many people as possible. One way to do this is by getting your music featured on popular Spotify playlists. However, finding the right playlist curators and getting in touch with them can be a daunting task. That's why we've put together this comprehensive guide on how to find Spotify playlist curators and contact them effectively.

# Why are Spotify Playlists Important?

Spotify playlists are a powerful tool for promoting your music. They are a collection of songs curated by a playlist creator and can be found by millions of Spotify users worldwide. Getting your music on a popular playlist can increase your streams, gain you new fans, and ultimately help you grow your career as a musician.

How to Find Spotify Playlist Curators

### 1. Use Third-Party Curator Websites

There are many websites that list popular Spotify playlists and their curators. Some of the most popular ones include:

* Soundplate: This website has a large database of Spotify playlists and their curators, making it a great resource for finding the right playlists to target.
* SubmitHub: SubmitHub allows you to submit your music directly to playlist curators, as well as music bloggers and record labels.
* PlaylistPush: This website connects independent artists with Spotify playlist curators for a fee.

### 2. Use Spotify Search

You can also use Spotify's search function to find playlists related to your music genre. Simply search for a relevant keyword, such as ""indie rock,"" and select the ""Playlists"" tab. This will show you a list of playlists related to that keyword, along with their curators.

### 3. Use Social Media

Many playlist curators have a strong social media presence. You can use platforms like Twitter and Instagram to find and follow playlist curators in your music genre. Engage with their content and build a relationship with them before pitching your music.

## How to Contact Spotify Playlist Curators

### 1. Personalize Your Pitch

When contacting playlist curators, it's important to personalize your pitch. Show that you have taken the time to listen to their playlist and explain why your music would be a good fit.

### 2. Be Professional

Make sure your email is professional and well-written. Avoid using slang or overly casual language. You want to come across as a serious artist who is worth adding to their playlist.

### 3. Follow up

If you don't hear back from a playlist curator, don't be afraid to follow up. But be sure to give them enough time to listen to your music before doing so. A polite follow-up email can help you stand out from other artists and increase your chances of getting featured.

### Conclusion

Getting your music on popular Spotify playlists can be a game-changer for your career as a musician. By following the tips outlined in this guide, you can increase your chances of finding the right playlist curators and getting your music heard by a wider audience.

y6bql5,1666014429.0,MusicPromotion,kpaxkpaxkpax,The problem with Playlistpush,"Curators on this platform have their playlists active when they meet activity requirements which are:

&amp;#x200B;

* Minimum 30 Active Monthly Listeners per playlist
* Minimum 1% Active Monthly Listeners per playlist

It is written in their web that they calculate the active monthly listeners accessing to Spotify listening data. However, Spotify doesn't publish this data, and Playlistpush mainly calculates the active monthly listeners asking an screenshot of their spotify for artist to the people who has sent their tracks through the platform.

Musicians only can see the top 50 playlists that make more streams to the track, so the problem here is that if musicans have a lot of monthly listeners they won't have any data of small playlists. 

So, curators will only accept songs from musicians that have few streams, otherwise their playlists won't show up at their spotify for artist and playlistpush will lower curators' playlist score. 

If their minimum active listeners is 30, small curators won't accept any track with more than 1000-2000 monthly listeners, for example.

I started with putting just a few dollars in Submithub, and got my first (and biggest) playlist add, gaining over 8000 streams in total from that playlist. It was removed from the playlist after one week. So I invested some more in Submithub and got a few placements. The placements were quite unimpressive for the most part. 

I heard from Groover trough reddit, and decided to try it out. I got a lot of placements, but they weren’t that high quality. 

Since I started getting a lot of streams from this one big playlist, I got excited and decided to splurge in a Playlist Push campaign, spending over 300 dollars. This campaign was by far the most dissapointing. I had very little control over the playlists it was getting pitched to, and most of the responses said: ”I love this track!! It sounds amazing!!! Unfortunately I don’t have a playlist this would fit in”. I thought I would get high quality feedback, since I spent so much money, but the feedback was as good as anywhere else. 

The Omari campaign was weird. It says you get a certain amount of streams and you do get it trough some odd playlist adds. But the streams seem to be quite low quality.

qi68sh,1635487970.0,musicmarketing,iplaythelaptop,Manipulating Spotify Streams with Streaming Fraud: Here’s What Can Happen," The current era of music consumption is heavily dominated by streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music. Music distribution has become easier and very efficient, and almost every song is available to everyone across the globe. Streaming is a process that, on paper, proves to be a win-win situation for everyone involved. The artist is paid more as their **Spotify streams** increase, while the listener can listen to any song without going through the hassle of downloading it beforehand. However, with the number of streams also acting as some sort of a status symbol, a lot of naive indie artists have been getting tempted to try it, and streaming fraud is becoming more and more commonplace in the industry. However, it can easily ruin the trajectory of an artist’s career. 

## What is Streaming Fraud?

Streaming fraud refers to illegal practices that can be used by artists to increase their **Spotify streams** or forge the statistics on a streaming platform like Spotify. In this, artists pay for streams that are registered by bots or even real people hired to stream tracks, also known as ‘artificial streams.’  This is a very common phrase in the music industry and is also often referred to as ‘streaming manipulation,’ ‘store-end fraud,’ and ‘abnormal streaming activity.’ The problem with streaming fraud runs even deeper than buying illegal music. In some cases, you might not even realize that you are partaking in streaming fraud. Several independent playlist curators claim to be legitimate but are actually using illegal methods to increase **Spotify streams** for its customers. You should always research a Spotify playlist curator before paying them for consideration to their playlists and use only reputable services like SubmitHub, PlaylistPush and StreamCatcher to pitch your music. Buying fake **Spotify streams** is becoming increasingly commonplace. There are a lot of popular third-party sites that offer to provide artists with a specific amount of streams and **Spotify playlist** placements in exchange for money. These parties, then, usually generate fake streams using bots. And even though it has become easier for people to manipulate streaming, Spotify has been working very hard to try and implement measures to control it and to be a safer space for genuine artists.    

## Why Streaming Fraud Isn’t Worth It  

### 1. You Can be Suspended or Removed

With cases of streaming frauds rising, streaming platforms have been taking measures to prevent and punish streaming frauds routinely. If it is ever found that your account has done any illegal activities to increase your streams, strict action can be taken against you. Once you have been caught, your account can be suspended for a long time or, in some cases, be deleted permanently. This will lead you to start the process of distributing music from scratch. If you’re any serious about having a long-term career as a musician, this just isn’t worth the risk.   

### 2. You Lose Your Reliability

A higher number of **Spotify streams** does not mean you are more talented or have a higher chance of becoming successful than other musicians, and fans usually pick up on that. In fact, it can often mean the opposite. If you send your music to a label and they find out that your streams are not real (it’s often obvious), you lose your credibility as an artist. This will hamper your future and might ruin your career. The label can also share this information with the industry making it almost impossible for you to gain footing again. Again, just not worth it.  

### 3. It is Illegal and There Are Safer Options Out There

At the end of the day, it boils down to the fact that you might just be wasting your time, effort, and money. You can instead use the time and money you'd be spending on these illegal payola sites in a better, more effective way to legally get more streams (and real fans) from your music! Again, make sure you always use a reputable Spotify curator. Other than that, you can research music marketing and learn how to engage more listeners and increase your audience. There will be several services on the internet that will claim that they can increase your streams by large margins, but taking shortcuts in the present can prove to be harmful in the long run.   

### 4. It Relies on Taking Revenue From Other Independent Artists

Lastly but very importantly, the artists on streaming platforms are paid according to the number of streams their music generates. But since the majority of streaming platforms work on a revenue system known as a ‘shared pool,’ getting fake streams also translates into stealing from the pockets of other, more deserving artists. If fake **Spotify streams** are muddling the numbers, the money won’t be given to the small independent artists who deserve it. Here are some other common and effective ways in which you can promote your music instead:

* Promoting your music on social media via TikToks, Reels and YouTube Shorts
* Promoting your music with the help of Facebook ads
* Pitching your songs to **Spotify editorial playlists** *(during the time of release)*
* Using Spotify For Artist' countless tools to promote your new releases
* Pitch your music to **user-generated** playlists

You might think that fake streams are very hard to trace, but that is not the case. Industry professionals can distinguish very easily between real and fraudulent **Spotify streams**. In the future, fake streams will just make it worse for you to get more exposure and growth. So when promoting music, choose what you do wisely and always go for the reliable and trustworthy option.

Music distribution has become easier and very efficient, and almost every song is available to everyone across the globe. Streaming is a process that, on paper, proves to be a win-win situation for everyone involved. The artist is paid more as their **Spotify streams** increase, while the listener can listen to any song without going through the hassle of downloading it beforehand. However, with the number of streams also acting as some sort of a status symbol, a lot of naive indie artists have been getting tempted to try it, and streaming fraud is becoming more and more commonplace in the industry. However, it can easily ruin the trajectory of an artist’s career.   What is Streaming Fraud? Streaming fraud refers to illegal practices that can be used by artists to increase their **Spotify streams** or forge the statistics on a streaming platform like Spotify. In this, artists pay for streams that are registered by bots or even real people hired to stream tracks, also known as ‘artificial streams.’  This is a very common phrase in the music industry and is also often referred to as ‘streaming manipulation,’ ‘store-end fraud,’ and ‘abnormal streaming activity.’ The problem with streaming fraud runs even deeper than buying illegal music. In some cases, you might not even realize that you are partaking in streaming fraud. Several independent playlist curators claim to be legitimate but are actually using illegal methods to increase **Spotify streams** for its customers. You should always research a Spotify playlist curator before paying them for consideration to their playlists and use only reputable services like SubmitHub, PlaylistPush and StreamCatcher to pitch your music. Buying fake **Spotify streams** is becoming increasingly commonplace. There are a lot of popular third-party sites that offer to provide artists with a specific amount of streams and **Spotify playlist** placements in exchange for money. These parties, then, usually generate fake streams using bots. And even though it has become easier for people to manipulate streaming, Spotify has been working very hard to try and implement measures to control it and to be a safer space for genuine artists.      Why Streaming Fraud Isn’t Worth It    1. You Can be Suspended or Removed With cases of streaming frauds rising, streaming platforms have been taking measures to prevent and punish streaming frauds routinely. If it is ever found that your account has done any illegal activities to increase your streams, strict action can be taken against you. Once you have been caught, your account can be suspended for a long time or, in some cases, be deleted permanently. This will lead you to start the process of distributing music from scratch. If you’re any serious about having a long-term career as a musician, this just isn’t worth the risk.     2. You Lose Your Reliability A higher number of **Spotify streams** does not mean you are more talented or have a higher chance of becoming successful than other musicians, and fans usually pick up on that. In fact, it can often mean the opposite. If you send your music to a label and they find out that your streams are not real (it’s often obvious), you lose your credibility as an artist. This will hamper your future and might ruin your career. The label can also share this information with the industry making it almost impossible for you to gain footing again. Again, just not worth it.    3. It is Illegal and There Are Safer Options Out There At the end of the day, it boils down to the fact that you might just be wasting your time, effort, and money. You can instead use the time and money you'd be spending on these illegal payola sites in a better, more effective way to legally get more streams (and real fans) from your music! Again, make sure you always use a reputable Spotify curator. Other than that, you can research music marketing and learn how to engage more listeners and increase your audience. There will be several services on the internet that will claim that they can increase your streams by large margins, but taking shortcuts in the present can prove to be harmful in the long run.     4. It Relies on Taking Revenue From Other Independent Artists Lastly but very importantly, the artists on streaming platforms are paid according to the number of streams their music generates. But since the majority of streaming platforms work on a revenue system known as a ‘shared pool,’ getting fake streams also translates into stealing from the pockets of other, more deserving artists. If fake **Spotify streams** are muddling the numbers, the money won’t be given to the small independent artists who deserve it. Here are some other common and effective ways in which you can promote your music instead * Promoting your music on social media via TikToks, Reels and YouTube Shorts * Promoting your music with the help of Facebook ads * Pitching your songs to **Spotify editorial playlists**  *(during the time of release)* * Using Spotify For Artist' countless tools to promote your new releases * Pitch your music to **user-generated** playlists You might think that fake streams are very hard to trace, but that is not the case.

For those who don't know, PlaylistPush markets itself as the **ultimate tool for playlist submission**.  Having hundreds if not a thousand of curators, they assure you that  your song will be sent to the right pair of ears - something that was  too pretty to be true.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*""We send your music to a targeted group of playlist curators, they review your song for playlist consideration""*

and

&gt;*""We have the most active network of Spotify curators and measure data from each campaign for maximum effectiveness""*

are  both quotes taken from the home page of the website - doesn't it sound  like the best way to reach new fans by using their highly advanced  service?

&amp;#x200B;

This is how you usually submit a song:

1. the song has to be approved by PlaylistPush moderators before being able to set up a campaign
2. once  approved, you can set up your campaign by choosing your budget (minimum  $300), and by specifying the multiple genres of your song - **""pop, alt pop, electronic pop"" were mine**
3. next,  you only have to pay them and schedule your campaign. The song will  then be sent to a certain number of curators in the genres you specified  and they will have 14 days to either add you to their playlist or  simply tell you why they wouldn't - the more you pay, the more curators  you will reach ;)

&amp;#x200B;

I personally paid $300 for my campaign, which is equivalent to 44 curators reached according to the website.

My results after 5 days out of 14: 1 playlist add out of 8

not  so bad would you say? The only playlist that added me, not only had 3K  likes but is also almost inactive due to the non existent traffic I got  off it.

Now, time for the reviews  of the playlists that did not accept me. I would like to remind you that  the genres I specified were pop, alt pop and electronic pop - **lots of pop, if not only pop**.

what is even the ""collaboration element"" and how can you be a fan or not of it?!?

the very best for the very end

&amp;#x200B;

So  far, I feel like I have been abused by the PlaylistPush service - not  only their reviews are similar to the ones you get on SubmitHub (another  great tool for musicians am I right ;) ) but you also **pay ten times more for them to write you that!!!!!!!!**

They are LITERALLY a scam, nothing more.

And  if my song was so trash, why did the PlaylistPush staff even accept it?  Sent me multiple reminder emails that my ""campaign is waiting"" and  offered me a discount code?

mpy01i,1618302080.0,spotifyplaylist,Roark_Records,[REQUEST] - Looking for some advice on a playlist project for unheard/underground/hip hop gems,"I have a friend who is an up and coming artist releasing their first few  tracks and the amount of scams/snakes (obviously not everybody) on  Spotify curator sites like Submithub or Playlistpush where the curator just basically asks for money for a placement, what happened to the  actual quality of the music?

We  are going to have a strict no-payment for placement policy regardless of  how much they would hypothetically offer. We want to give the artists  at least some power to get heard and **organically grow through the playlists**.

The main concept is we have a four playlists setup with the following guidelines:

A. songs with under 1,000 streams

B. songs with 1,000-9,999 streams

C. songs with 10,000-99,999 streams

D. songs with 100,000-999,999 streams

As  the artist grows, they tier up, they can grow up to the top of the  playlist, it can form a community of up and comers, collaborations, and  an opportunity for hip hop and music lovers to discover and be a part of potentially the next big thing (which can be an incredible feeling!). We will follow the metrics closely and continuously update the playlists  and can provide an incredible organic experience when they ""level up"" to the next tier of the playlist!

Let  me know what you guys think of the concept and if you have any artists  in mind that are looking for opportunities to actually grow through Spotify playlists without all the bots bullshit or shelling out money to BS agencies, feel free to share with them and would love to hear their  feedback as well. Feel free to DM here or if you prefer email, you can  catch me at [submissions@roarkrecords.com](mailto:submissions@roarkrecords.com)

Let  me know what you guys think of the concept and if you have any artists  in mind that are looking for opportunities to actually grow through Spotify playlists without all the bots bullshit or shelling out money to BS agencies, feel free to share with them and would love to hear their  feedback as well.

ih4p6s,1598467446.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,TheRealKaiLord,PSA: How to tell when Spotify playlists and plays are fake,"We all see shit like this:

""10-15k Guaranteed plays on 12 Playlists for $50 - get your music heard!""

If  you message these people they will send you a bunch of screen shots  from satisfied customers, some will be small time artists, some will be  huge with 200k + followers.

Some might be successful, but most will only have 'bot clout.'

It's really hard to tell when someone's Spotify is just bots if you don't know what to look for - here is what to look for.

Monthly  listeners to total plays - If they have 50k plays on their top song,  and 40k monthly listeners, they recently bought all of those plays.  Because if they really had that kind of listener base MONTHLY, their  total plays would be way higher.

Monthly  listeners to followers - If they have 40k monthly listeners and 300  followers, no one really fucks with them, they paid for the plays.

Where  people are listening - If you see cities like, Los Angeles, Dallas,  Phoenix, Kansas City, Buffalo, London GB, Frankfurt, etc.. these cities  are big data centers where botters can buy a whole bunch of IP addresses  to do fake shit. No one gets above 10% of their listeners from Dallas  unless they are a local act. So getting above 10% from multiple large  cities is simply impossible.

Before  you go checking every spotify playlist promotion to see which ones give  'real' results and which ones are fake... let me spoil it for you. They  are all fake.

Here are the things  that are difficult to do, expensive, still full of bullshit, but can  potentially work (that I'm aware of) submithub, playlistpush and good  old emailing/messaging individual playlist owners

Also,  if you're thinking, meh, I'll do it anyway for the clout, it'll make  other people listen and follow because I'll seem successful. Be the fuck  ware. Because Spotify has come down on bot plays and will again. You do  not want their visible or invisible ban hammer to come down upon you.

If you message these people they will send you a bunch of screen shots from satisfied customers, some will be small time artists, some will be huge with 200k  followers. Some might be successful, but most will only have 'bot clout.'  It's really hard to tell when someone's Spotify is just bots if you don't know what to look for - here is what to look for.  Monthly listeners to total plays - If they have 50k plays on their top song, and 40k monthly listeners, they recently bought all of those plays. Because if they really had that kind of listener base MONTHLY, their total plays would be way higher. Monthly listeners to followers - If they have 40k monthly listeners and 300 followers, no one really fucks with them, they paid for the plays. Where people are listening - If you see cities like, Los Angeles, Dallas, Phoenix, Kansas City, Buffalo, London GB, Frankfurt, etc.. these cities are big data centers where botters can buy a whole bunch of IP addresses to do fake shit. No one gets above 10% of their listeners from Dallas unless they are a local act. So getting above 10% from multiple large cities is simply impossible. Before you go checking every spotify playlist promotion to see which ones give 'real' results and which ones are fake... let me spoil it for you. They are all fake.

New to this community, I did read through the commonly asked questions and still just wanted to get a feel for others' experiences out there. I have a band, fairly newly formed, but has kind of built a small amount of momentum.   
We do all the self promotion stuff, have used submithub and submitlink, gone through the tedious processes of finding playlist curators and reaching out directly, all that stuff, basically if it can be done for free, we have and continue to do it.  
Personally, I do not like submithub or submitlink, and it has a lot to do with our music. We do reggae rock, and often the feedback is overwhelmingly positive, but we are either too heavy or not heavy enough to be appropriate for playlists, though we have gotten onto a few pretty good ones - its just not nearly the success rate that would make me want to continue to throw funds at these sites.   


The majority of our plays now come from spotify radio, which is nice, but we really want to see what we can do to push it to another level.   


We have a song releasing March 1st, and I am contemplating using Spotify Marquee, but there is so much conflicting information online. I have also heard good things about groover and haven't tried it, same with Playlist push.

Hi, i’m here to share my experience on SubmitHub, hoping to be usefull for someone.

I’ve  used this service for a couple of song, and since it’s a long post, i  want to start with the most faq i’ve read on reddit about this.

Yes  this website is legit, and it’s a great idea, should you use it? It’s  all about lucky, i probably won’t use it anymore, not because of the  service, that does what it should and the founder it’s always on the  chat to help and talk with people, but because curators, at least in my  experience, they are not open minded to listen something that try to  bring something different on the scene, there is a reason why we are  artists and not someone who clean a window, if i wanted to copy somone  else i whould chose another job.

With  the premium credits you will receive the feedback from curators, but  are not really helpfull, because someone could say your vocal is awesome  but the instrumental suck, and another one the opposite. My last song  was declined for sharing by all curators i’ve submitted, i want to copy  here all the feedback, because i think it worth reading to have an idea,  ofc i wont write who they are, but just the feedback.

**Feadback (all declined)**

Great  tune, loved the vocal as well as the bubbling house vibes on the  baseline. The drop is quite fresh and well produced and overall the  track sounds really fresh. Unfortunately, it's a bit too relaxing and  deep for us, sorry

""Fearless""  offers a very accessible and energetic Progressive House sound, the  melodic arrangements are impressive and super uplifting, the track has a  great deep invigorating energy and nice enigmatic ambiance, however,  although it is a quality production, it unfortunately wasn't quite  compelling enough for a blog feature, I'm sorry

Thanks  for submitting! I like the very nostalgic and sweet melodies of the  song but the drop is not as energetic as I expected, the kick is a  little too thin and flat and the bass not deep.

Hey  there, Cool instrumental and very vibey sound design &amp; chords !  We're not caught by the vocals on this one though. Thanks for sending

Good  production enjoyable beat and vocal arrangements unfortunately not  convinced on the melody so let's try your next thanks for submitting

Hey,  the intro and the vocals soudns really great of course but actually  dont really like the beat drop. Next time you should work a bit more on  it in my opinion.

Hey there, thanks for the submission. Instrumental is fine but vocal is not what we are looking for qualitywise. Sorry!

thanks  for submitting Fearless. Been so pumped with teh vocal, sadly the drop  turned out a bit too different than we expected. Hoped for a big  epxlisive one! :(

Hey, good track,  good production. I like the instrumental. Unfortunately I am not a fan  of the vocals. They sound too standard to me. Unfortunately they don't  kick me. Therefore, in this case I must decline. Nevertheless I wish you  a lot of success with this song! I'm sure it will find its fans. Thanks  for sending!

Nice instrumental. We don't feel the vocals enough. Thanks for submitting it to us

This  started of pretty good, really nice pads and great pluck. The vocal was  ok, it didnt sound great at times which didnt really let me enjoy the  song much. The production was quite clean but I didn't really enjoy the  drop much - it was missing alot of elements to keep it interesting.  Great concept though just needs a bit more work - Thanks for sending

the  song sounded quite good. This was definitely some high quality  production - The mix was dope and the elements used were good. The  melodies were catchy! Good job! Sadly here, i wasn't hooked by the vocal  topline (lyrics and melodies). Indeed, i felt like it was a bit  repetitive and linear for my personal tastes. I didn't feel like it was  professional enough.. :/ I know most people will love the song, but it  didn't convince me enough for me to support in my list this time. But  thank you for your submission. Have a good day and stay safe!

Even  though the song is not suitable for my playlist, cause I find it too  chill and not that commercial, I want to highlight the originality of  the instrumental

Hey, the mix and  master sounds really clean but actually dont really like the break  melody. Next time you should work more on it.

Hey  Frankie, thanks for reaching out. The idea is cool and it has  potential, but I'm afraid the mixing quality and the sound desing here  still sounds quite weak and messy, there's no contrast betweent the  different sections of the song.. not really meeting our quality  standards for a feature this time, I'm sorry. Wish you good luck with  your song release!

It's a  wonderful summer melody and music production is well done, but we  expected more developed progression..Anyway, keep creating

The  energy in the song is nice here. So not bad. But also a bit too beat  driven I would say as I was missing a more melodic production here to  make the song stand out enough for me. So not all the way this time.

I appreciate the songwriting, but I wasn't into the final mix of Fearless nor the vocal performance.

what we didn't enjoy here is unoriginal melodies, keep on, your voice is amazing

not a fan of the drop here but just my taste

Thanks  for submitting but I'm going to pass. The song has solid production  that sets a nice tone but vocally I feel the song could be stronger to  my personal ear. Best of luck to you

Congrats  on the single. Lovely dance. That ending wasn't what the beginning of  the song was teasing. Was hoping for a huge ending. But that's just us  FT. Nice house, indeed. Keep on kickin' as you do. Sorry couldn't pull  the trigger. Enjoy the accolades.

Cool  vibe on the soundscape and vocals. There's definitely some talent  there. For me, I would like to hear a more defining hook that we can  sink our teeth into overall though. This one felt a little too one note  for placement.

Super impressive  but sadly did get a bit repetitive for me. Surely might circle back  around to this one though after giving it some time and will reach  out..!

Production is really dope  here. Vocals need a little development, sonically fell a little short  for us. Keep it up though, production is dope

The intro got me hooked! The drop was however very underwhelming. I'd try adding a lead to it so it can shine!

Good  production. The track feels, however, a little on the familiar side and  might benefit from adding fresher sound elements, twists and turns to  really take off and stand out that much more in this genre.

Great  tune, loved the vocal as well as the bubbling house vibes on the  baseline. The drop is quite fresh and well produced and overall the  track sounds really fresh. Unfortunately, it's a bit too relaxing and  deep for us, sorry

The highs of  this song sound a little bit strange. Would work on that to get a proper  final track because the melody has a really good potential!

La chanson sonne très ordinaire, standard selon nous, peut être une autre

I  struggled a bit to stay dialed in on the vocals enough to connect  lyrically. The build and production are there, but I never found my one  moment to land with this one.

**My final thought**

As  you can see the most complain is the drop that isn’t huge, and surprise  surprise, this is what i wanted, i don’t wanna copy niky romero or  other artists, i wanna share my personal vibes, and when i listen a song  i’m looking for a contact with the artist, trying to feel what he felt,  i'm not trying to think about what he was supposed to do, the song is  his world and if he made a different choice there is a reason, and as  listener i try to understand it.

Music  is art, or it should be, i just immagine someone like Picasso in our  era where a curators will write “Sorry but i’m not  expected something  less messy, try to paint like Raffaello”

I can’t post links, but if someone is curious to listen the song send me a DM i will drop you the link

I’m also running a campaign on playlistpush, if this topic will reach some interest i will post my thought on that service too",5.0,0.7,12.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicproduction/comments/hha6qo/my_submithub_experience/,My submithub experience,my submithub experience,"  Hi, i’m here to share my experience on SubmitHub, hoping to be usefull for someone.

The drop is quite fresh and well produced and overall the  track sounds really fresh. Unfortunately, it's a bit too relaxing and  deep for us, sorry ""Fearless""  offers a very accessible and energetic Progressive House sound, the  melodic arrangements are impressive and super uplifting, the track has a  great deep invigorating energy and nice enigmatic ambiance, however,  although it is a quality production, it unfortunately wasn't quite  compelling enough for a blog feature, I'm sorry Thanks  for submitting! I like the very nostalgic and sweet melodies of the  song but the drop is not as energetic as I expected, the kick is a  little too thin and flat and the bass not deep. Hey  there, Cool instrumental and very vibey sound design & chords !  We're not caught by the vocals on this one though. Thanks for sending Good  production enjoyable beat and vocal arrangements unfortunately not  convinced on the melody so let's try your next thanks for submitting Hey,  the intro and the vocals soudns really great of course but actually  dont really like the beat drop. Next time you should work a bit more on  it in my opinion. Hey there, thanks for the submission. Instrumental is fine but vocal is not what we are looking for qualitywise. Sorry! thanks  for submitting Fearless. Been so pumped with teh vocal, sadly the drop  turned out a bit too different than we expected. Hoped for a big  epxlisive one! ( Hey, good track,  good production. I like the instrumental. Unfortunately I am not a fan  of the vocals. They sound too standard to me. Unfortunately they don't  kick me. Therefore, in this case I must decline. Nevertheless I wish you  a lot of success with this song! I'm sure it will find its fans. Thanks  for sending! Nice instrumental. We don't feel the vocals enough. Thanks for submitting it to us This  started of pretty good, really nice pads and great pluck. The vocal was  ok, it didnt sound great at times which didnt really let me enjoy the  song much. The production was quite clean but I didn't really enjoy the  drop much - it was missing alot of elements to keep it interesting.  Great concept though just needs a bit more work - Thanks for sending the  song sounded quite good. This was definitely some high quality  production - The mix was dope and the elements used were good. The  melodies were catchy! Good job! Sadly here, i wasn't hooked by the vocal  topline (lyrics and melodies). Indeed, i felt like it was a bit  repetitive and linear for my personal tastes. I didn't feel like it was  professional enough.. / I know most people will love the song, but it  didn't convince me enough for me to support in my list this time. But  thank you for your submission. Have a good day and stay safe! Even  though the song is not suitable for my playlist, cause I find it too  chill and not that commercial, I want to highlight the originality of  the instrumental Hey, the mix and  master sounds really clean but actually dont really like the break  melody. Next time you should work more on it. Hey  Frankie, thanks for reaching out. The idea is cool and it has  potential, but I'm afraid the mixing quality and the sound desing here  still sounds quite weak and messy, there's no contrast betweent the  different sections of the song.. not really meeting our quality  standards for a feature this time, I'm sorry. Wish you good luck with  your song release! It's a  wonderful summer melody and music production is well done, but we  expected more developed progression..Anyway, keep creating The  energy in the song is nice here. So not bad. But also a bit too beat  driven I would say as I was missing a more melodic production here to  make the song stand out enough for me. So not all the way this time. I appreciate the songwriting, but I wasn't into the final mix of Fearless nor the vocal performance. what we didn't enjoy here is unoriginal melodies, keep on, your voice is amazing not a fan of the drop here but just my taste Thanks  for submitting but I'm going to pass. The song has solid production  that sets a nice tone but vocally I feel the song could be stronger to  my personal ear. Best of luck to you Congrats  on the single. Lovely dance. That ending wasn't what the beginning of  the song was teasing. Was hoping for a huge ending. But that's just us  FT. Nice house, indeed. Keep on kickin' as you do. Sorry couldn't pull  the trigger. Enjoy the accolades. Cool  vibe on the soundscape and vocals. There's definitely some talent  there. For me, I would like to hear a more defining hook that we can  sink our teeth into overall though. This one felt a little too one note  for placement. Super impressive  but sadly did get a bit repetitive for me. Surely might circle back  around to this one though after giving it some time and will reach  out..! Production is really dope  here. Vocals need a little development, sonically fell a little short  for us. Keep it up though, production is dope The intro got me hooked! The drop was however very underwhelming. I'd try adding a lead to it so it can shine! Good  production. The track feels, however, a little on the familiar side and  might benefit from adding fresher sound elements, twists and turns to  really take off and stand out that much more in this genre. Great  tune, loved the vocal as well as the bubbling house vibes on the  baseline. The drop is quite fresh and well produced and overall the  track sounds really fresh. Unfortunately, it's a bit too relaxing and  deep for us, sorry The highs of  this song sound a little bit strange. Would work on that to get a proper  final track because the melody has a really good potential! La chanson sonne très ordinaire, standard selon nous, peut être une autre I  struggled a bit to stay dialed in on the vocals enough to connect  lyrically. The build and production are there, but I never found my one  moment to land with this one. **My final thought** As  you can see the most complain is the drop that isn’t huge, and surprise  surprise, this is what i wanted, i don’t wanna copy niky romero or  other artists, i wanna share my personal vibes, and when i listen a song  i’m looking for a contact with the artist, trying to feel what he felt,  i'm not trying to think about what he was supposed to do, the song is  his world and if he made a different choice there is a reason, and as  listener i try to understand it.

Music is art, or it should be, i just immagine someone like Picasso in our era where a curators will write “Sorry but i’m not  expected something less messy, try to paint like Raffaello” I can’t post links, but if someone is curious to listen the song send me a DM i will drop you the link I’m also running a campaign on playlistpush, if this topic will reach some interest i will post my thought on that service too","hi, i’m here to share my experience on submithub, hoping to be usefull for someone. i’ve used this service for a couple of song, and since it’s a long post, i want to start with the most faq i’ve read on reddit about this.   yes this website is legit, and it’s a great idea, should you use it? it’s all about lucky, i probably won’t use it anymore, not because of the service, that does what it should and the founder it’s always on the chat to help and talk with people, but because curators, at least in my experience, they are not open minded to listen something that try to bring something different on the scene, there is a reason why we are artists and not someone who clean a window, if i wanted to copy somone else i whould chose another job. with the premium credits you will receive the feedback from curators, but are not really helpfull, because someone could say your vocal is awesome but the instrumental suck, and another one the opposite. my last song was declined for sharing by all curators i’ve submitted, i want to copy here all the feedback, because i think it worth reading to have an idea, ofc i wont write who they are, but just the feedback. **feadback (all declined)** great tune, loved the vocal as well as the bubbling house vibes on the baseline. the drop is quite fresh and well produced and overall the track sounds really fresh. unfortunately, it's a bit too relaxing and deep for us, sorry   ""fearless"" offers a very accessible and energetic progressive house sound, the melodic arrangements are impressive and super uplifting, the track has a great deep invigorating energy and nice enigmatic ambiance, however, although it is a quality production, it unfortunately wasn't quite compelling enough for a blog feature, i'm sorry   thanks for submitting! i like the very nostalgic and sweet melodies of the song but the drop is not as energetic as i expected, the kick is a little too thin and flat and the bass not deep.   hey there, cool instrumental and very vibey sound design & chords ! we're not caught by the vocals on this one though. thanks for sending   good production enjoyable beat and vocal arrangements unfortunately not convinced on the melody so let's try your next thanks for submitting   hey, the intro and the vocals soudns really great of course but actually dont really like the beat drop. next time you should work a bit more on it in my opinion.   hey there, thanks for the submission. instrumental is fine but vocal is not what we are looking for qualitywise. sorry!   thanks for submitting fearless. been so pumped with teh vocal, sadly the drop turned out a bit too different than we expected. hoped for a big epxlisive one! (   hey, good track, good production. i like the instrumental. unfortunately i am not a fan of the vocals. they sound too standard to me. unfortunately they don't kick me. therefore, in this case i must decline. nevertheless i wish you a lot of success with this song! i'm sure it will find its fans. thanks for sending!   nice instrumental. we don't feel the vocals enough. thanks for submitting it to us   this started of pretty good, really nice pads and great pluck. the vocal was ok, it didnt sound great at times which didnt really let me enjoy the song much. the production was quite clean but i didn't really enjoy the drop much - it was missing alot of elements to keep it interesting. great concept though just needs a bit more work - thanks for sending   the song sounded quite good. this was definitely some high quality production - the mix was dope and the elements used were good. the melodies were catchy! good job! sadly here, i wasn't hooked by the vocal topline (lyrics and melodies). indeed, i felt like it was a bit repetitive and linear for my personal tastes. i didn't feel like it was professional enough.. / i know most people will love the song, but it didn't convince me enough for me to support in my list this time. but thank you for your submission. have a good day and stay safe!   even though the song is not suitable for my playlist, cause i find it too chill and not that commercial, i want to highlight the originality of the instrumental   hey, the mix and master sounds really clean but actually dont really like the break melody. next time you should work more on it.   hey frankie, thanks for reaching out. the idea is cool and it has potential, but i'm afraid the mixing quality and the sound desing here still sounds quite weak and messy, there's no contrast betweent the different sections of the song.. not really meeting our quality standards for a feature this time, i'm sorry. wish you good luck with your song release!   it's a wonderful summer melody and music production is well done, but we expected more developed progression..anyway, keep creating   the energy in the song is nice here. so not bad. but also a bit too beat driven i would say as i was missing a more melodic production here to make the song stand out enough for me. so not all the way this time.   i appreciate the songwriting, but i wasn't into the final mix of fearless nor the vocal performance.   what we didn't enjoy here is unoriginal melodies, keep on, your voice is amazing   not a fan of the drop here but just my taste   thanks for submitting but i'm going to pass. the song has solid production that sets a nice tone but vocally i feel the song could be stronger to my personal ear. best of luck to you   congrats on the single. lovely dance. that ending wasn't what the beginning of the song was teasing. was hoping for a huge ending. but that's just us ft. nice house, indeed. keep on kickin' as you do. sorry couldn't pull the trigger. enjoy the accolades.   cool vibe on the soundscape and vocals. there's definitely some talent there. for me, i would like to hear a more defining hook that we can sink our teeth into overall though. this one felt a little too one note for placement.   super impressive but sadly did get a bit repetitive for me. surely might circle back around to this one though after giving it some time and will reach out..!   production is really dope here. vocals need a little development, sonically fell a little short for us. keep it up though, production is dope   the intro got me hooked! the drop was however very underwhelming. i'd try adding a lead to it so it can shine!   good production. the track feels, however, a little on the familiar side and might benefit from adding fresher sound elements, twists and turns to really take off and stand out that much more in this genre.   great tune, loved the vocal as well as the bubbling house vibes on the baseline. the drop is quite fresh and well produced and overall the track sounds really fresh. unfortunately, it's a bit too relaxing and deep for us, sorry   the highs of this song sound a little bit strange. would work on that to get a proper final track because the melody has a really good potential!

The current popular submission services can also take a relatively long time to have all curators respond.

gmvoxd,1589917359.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,[deleted],"My experiences with paid promotion so far (submithub, playlistpush, facebook)","**If you're lazy, just read the TL:DR section.** So I recently pushed a track hard for the first time, spending quite a bit of money on it. Thought I'd share my experience so far with these popular platforms. Please note these are my opinions and not facts; platforms are also changing over time, for example both submithub &amp; playlistpush has changed quite a bit since they started (both of them seem to be getting better). This is of May 2020.

.

**Facebook ads (with Spotify link):**

Very difficult to get any streams this way. Facebook is good if you want to reach out with information (ie, ""I'm playing live this summer!"") but not for getting streams. Also, you MUST be very specific about your target audience. The FB algorithms seemingly show your ad primarily to people who usually randomly like &amp; click stuff. This is probably not what you want... a 30 sec preview clip with Spotify API will also not count as a stream. I tried several campains over a few weeks to different countries &amp; target audiences, and my conclusion is that it's a tricky platform to use to get Spotify streams specifically.

.

**TL:DR: Facebook ads are good for specific things (reaching out with information), but very expensive if you count it per stream with a Spotify link. I've had better results with YouTube videos in the past though; unfortunately a shiny Spotify preview 30 sec clip will not count as a stream.**

.

**Submithub:**

While the authors claim to be taking playlist curators seriously and having quality control, this is simply not  true. I've seen banned Spotify playlists that, even a week later, still remained on Submithub &amp; people sending +20 daily premium submissions. (Ie, someone makes money to listen to music and their fake bot playlist doesn't even exist anymore...) If you look at these curators including ""really good bloggers"" as they call them, some have an FB account with +100k likes but almost no likes or interaction on posts. I'd say too many of curators on submithub are shady in the sense that it's not useful to you as an artist to get reposted to bot playlist &amp; some random ""big"" influencer that has a bunch of fake likes/streams or they brag with a +1 million subs youtube channel, but there's only famous artists on there (you won't get reposted there). Or a big Spotify playlist but you'll never end up on the good ones, just their ""dumpster"" playlist for reposts from Submithub so their stats will look good &amp; they can keep making money by ""listening"" to people's music.

.

**TL:DR:** **While the above sounded very negative, Submithub is decent if you do your research. Just be aware that it takes a LOT of time and effort to find out the good curators (don't be fooled by shiny stats; you have to dig deep). After you use the service, I recommend creating a list of curators were your sort out good ones and also a blacklist (yes, a blacklist). You do NOT want to end up on fake playlists; make sure to post to curators with a high premium following on Spotify.**

.

**Playlist Push:**

I was sceptical because of the combo of lack of settings when you submit a song &amp; the price you pay, everything is pretty much automated. What happens now? I like to have more control. Well, I was  pleased to find that all curators you get posted to write (often quite extensive) reviews of your song that clearly show they've listened to the song (regardless if they accept/reject). I also saw a curator that got banned during my campaign because he didn't live up to the quality standards, so that was a nice touch, they seemingly work actively to maintain serious curators. I got several reposts from here to big playlists with +100k followers and most of them seem to be the real deal (even though you'll likely end up far down in the playlists themselves, just the big artists at the top; altough I did end up on 9th place on a very big playlist among world-famous artists, woohoo!)

.

**TL:DR: Overall, I'm impressed with the Playlist Push experience and this will likely be my go-to promotion service for upcoming songs. Hopefully they will introduce more filters in the future, but you will get REAL curators and playlists to look at your song; they work activly to sort out the BS. (And no, I don't work for them).**

SubmitHub is harder to get approved.

PlaylistPush you will get something for sure.

It all depends on the songs, if the song is good it will have a good reaction.

(I have 25 years of producing experience, plus collaborated with an audio engineer, so hopefully my songs are 'on a level')

What you gain : Streams , followers and saves/add to library... What's the best of these, it's definitively 'saves' ... I got a huge percent of plays from 'listener's own playlist and library' which is coming from the saves. Second best is followers, more followers you have easier to get into the algorithms. Plus release radar is a huge thing.I get followers from playlists but also ask people I know to follow me , one by one.

Biggest rejection reason is : Wrong genre or 'not our audience' , so be extra careful not to tag genres that aren't relevant.

My campaigns haven't ended so I might get even more adds.

I paid around 300 + 280 + 14 = 594$.

If I would spend this on instagram, facebook or youtube ads, I would gain ZERO and the money would be gone.

TLDR: It works, you'll get added to legit playlists with real people, the downside is it's expensive.

I am only speaking from my own experience. I have read a lot of different views and cases from different people on this site with both good and bad experiences. This is just one more to add to those for reference, in hopes that it will help you guys make a more informed decision whether to use these services and how to approach using them.

&amp;#x200B;

# SubmitHub

**How it works**

You buy premium credits which cost roughly $1 per credit. There are different packages but basically the more you buy the more discount you get. You can then use these credits to submit your song to blogs/playlist curators/labels to listen and they will decide whether to share it or not. Typically it will cost 1 credit per submission, with a few blogs/curators that charge up to 2 or 3 credits because they are of higher quality (this can mean a variety of different things but typically it's because their reach/audience is higher or they provide better feedback etc). Your credit is spent whether or not they share the song, but they are required to give you feedback if your song is rejected. There is a lot of info on the site about the bloggers you can submit to, including but not limited to their approval rate, their audience count and sources, the songs that they recently shared, etc. It should be noted that there is a free credit system where you receive 2 credits per day (can not be accumulated) I believe. Some blogs take free credits but IMO any blog worth submitting to usually would only take premium credits.

**My experience**

When I first discovered SubmitHub I was ecstatic that this platform existed to directly connect artists with curators/bloggers. I explored the site and everything seemed straight forward enough. So I purchased a bunch of credits, filtered the blogs based on the genre of my newly released track and started submitting away. I did this for a couple days and the results started coming in. I think I submitted to over 100 curators (combination of premium and free credits but mostly premium) and of the ones that responded not one wanted to share my song. That's right - 100 rejections.

At this point I was quite discouraged to say the least and was tempted to give up. Perhaps my music wasn't good enough or my genre of music just wasn't a big hit on the site. Ultimately though I decided to take this as a learning experience rather than surrendering. I did some more research, reading some SubmitHub success stories and tips (the site has its own resource link for tips). I took in all the feedback with an accepting mentality and aimed to improve my own craft based on the criticism. I realized that the average approval rate of the site is quite low at 11%. My own 0% approval was even lower,  but knowing that it's a tough field to begin with was actually encouraging to me, since there is more of a chance it's not my music that completely sucks. Most importantly, I learned that I didn't do enough research on the curators I submitted to.

As mentioned above, there is a lot of info about the curators that I completely overlooked. I only filtered out the genres and started submitting. Here's the thing about genres - there is a ton on the site for you to choose from and I find that a lot of times they are interpretive. For example ""Commercial"" music can mean one thing to someone and something else to another. What I started to do was go through the list of curators one by one. I listened to their recently shared tracks. I listened to more songs on their actual playlists. I also took into account their approval rate. There are curators that actually approve 100% of their submissions, which are ones you might want to avoid because the quality of their lists/listeners may be questionable. And then there are curators that have below 1% approval rate, reflecting how tough their standards are. I filtered the curators down to the ones with around 15% - 30% approval rate because I wanted my song submitted to quality lists but at the same time have a fighting chance. The priority though is making sure my song is a good fit with that of the curator's list. After many hours of research, my shortlist of curators was at around 20. And so I launched a submission campaign with this more fine tuned list. After a couple days all my results came in. Of the 20 submissions, 15 responded, and 8 approved my track to be shared/added on their playlist. 5 credits refunded to me. I was stoked. That's over 50% that approved my track, which is actually higher than the overall average and miles ahead of my original campaign. Now the range of quality of the shares was quite broad. Most were quite good, adding my song to lists with hundreds of listeners and some cases thousands. There was a curator though that added my song to a playlist with 2 listeners. Whatever. Coming from 100 rejections I took every approval/share as a big win. Also kept in mind that any playlist add is good for the Spotify algorithm and helps with chances of getting your song added to an editorial playlist which in my mind is the ultimate goal.

&amp;#x200B;

# PlaylistPush

**How it Works**

You launch a campaign by first submitting your already released Spotify track to see if it qualifies. I think it takes at most one day for them to get back to you. Once they approve your track you can get started (I imagine it is very rare that they will reject your track for a campaign). You start by typing in some similar artists to yourself and some genres will be assigned to your song. You can modify these genres (subtracting what they assigned or adding some that they missed). Once you are happy with classifying your song into the genres, the next step is selecting the budget for your song. 3 options are offered: ""Precise"", ""Accurate"", ""Broad"". Here is a screenshot of what it looks like.

&amp;#x200B;

[PlaylistPush campaign packages](https://preview.redd.it/pq3jx9bae3m31.jpg?width=795&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=665da86cf41af5e8a93e2289eab997ce1c70c474)

The pricing is dependent on the genre of your song. Some genres are more expensive than others depending on how many curators they have. You're looking at this right - it's quite pricey. From the PlaylistPush site itself, ""The average campaign cost is around $450. However, pricing can range from as low as $250 to $1,000+ depending on which genres and matching you select."" After all is done and finalized you just wait 2 weeks for all your results to come in.

**My Experience**

You will see in the image that there is a small button at the bottom ""More Price Options."" From there I was able to select the cheapest campaign possible at $202.50 (everyone's budget is different, but I just don't have several hundred dollars to easily spare). For that price my song was submitted to 19 playlists. After I finalized the campaign there was nothing else to do but wait for the results. You have no control over which curators your song goes to and there is no info about the curators and their playlists. You just have to trust the site's algorithm to send your song the right curators in terms of genre matching. The whole process has a much more ""automated"" feel. If you do the math, that's approximately $10.65 per submission which is 10 times more expensive than SubmitHub. Now if you go with the more expensive packages, the price per submission does goes down. But nevertheless still not very cheap to say the least. The important question is if it's worth it. These were my results: 10 curators added my song while 9 rejected it. All came back with some brief feedback as that's what's required. All the playlist adds were on decent lists with at least several hundred followers. Results will definitely vary from song to song but 10 out of 19 was something I was quite happy with.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion

One thing I want to clarify is that this isn't a ""versus"" type comparison review where I choose a winner among the two. I think both platforms have its merits. If you only look at my results though, you will see that I was able to spend $15 on SubmitHub to get 8 playlist adds (not counting the first $100 I spent not knowing how to properly utilize the site), and on PlaylistPush I spent $202.50 for 10 playlist adds. So does SubmitHub have way more value? Not necessarily. Keep in mind that along with the $15, I spent hours and hours researching curators to come up with my shortlist to submit to. One hour can be worth a lot depending on who you talk to. Moreover, every hour doing something else (like researching curators) is one less hour for you to work on creating music. For PlaylistPush I just filled out a digital form and hit ""go"". So even though you can say PlaylistPush is way more pricey, I believe the extra premium is for the convenience, time saved, and more of a guarantee on the playlist quality. I would say that PlaylistPush has a higher bar for their pool of curators and playlists in terms of number of followers and active listeners. SubmitHub on the other hand is all over the place with that. You might get scenarios where some curators are actually primarily music bloggers that happen to have a playlist with a few followers. To be fair though SubmitHub is very transparent with that and provides sufficient data for you to make an informed decision. Honestly, I think that for all the data and info you can obtain from SubmitHub, $1 per submission is dirt cheap. It is up to you to assess all that data though.

So if you have a limited budget and lots of time and energy to spare, I'd say give SubmitHub a shot. If you have a higher marketing budget and don't have much free time, PlaylistPush can be a good tool for you. How long your track stays on the approved playlists is entirely up to the curator but I believe the minimum is one week. How rewarding these campaigns are will vary case by case. You will definitely see a spike in monthly listeners if you get a few playlist adds but when your song eventually gets taken down it's hard to say if you can maintain that momentum. During this time of exposure gaining new followers and track saves will be key stats to look out for IMO. For me it worked out quite well as my track got saved a few hundred times and that's a lot for me.

&amp;#x200B;

# Why they are not a scam

I've seen the words ""scam"" and ""payola"" thrown around a lot. Usually from people who have had a bad experience with the sites or from people who don't really know the basic concept of the platforms. Based on the definition of payola, the fact that there are so many rejections among both sites is already an indication they are not that. As for the label ""scam"", this is mostly from people who used the sites and didn't get the results they wanted (ie. got rejected a lot). If you read through the documentation and FAQs on the sites, they are very upfront with what to expect if you use the platform. SubmitHub clearly states that the average approval rate is quite low (at 11%). Some people say the feedback quality is poor and some say they feel generic. Some say that they got good things said about their song but was rejected so that makes no sense. I'll be honest that I didn't care too much about that part because I was mainly focused on getting playlist shares. Here's the thing. These curators probably listen to hundreds or thousands of songs in a month. There's only so many ways to reject you or tell you that your song is not a good fit for their list and not necessarily because they don't like it. They have probably dealt with their fair share of artists with fragile egos and have learnt to be polite (maybe overly so) when giving you bad news. Hey I get it. I'm an artist too and it doesn't feel great when others tell you that your music is not good enough. It's very easy to fall into the trap of being defensive and projecting the blame on everything else but your own music. For me a scam is when there is an intent to cheat you somehow. When these sites are upfront and clear what you are walking into, I think everything is fair game.

&amp;#x200B;

That's all. I see that this has become quite a long post. I hope it helps those of you looking for more case studies of these platforms.

SubmitHub on the other hand is all over the place with that. You might get scenarios where some curators are actually primarily music bloggers that happen to have a playlist with a few followers. To be fair though SubmitHub is very transparent with that and provides sufficient data for you to make an informed decision. Honestly, I think that for all the data and info you can obtain from SubmitHub, $1 per submission is dirt cheap. It is up to you to assess all that data though. So if you have a limited budget and lots of time and energy to spare, I'd say give SubmitHub a shot. If you have a higher marketing budget and don't have much free time, PlaylistPush can be a good tool for you. How long your track stays on the approved playlists is entirely up to the curator but I believe the minimum is one week. How rewarding these campaigns are will vary case by case. You will definitely see a spike in monthly listeners if you get a few playlist adds but when your song eventually gets taken down it's hard to say if you can maintain that momentum. During this time of exposure gaining new followers and track saves will be key stats to look out for IMO. For me it worked out quite well as my track got saved a few hundred times and that's a lot for me. &x200B;  Why they are not a scam I've seen the words ""scam"" and ""payola"" thrown around a lot. Usually from people who have had a bad experience with the sites or from people who don't really know the basic concept of the platforms. Based on the definition of payola, the fact that there are so many rejections among both sites is already an indication they are not that. As for the label ""scam"", this is mostly from people who used the sites and didn't get the results they wanted (ie. got rejected a lot). If you read through the documentation and FAQs on the sites, they are very upfront with what to expect if you use the platform. SubmitHub clearly states that the average approval rate is quite low (at 11%). Some people say the feedback quality is poor and some say they feel generic. Some say that they got good things said about their song but was rejected so that makes no sense. I'll be honest that I didn't care too much about that part because I was mainly focused on getting playlist shares. Here's the thing. These curators probably listen to hundreds or thousands of songs in a month. There's only so many ways to reject you or tell you that your song is not a good fit for their list and not necessarily because they don't like it. They have probably dealt with their fair share of artists with fragile egos and have learnt to be polite (maybe overly so) when giving you bad news. Hey I get it. I'm an artist too and it doesn't feel great when others tell you that your music is not good enough. It's very easy to fall into the trap of being defensive and projecting the blame on everything else but your own music. For me a scam is when there is an intent to cheat you somehow. When these sites are upfront and clear what you are walking into, I think everything is fair game. &x200B; That's all. I see that this has become quite a long post. I hope it helps those of you looking for more case studies of these platforms.

# SubmitHub

**How it works**

You buy premium credits which cost roughly $1 per credit. There are different packages but basically the more you buy the more discount you get. You can then use these credits to submit your song to blogs/playlist curators/labels to listen and they will decide whether to share it or not. Typically it will cost 1 credit per submission, with a few blogs/curators that charge up to 2 or 3 credits because they are of higher quality (this can mean a variety of different things but typically it's because their reach/audience is higher or they provide better feedback etc). Your credit is spent whether or not they share the song, but they are required to give you feedback if your song is rejected. There is a lot of info on the site about the bloggers you can submit to, including but not limited to their approval rate, their audience count and sources, the songs that they recently shared, etc. It should be noted that there is a free credit system where you receive 2 credits per day (can not be accumulated) I believe. Some blogs take free credits but IMO any blog worth submitting to usually would only take premium credits.

**My experience**

When I first discovered SubmitHub I was ecstatic that this platform existed to directly connect artists with curators/bloggers. I explored the site and everything seemed straight forward enough. So I purchased a bunch of credits, filtered the blogs based on the genre of my newly released track and started submitting away. I did this for a couple days and the results started coming in. I think I submitted to over 100 curators (combination of premium and free credits but mostly premium) and of the ones that responded not one wanted to share my song. That's right - 100 rejections.

At this point I was quite discouraged to say the least and was tempted to give up. Perhaps my music wasn't good enough or my genre of music just wasn't a big hit on the site. Ultimately though I decided to take this as a learning experience rather than surrendering. I did some more research, reading some SubmitHub success stories and tips (the site has its own resource link for tips). I took in all the feedback with an accepting mentality and aimed to improve my own craft based on the criticism. I realized that the average approval rate of the site is quite low at 11%. My own 0% approval was even lower,  but knowing that it's a tough field to begin with was actually encouraging to me, since there is more of a chance it's not my music that completely sucks. Most importantly, I learned that I didn't do enough research on the curators I submitted to.

As mentioned above, there is a lot of info about the curators that I completely overlooked. I only filtered out the genres and started submitting. Here's the thing about genres - there is a ton on the site for you to choose from and I find that a lot of times they are interpretive. For example ""Commercial"" music can mean one thing to someone and something else to another. What I started to do was go through the list of curators one by one. I listened to their recently shared tracks. I listened to more songs on their actual playlists. I also took into account their approval rate. There are curators that actually approve 100% of their submissions, which are ones you might want to avoid because the quality of their lists/listeners may be questionable. And then there are curators that have below 1% approval rate, reflecting how tough their standards are. I filtered the curators down to the ones with around 15% - 30% approval rate because I wanted my song submitted to quality lists but at the same time have a fighting chance. The priority though is making sure my song is a good fit with that of the curator's list. After many hours of research, my shortlist of curators was at around 20. And so I launched a submission campaign with this more fine tuned list. After a couple days all my results came in. Of the 20 submissions, 15 responded, and 8 approved my track to be shared/added on their playlist. 5 credits refunded to me. I was stoked. That's over 50% that approved my track, which is actually higher than the overall average and miles ahead of my original campaign. Now the range of quality of the shares was quite broad. Most were quite good, adding my song to lists with hundreds of listeners and some cases thousands. There was a curator though that added my song to a playlist with 2 listeners. Whatever. Coming from 100 rejections I took every approval/share as a big win. Also kept in mind that any playlist add is good for the Spotify algorithm and helps with chances of getting your song added to an editorial playlist which in my mind is the ultimate goal.

# PlaylistPush

**How it Works**

You launch a campaign by first submitting your already released Spotify track to see if it qualifies. I think it takes at most one day for them to get back to you. Once they approve your track you can get started (I imagine it is very rare that they will reject your track for a campaign). You start by typing in some similar artists to yourself and some genres will be assigned to your song. You can modify these genres (subtracting what they assigned or adding some that they missed). Once you are happy with classifying your song into the genres, the next step is selecting the budget for your song. 3 options are offered: ""Precise"", ""Accurate"", ""Broad"". Here is a screenshot of what it looks like.

&amp;#x200B;

[PlaylistPush campaign packages](https://preview.redd.it/06e37j2bc3m31.jpg?width=795&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5c4cd6eebb8cf8e05d71e2a1f3ba8a0898e4ebd)

The pricing is dependent on the genre of your song. Some genres are more expensive than others depending on how many curators they have. You're looking at this right - it's quite pricey. From the PlaylistPush site itself, ""The average campaign cost is around $450. However, pricing can range from as low as $250 to $1,000+ depending on which genres and matching you select."" After all is done and finalized you just wait 2 weeks for all your results to come in.

**My Experience**

You will see in the image that there is a small button at the bottom ""More Price Options."" From there I was able to select the cheapest campaign possible at $202.50 (everyone's budget is different, but I just don't have several hundred dollars to easily spare). For that price my song was submitted to 19 playlists. After I finalized the campaign there was nothing else to do but wait for the results. You have no control over which curators your song goes to and there is no info about the curators and their playlists. You just have to trust the site's algorithm to send your song the right curators in terms of genre matching. The whole process has a much more ""automated"" feel. If you do the math, that's approximately $10.65 per submission which is 10 times more expensive than SubmitHub. Now if you go with the more expensive packages, the price per submission does goes down. But nevertheless still not very cheap to say the least. The important question is if it's worth it. These were my results: 10 curators added my song while 9 rejected it. All came back with some brief feedback as that's what's required. All the playlist adds were on decent lists with at least several hundred followers. Results will definitely vary from song to song but 10 out of 19 was something I was quite happy with.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion

One thing I want to clarify is that this isn't a ""versus"" type comparison review where I choose a winner among the two. I think both platforms have its merits. If you only look at my results though, you will see that I was able to spend $15 on SubmitHub to get 8 playlist adds (not counting the first $100 I spent not knowing how to properly utilize the site), and on PlaylistPush I spent $202.50 for 10 playlist adds. So does SubmitHub have way more value? Not necessarily. Keep in mind that along with the $15, I spent hours and hours researching curators to come up with my shortlist to submit to. One hour can be worth a lot depending on who you talk to. Moreover, every hour doing something else (like researching curators) is one less hour for you to work on creating music. For PlaylistPush I just filled out a digital form and hit ""go"". So even though you can say PlaylistPush is way more pricey, I believe the extra premium is for the convenience, time saved, and more of a guarantee on the playlist quality. I would say that PlaylistPush has a higher bar for their pool of curators and playlists in terms of number of followers and active listeners. SubmitHub on the other hand is all over the place with that. You might get scenarios where some curators are actually primarily music bloggers that happen to have a playlist with a few followers. To be fair though SubmitHub is very transparent with that and provides sufficient data for you to make an informed decision. Honestly, I think that for all the data and info you can obtain from SubmitHub, $1 per submission is dirt cheap. It is up to you to assess all that data though.

So if you have a limited budget and lots of time and energy to spare, I'd say give SubmitHub a shot. If you have a higher marketing budget and don't have much free time, PlaylistPush can be a good tool for you. How long your track stays on the approved playlists is entirely up to the curator but I believe the minimum is one week. How rewarding these campaigns are will vary case by case. You will definitely see a spike in monthly listeners if you get a few playlist adds but when your song eventually gets taken down it's hard to say if you can maintain that momentum. During this time of exposure gaining new followers and track saves will be key stats to look out for IMO. For me it worked out quite well as my track got saved a few hundred times and that's a lot for me.

# Why they are not a scam

I've seen the words ""scam"" and ""payola"" thrown around a lot. Usually from people who have had a bad experience with the sites or from people who don't really know the basic concept of the platforms. Based on the definition of payola, the fact that there are so many rejections among both sites is already an indication they are not that. As for the label ""scam"", this is mostly from people who used the sites and didn't get the results they wanted (ie. got rejected a lot). If you read through the documentation and FAQs on the sites, they are very upfront with what to expect if you use the platform. SubmitHub clearly states that the average approval rate is quite low (at 11%). Some people say the feedback quality is poor and some say they feel generic. Some say that they got good things said about their song but was rejected so that makes no sense. I'll be honest that I didn't care too much about that part because I was mainly focused on getting playlist shares. Here's the thing. These curators probably listen to hundreds or thousands of songs in a month. There's only so many ways to reject you or tell you that your song is not a good fit for their list and not necessarily because they don't like it. They have probably dealt with their fair share of artists with fragile egos and have learnt to be polite (maybe overly so) when giving you bad news. Hey I get it. I'm an artist too and it doesn't feel great when others tell you that your music is not good enough. It's very easy to fall into the trap of being defensive and projecting the blame on everything else but your own music. For me a scam is when there is an intent to cheat you somehow. When these sites are upfront and clear what you are walking into, I think everything is fair game.

&amp;#x200B;

That's all. I see that this has become quite a long post. I hope it helps those of you looking for more case studies of these platforms.

Now if you go with the more expensive packages, the price per submission does goes down. But nevertheless still not very cheap to say the least. The important question is if it's worth it. These were my results 10 curators added my song while 9 rejected it. All came back with some brief feedback as that's what's required. All the playlist adds were on decent lists with at least several hundred followers. Results will definitely vary from song to song but 10 out of 19 was something I was quite happy with. &x200B;  Conclusion One thing I want to clarify is that this isn't a ""versus"" type comparison review where I choose a winner among the two. I think both platforms have its merits. If you only look at my results though, you will see that I was able to spend $15 on SubmitHub to get 8 playlist adds (not counting the first $100 I spent not knowing how to properly utilize the site), and on PlaylistPush I spent $202.50 for 10 playlist adds. So does SubmitHub have way more value? Not necessarily. Keep in mind that along with the $15, I spent hours and hours researching curators to come up with my shortlist to submit to. One hour can be worth a lot depending on who you talk to. Moreover, every hour doing something else (like researching curators) is one less hour for you to work on creating music. For PlaylistPush I just filled out a digital form and hit ""go"". So even though you can say PlaylistPush is way more pricey, I believe the extra premium is for the convenience, time saved, and more of a guarantee on the playlist quality. I would say that PlaylistPush has a higher bar for their pool of curators and playlists in terms of number of followers and active listeners. SubmitHub on the other hand is all over the place with that. You might get scenarios where some curators are actually primarily music bloggers that happen to have a playlist with a few followers. To be fair though SubmitHub is very transparent with that and provides sufficient data for you to make an informed decision. Honestly, I think that for all the data and info you can obtain from SubmitHub, $1 per submission is dirt cheap. It is up to you to assess all that data though. So if you have a limited budget and lots of time and energy to spare, I'd say give SubmitHub a shot. If you have a higher marketing budget and don't have much free time, PlaylistPush can be a good tool for you. How long your track stays on the approved playlists is entirely up to the curator but I believe the minimum is one week. How rewarding these campaigns are will vary case by case. You will definitely see a spike in monthly listeners if you get a few playlist adds but when your song eventually gets taken down it's hard to say if you can maintain that momentum. During this time of exposure gaining new followers and track saves will be key stats to look out for IMO. For me it worked out quite well as my track got saved a few hundred times and that's a lot for me. &x200B;  Why they are not a scam I've seen the words ""scam"" and ""payola"" thrown around a lot. Usually from people who have had a bad experience with the sites or from people who don't really know the basic concept of the platforms. Based on the definition of payola, the fact that there are so many rejections among both sites is already an indication they are not that. As for the label ""scam"", this is mostly from people who used the sites and didn't get the results they wanted (ie. got rejected a lot). If you read through the documentation and FAQs on the sites, they are very upfront with what to expect if you use the platform. SubmitHub clearly states that the average approval rate is quite low (at 11%). Some people say the feedback quality is poor and some say they feel generic. Some say that they got good things said about their song but was rejected so that makes no sense. I'll be honest that I didn't care too much about that part because I was mainly focused on getting playlist shares. Here's the thing. These curators probably listen to hundreds or thousands of songs in a month. There's only so many ways to reject you or tell you that your song is not a good fit for their list and not necessarily because they don't like it. They have probably dealt with their fair share of artists with fragile egos and have learnt to be polite (maybe overly so) when giving you bad news. Hey I get it. I'm an artist too and it doesn't feel great when others tell you that your music is not good enough. It's very easy to fall into the trap of being defensive and projecting the blame on everything else but your own music. For me a scam is when there is an intent to cheat you somehow. When these sites are upfront and clear what you are walking into, I think everything is fair game. &x200B; That's all. I see that this has become quite a long post. I hope it helps those of you looking for more case studies of these platforms.

section where i give my opinion. i am only speaking from my own experience. i have read a lot of different views and cases from different people on this site with both good and bad experiences. this is just one more to add to those for reference, in hopes that it will help you guys make a more informed decision whether to use these services and how to approach using them. i am offering my opinion which may differ from others based on their experiences. it should also be noted that i only aimed to get my songs on playlists and didn't care much for blog features or feedback.  submithub **how it works** you buy premium credits which cost roughly $1 per credit. there are different packages but basically the more you buy the more discount you get. you can then use these credits to submit your song to blogs/playlist curators/labels to listen and they will decide whether to share it or not. typically it will cost 1 credit per submission, with a few blogs/curators that charge up to 2 or 3 credits because they are of higher quality (this can mean a variety of different things but typically it's because their reach/audience is higher or they provide better feedback etc). your credit is spent whether or not they share the song, but they are required to give you feedback if your song is rejected. there is a lot of info on the site about the bloggers you can submit to, including but not limited to their approval rate, their audience count and sources, the songs that they recently shared, etc. it should be noted that there is a free credit system where you receive 2 credits per day (can not be accumulated) i believe. some blogs take free credits but imo any blog worth submitting to usually would only take premium credits. **my experience** when i first discovered submithub i was ecstatic that this platform existed to directly connect artists with curators/bloggers. i explored the site and everything seemed straight forward enough. so i purchased a bunch of credits, filtered the blogs based on the genre of my newly released track and started submitting away. i did this for a couple days and the results started coming in. i think i submitted to over 100 curators (combination of premium and free credits but mostly premium) and of the ones that responded not one wanted to share my song. that's right - 100 rejections. at this point i was quite discouraged to say the least and was tempted to give up. perhaps my music wasn't good enough or my genre of music just wasn't a big hit on the site. ultimately though i decided to take this as a learning experience rather than surrendering. i did some more research, reading some submithub success stories and tips (the site has its own resource link for tips). i took in all the feedback with an accepting mentality and aimed to improve my own craft based on the criticism. i realized that the average approval rate of the site is quite low at 11%. my own 0% approval was even lower,  but knowing that it's a tough field to begin with was actually encouraging to me, since there is more of a chance it's not my music that completely sucks. most importantly, i learned that i didn't do enough research on the curators i submitted to. as mentioned above, there is a lot of info about the curators that i completely overlooked. i only filtered out the genres and started submitting. here's the thing about genres - there is a ton on the site for you to choose from and i find that a lot of times they are interpretive. for example ""commercial"" music can mean one thing to someone and something else to another. what i started to do was go through the list of curators one by one. i listened to their recently shared tracks. i listened to more songs on their actual playlists. i also took into account their approval rate. there are curators that actually approve 100% of their submissions, which are ones you might want to avoid because the quality of their lists/listeners may be questionable. and then there are curators that have below 1% approval rate, reflecting how tough their standards are. i filtered the curators down to the ones with around 15% - 30% approval rate because i wanted my song submitted to quality lists but at the same time have a fighting chance. the priority though is making sure my song is a good fit with that of the curator's list. after many hours of research, my shortlist of curators was at around 20. and so i launched a submission campaign with this more fine tuned list. after a couple days all my results came in. of the 20 submissions, 15 responded, and 8 approved my track to be shared/added on their playlist. 5 credits refunded to me. i was stoked. that's over 50% that approved my track, which is actually higher than the overall average and miles ahead of my original campaign. now the range of quality of the shares was quite broad. most were quite good, adding my song to lists with hundreds of listeners and some cases thousands. there was a curator though that added my song to a playlist with 2 listeners. whatever. coming from 100 rejections i took every approval/share as a big win. also kept in mind that any playlist add is good for the spotify algorithm and helps with chances of getting your song added to an editorial playlist which in my mind is the ultimate goal. &x200b;  playlistpush **how it works** you launch a campaign by first submitting your already released spotify track to see if it qualifies. i think it takes at most one day for them to get back to you. once they approve your track you can get started (i imagine it is very rare that they will reject your track for a campaign). you start by typing in some similar artists to yourself and some genres will be assigned to your song. you can modify these genres (subtracting what they assigned or adding some that they missed). once you are happy with classifying your song into the genres, the next step is selecting the budget for your song. 3 options are offered ""precise"", ""accurate"", ""broad"". here is a screenshot of what it looks like. &x200b; playlistpush campaign packages. for that price my song was submitted to 19 playlists. after i finalized the campaign there was nothing else to do but wait for the results. you have no control over which curators your song goes to and there is no info about the curators and their playlists. you just have to trust the site's algorithm to send your song the right curators in terms of genre matching. the whole process has a much more ""automated"" feel. if you do the math, that's approximately $10.65 per submission which is 10 times more expensive than submithub. now if you go with the more expensive packages, the price per submission does goes down. but nevertheless still not very cheap to

1agfdlk,1706805905.0,AskTunecore,Impossible-Debate936,Streaming fraud penalty,"

My band had our music taken down from spotify and apple music. We received an email from our distributor Tunecore that spotify had detected fraudulent streams on our ep. Even after requesting the data and proof they will not email us back. 

Early on when we had our first release we used a service called playlist push. New to the scene we didn't realize that these curators could use bots to gain a bigger following on their playlist. We believe this is how we ended up with fake streams. 

We don't really care about the stream numbers we only had 100k in 9 months time. We honestly just want to be able to put the music back out for our fans, seeing as how spotify and apple are where most people stream music. 

Tunecores email stated that they will not redistribute our ep to the market and that in any attempt to do so we will be blocked. Yet on their support page it says that the only way to get the music back on is to make a new release. 

So the question remains. If we choose a different distributor like distrokid and take the same tracks and same names of the tracks and try to send them back onto the market is that breaking the rules? Will we be punished again. I understand that every package comes with a upc number and every individual track has an irsc number attached to it. If we re release it will we fall right back into these same numbers and be flagged or will it generate new codes that won't be associated with the previous upc number. 

We had no intentions of cheating to get streams. We don't want to be associated with any playlist that uses bots. We just want to get back out there even if it means starting over. I just don't think it's fair that we can't redistribute the same songs.",1.0,1.0,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTunecore/comments/1agfdlk/streaming_fraud_penalty/,Streaming fraud penalty,streaming fraud penalty," My band had our music taken down from spotify and apple music.

I've been scouring this sub, YouTube, and internet archives for advice on first releases, first promotions, etc., and there's a ton of information and guides (many of them being here!). As someone who's planning and currently producing a first release in a few months, hoping to start off at some open mics soon thereafter, do some playlist pushes, and work the social media ads, I'd love to hear your thoughts on what someone who's just starting out needs to be prepared for in the marketing and promotional realm in 2024 — good or bad, scary or funny, all of it.

* What are you seeing in the industry landscape right now for first releases?
* Is it worth it to push regular Instagram and TikTok content even before you have a single released?
* How can new artists be prepared for the 2024 market?
* Is it necessary to be a content creator to get your music out there?
* What do YOU wish you knew when you were just starting out?

TikTok music videos often go viral for various reasons; from catchy tunes to lyrics that resonate with their audiences.

""Pieces,"" by pianist Danilo Stankovic is currently making waves for its ability to evoke emotion. Videos set to this song often depict heartwarming scenarios like rescuing kittens from roadsides.

## Benefits of creating a TikTok songs playlist

TikTok playlists provide an effective and straightforward way to promote and showcase the videos that matter most. Plus, they help connect with fellow tiktokkers while building community. Playlists are easy to create and can have an immediate and significant effect on video engagement!

Every video uploaded to TikTok includes an accompanying sound - either from its Sound Library or created specifically by its creator - which may become viral and appear in multiple other videos across the platform.

Metro Boomin's song Creepin' has been used in over 17K videos, cementing his status as one of the premier hip-hop producers on the scene.

Although it's essential to keep up with trends and what's trending on TikTok, finding a balance is also key. Not all trends will resonate with your target audience and some songs might not match the vibe of your content - therefore having an eclectic playlist is key!

## Understanding the TikTok algorithm

TikTok boasts an innovative algorithm that determines how music is distributed and consumed on its platform. This feedback-driven system rewards content that resonates with users and keeps the app's offerings varied and engaging - thus understanding its workings is critical for success on TikTok.

Example: if a user watches an entire video from start to finish, the algorithm will know they enjoyed it and show more videos by that creator in their For You feed. As a result, creating engaging videos is essential - this means producing clips with captivating hooks that keep viewers watching from start to finish!

Rewatch and share rates can also affect a video's reach; it's important to remember, though, that YouTube's algorithm does not discriminate based on follower count or number of ads run; new accounts have the same potential to go viral as established creators in terms of video reach on this platform.

## Researching popular TikTok songs and trends

TikTok users are known for their creativity and passions, with music serving as a powerful medium that can set the scene of any video. From lip-syncs to dance challenges, users use music as an expressive and connecting outlet on TikTok.

TikTok's popularity has inspired several tools and apps that help identify popular trends, making it easier to create engaging playlists using this resource.

TikTok songs that have relatable themes or stories tend to be highly sought-after. Lil Nas X's ""Old Town Road"" captures rural America perfectly while Saweetie's ""Throwback"" boasts catchy beats and upbeat harmonies that resonate with listeners.

TrendTok, vidIQ Viral and RealTrends are among several apps designed to track trending songs on TikTok, giving users access to song rankings, popularity graphs and chart data for songs trending on TikTok. Some even provide analytics regarding these tracks such as play time or their use in other videos.

## Choosing a theme or mood for your playlist

TikTok playlists should reflect the mood or theme you wish for your video to express, such as dance challenges or catchy pop hits that people can dance along to, as well as songs with messages that resonate with viewers and users alike.

TikTok users were entranced by ""La La La"" as it provided the soundtrack to their ""Hand Emoji Challenge."" For this competition, participants must match hand emoji shapes on their screens with the beat of each song; video results range from silly to touching and frequently feature participants' friends or family.

Other songs have gone viral for more specific reasons, like Kygo and Zedd's hit single ""Touch It."" Its catchy tune has been used in numerous ways on TikTok, from fashion shows to workout routines and makeup tutorials; other videos use it as an outlet to share personal experiences or recreate scenes from movies or TV shows they love.

## Curating a diverse selection of songs

Tik Tok can make songs viral through video content that's engaging, inspiring, or humorous - as well as easily replicated and remixed by users. Doja Cat's song ""Say So"" went viral after one user uploaded and shared a 15-second dance video featuring its sounds onto their FYP page.

Remix artists have become an integral part of many artists and record labels' music marketing strategies, giving them access to new audiences while encouraging more people to buy their music.

Your playlist must include an eclectic collection of songs. A combination of fast and slow songs from different genres will ensure that videos remain entertaining to all audiences. To identify popular tracks on TikTok or Spotify's Trending Playlists (these playlists contain popular songs as well as anticipated hits for future use), try apps such as Creative Center or Trending Playlists - they offer insight into which tracks may do well in future years.

## Structuring your playlist for maximum engagement

TikTok videos offer one of the best ways to reach a wide audience and promote songs, but understanding its workings and how to get noticed by its algorithm are critical components to its success.

TikTok users can create videos using pre-approved royalty free music that has been uploaded to the platform or choose from its library of trending sounds or songs curated by other users. TikTok encourages its users to make creative, fun content that engages and shares easily.

Dance challenges on YouTube have become a popular way for users to interact and generate millions of views for songs they easily reenact, potentially catapulting it to the top of charts and becoming viral on the platform. Alternately, creating challenges with an easily imitated song can inspire others to recreate your video and bring millions more views and potentially catapult it onto them charts! Or it can help develop influencer campaigns surrounding specific artists or songs which allow for building dedicated followership and increasing your chances of going viral.

Playlist Push can also help your songs gain exposure on TikTok by using its service to promote them. While Playlist Push was originally known for Spotify promotion, recently they expanded their offering to TikTok creators who may want to feature your song in videos they make - thus helping your song gain traction! When signing up with this service for a campaign with Playlist Push they will send your song out directly so they can feature it on For You Pages as soon as creators accept the invitation from Playlist Push and feature your track!

## The power of music on TikTok

TikTok has become one of the most potent platforms for music artists to reach a wide audience. Its unique format - 15-second videos enhanced with effects, filters and audio - enables users to unleash their creative side with no limits placed upon them. Music plays an integral role in these videos and can make or break its success.

TikTok boasts an expansive library of sound options, from iconic hits and contemporary renditions of timeless tunes, to niche tracks reinterpreted for this platform. Making use of one of these trending songs in your videos is effortless - simply enter shoot mode and select ""sounds"" at the bottom of the screen!

""Pieces,"" by pianist Danilo Stankovic is currently making waves for its ability to evoke emotion. Videos set to this song often depict heartwarming scenarios like rescuing kittens from roadsides.  Benefits of creating a TikTok songs playlist TikTok playlists provide an effective and straightforward way to promote and showcase the videos that matter most. Plus, they help connect with fellow tiktokkers while building community. Playlists are easy to create and can have an immediate and significant effect on video engagement! Every video uploaded to TikTok includes an accompanying sound - either from its Sound Library or created specifically by its creator - which may become viral and appear in multiple other videos across the platform. Metro Boomin's song Creepin' has been used in over 17K videos, cementing his status as one of the premier hip-hop producers on the scene. Although it's essential to keep up with trends and what's trending on TikTok, finding a balance is also key. Not all trends will resonate with your target audience and some songs might not match the vibe of your content - therefore having an eclectic playlist is key!  Understanding the TikTok algorithm TikTok boasts an innovative algorithm that determines how music is distributed and consumed on its platform. This feedback-driven system rewards content that resonates with users and keeps the app's offerings varied and engaging - thus understanding its workings is critical for success on TikTok. Example if a user watches an entire video from start to finish, the algorithm will know they enjoyed it and show more videos by that creator in their For You feed. As a result, creating engaging videos is essential - this means producing clips with captivating hooks that keep viewers watching from start to finish! Rewatch and share rates can also affect a video's reach; it's important to remember, though, that YouTube's algorithm does not discriminate based on follower count or number of ads run; new accounts have the same potential to go viral as established creators in terms of video reach on this platform.  Researching popular TikTok songs and trends TikTok users are known for their creativity and passions, with music serving as a powerful medium that can set the scene of any video. From lip-syncs to dance challenges, users use music as an expressive and connecting outlet on TikTok. TikTok's popularity has inspired several tools and apps that help identify popular trends, making it easier to create engaging playlists using this resource. TikTok songs that have relatable themes or stories tend to be highly sought-after. Lil Nas X's ""Old Town Road"" captures rural America perfectly while Saweetie's ""Throwback"" boasts catchy beats and upbeat harmonies that resonate with listeners. TrendTok, vidIQ Viral and RealTrends are among several apps designed to track trending songs on TikTok, giving users access to song rankings, popularity graphs and chart data for songs trending on TikTok. Some even provide analytics regarding these tracks such as play time or their use in other videos.  Choosing a theme or mood for your playlist TikTok playlists should reflect the mood or theme you wish for your video to express, such as dance challenges or catchy pop hits that people can dance along to, as well as songs with messages that resonate with viewers and users alike. TikTok users were entranced by ""La La La"" as it provided the soundtrack to their ""Hand Emoji Challenge."" For this competition, participants must match hand emoji shapes on their screens with the beat of each song; video results range from silly to touching and frequently feature participants' friends or family. Other songs have gone viral for more specific reasons, like Kygo and Zedd's hit single ""Touch It."" Its catchy tune has been used in numerous ways on TikTok, from fashion shows to workout routines and makeup tutorials; other videos use it as an outlet to share personal experiences or recreate scenes from movies or TV shows they love.  Curating a diverse selection of songs Tik Tok can make songs viral through video content that's engaging, inspiring, or humorous - as well as easily replicated and remixed by users. Doja Cat's song ""Say So"" went viral after one user uploaded and shared a 15-second dance video featuring its sounds onto their FYP page. Remix artists have become an integral part of many artists and record labels' music marketing strategies, giving them access to new audiences while encouraging more people to buy their music. Your playlist must include an eclectic collection of songs. A combination of fast and slow songs from different genres will ensure that videos remain entertaining to all audiences. To identify popular tracks on TikTok or Spotify's Trending Playlists (these playlists contain popular songs as well as anticipated hits for future use), try apps such as Creative Center or Trending Playlists - they offer insight into which tracks may do well in future years.  Structuring your playlist for maximum engagement TikTok videos offer one of the best ways to reach a wide audience and promote songs, but understanding its workings and how to get noticed by its algorithm are critical components to its success. TikTok users can create videos using pre-approved royalty free music that has been uploaded to the platform or choose from its library of trending sounds or songs curated by other users. TikTok encourages its users to make creative, fun content that engages and shares easily. Dance challenges on YouTube have become a popular way for users to interact and generate millions of views for songs they easily reenact, potentially catapulting it to the top of charts and becoming viral on the platform. Alternately, creating challenges with an easily imitated song can inspire others to recreate your video and bring millions more views and potentially catapult it onto them charts!

4. wash my hands of it and start writing new music again.

Is there a preferred order of operations?  Are there preferred services for distribution / light playlist pushing?  is 2 a waste of money?

I released a 4 track ep in 2020 and did a playlist push campaign for 1 song which got 14k plays but none organically and that's it. Now I'm releasing again and not using playlist campaigns but instead using Facebook ads. I've only started to get Radio and Release Radar plays since the 25th day after release on this single and the numbers are still small:

Radio: 91 
Release Radar: 32

Stats 27 days after release 
Streams: 8,800
Listeners: 2,500 
Saves: 465 
Playlist adds : 340 
Popularity score: 30%

So my popularity score only passed the 20% - 30% range the past few days but release radar has only started on the last week of my first month which I though is strange.

I'm hoping to get on discover weekly next Monday with these kind of stats but who knows right.

My question is, with a popularity score like this and these kind of stats is Release Radar just totally random because at this point 32 streams seems small compared to what others say they have got in this sub with way worse stats.

In this exciting story from **Darren**, we embark on a journey filled with music, dedication, and growth. Our protagonist's Spotify profile was a quiet place, with few followers and minimal song plays. As a music producer, specializing in the realms of hip-hop and house music, the struggle to finish and promote tracks was an ever-present challenge.

The turning point arrived in 2020 when a new direction beckoned. House music became the focus, complete with a fresh artist image and a new name. The central question was how to organically nurture a fan base. The answer was clear: genuine followers were the key, with streams following naturally.

The journey reached a critical juncture upon the discovery of the **Spotify Growth Switch**. This online coaching program provided the blueprint for an automated growth strategy on Spotify. The journey of success commenced with ad campaigns, strategically running in tandem with the creation of house music. The breakthrough came when an instrumental track featured in the first ad captured substantial attention.

To foster more followers, a curated playlist was crafted, supported by platforms like SubmitHub and Playlist Push. This strategic move breathed life into the playlist and translated into noticeable revenue growth. The ad budget scaled up consistently, with an astute breakdown of ad sets by country and the incorporation of a lookalike audience.

Throughout, **a valuable lesson was learned: consistency and patience are the cornerstones of success**. Ad campaigns never halted, and this unyielding commitment resulted in remarkable growth over time. Just a month ago, a significant milestone was achieved - a community of 10,000 Spotify followers, accompanied by a consistent rise in song plays. But this isn't the end; the quest now aims for an incredible 100,000 followers. 🥳

This journey stands as a testament to inspire fellow musicians and creators. The music industry's path is challenging, but with the right strategy and unwavering determination, dreams can be realized. Feel free to ask questions or share your own experiences.

As an indie artist, you have the freedom and flexibility to create and release music on your own terms. But you also face the challenge of promoting your music without the support of a label or a team. How do you get your music heard by more people and grow your fanbase? Here are some of the best ways to promote your music as an indie artist.

&amp;#x200B;

* Distribute your music widely. The first step in promoting your music is making it available on all the major streaming platforms, such as Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, Amazon Music, and more. You can use a music distribution company like CD Baby or DistroKid to upload your music across these platforms for a fee. This way, you can reach more listeners and earn royalties from streams.

&amp;#x200B;

* Build your website. Your website is your home base on the internet where you can showcase your music, bio, photos, videos, tour dates, merch store, blog posts, and more. You can use a website builder like Bandzoogle or Squarespace to create a professional-looking website in minutes with all the features you need. Your website should also have a signup form for your email list so that you can collect contact information from your fans and keep in touch with them.

&amp;#x200B;

* Grow your email list. Your email list is one of the most valuable assets you have as an indie artist. It allows you to communicate directly with your fans without relying on social media algorithms or platforms. You can use email marketing tools like Mailchimp or ConvertKit to send newsletters, updates, offers, and exclusive content to your subscribers. You can also use incentives like free downloads or discounts to encourage people to sign up for your list.

&amp;#x200B;

* Leverage social media. Social media is a great way to connect with your fans and potential fans on a personal level. You can use platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, and more to share your music, behind-the-scenes, stories, live streams, polls, contests, and more. You can also use social media ads to reach new audiences and drive traffic to your website, streaming platforms, or email list.

&amp;#x200B;

* Collaborate with other artists. Collaborating with other artists is a win-win situation for both parties. You can expose your music to each other’s fanbases, cross-promote your releases, and create something new and exciting together. You can collaborate with artists who have a similar genre, style, or audience as you, or you can experiment with different genres and styles to expand your musical horizons. You can also collaborate with artists who have a larger or more engaged fanbase than you and leverage their influence and credibility.

&amp;#x200B;

* Pitch to playlists. Playlists are one of the most effective ways to get your music discovered by new listeners and increase your streams. You can pitch your music to playlists on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, and other platforms using various methods. You can use Spotify’s official playlist submission tool to pitch your music to their editorial team. You can also use third-party services like SubmitHub or Playlist Push to pitch your music to independent curators. You can also network with other artists and playlisters and ask them to add your music to their playlists.

&amp;#x200B;

* Perform live. Performing live is one of the best ways to promote your music as an indie artist. It allows you to showcase your talent, charisma, and personality on stage and create a memorable experience for your fans. You can also sell merch and CDs at your shows and collect email addresses from attendees. You can perform live at local venues, festivals, open mics, or online platforms like Twitch or StageIt.

Playlist Push requires hundreds of dollars and you don’t get to see who you submit to until after you spend your money. It’s a huge gamble. You could find out after they take your money that half the playlists weren’t even a good fit in the first place 

Submithub lets you do research beforehand which is cool but they pay less. It’s a lot of work to be a quality curator/influencer and they deserve to get paid. It’s better for promoters to be somewhere like PlaylistPush because they get paid more, but this hurts artists 

If submithub raised its prices it would attract more quality promoters and we as artists could make more educated decisions. We also wouldn’t waste as much money.

Something’s gotta change because music promo is too expensive. You either have to be a TikTok fiend and post 5x a day or you have to spend 500$+ on mystery playlist promo and get ripped off. Or run ads but that’s also expensive and has a high learning curve

These mystery box playlist companies like PlayListPush have got to go, or be more transparent. And submithub should do a better job of amassing quality. I imagine that means increasing their prices a bit. The max is 4 credits? Folks on PlaylistPush can make like 10$ per submission.

Hope you doin well. I'm independent musician for more than 7 years. You already know how it's such a trouble to promote your own music as independent musicians. I had this problem as well but this issue really start to get so much annoying for me. In deep Im about to give it up.

Let me write you which Spotify promotion &amp; marketing methods I've tried so far.

1- Google ads - Obviously useless for musician

2- Ig Ads - Better than google but not effective again

3- Playlist Promotion website: Like soundcampaign, playlist push I almost spend more than 1.000 dolar on that website. Yeahh they put your song some organic playlist but maybe we gain about 10k stream totally. 1.000 dolar for 1.000 stream this is insane as I said. These are nice websites but for price and gain really I don't think people can work with these website more than 1

4- Tiktok influencer: Full of bot. For my last release I worked with 10 micro-influencer total 10m people watch these video but thats all! Even not small move to stream

5- Purchase Bot Streams: All musicians &amp; independent record labels around me talk about [Spotifypanel.com](https://Spotifypanel.com) for last 1 years which they always use their bot stream services to boost their spotify streams. As I know or heard lots of biggest world start using their services as well. We all know that these was not the solution in the long term or can hurt our profile. I make some try about 10 dolar. believe me or not but these plays has better outcome for me when I compare to other costly way. But This is just 10 dolar order Im'm not sure that you can build all your career on bot plays.

Shortly I need your advise guys :) Really gladly appreciate all your advice.

Lest you think I am just a shill, I also share my bad experiences, such as this post from several months ago about how playlist push is terrible (An opinion I still stand by) [https://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriting/comments/veeuse/comment/j2vsw8i/?%2524](https://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriting/comments/veeuse/comment/j2vsw8i/?%2524)

Prior to using yougrow, I used the aforementioned playlist push as well as submithub and groover. The problem with all 3 is they make you go through and pitch yourself to the playlists, and many of their playlists are terrible. So I get so many responses with them from playlisters saying ""your song is great, but doesn't fit my style"" Then why did your algorithms recommend this person to me? And many of the playlists I have got from those services were worthless and gave me a couple dozen streams. And if you're wondering why I particularly think playlist push is a scam and not submithub or groover, it's because of price. The latter 2 charge you a buck or two per send, so not a big deal if you strike out. PP charges hundreds, or thousands depending on the package, and gives you no guarantee you'll get on any playlist. 

Someone actually on here recommended yougrow to me, and it's worked great. For one, after you pay them THEY pitch your song to playlists they think it is a fit for. And you get your money back if they can't get it placed. So I chose their ""starter"" package which was like 67 bucks for 2-6k guaranteed streams. The playlist they got my song on had more than 225,000 likes (or saves or whatever they are) and the song so far has got 25k streams and counting, obviously way more than even what was promised. The song also got a lot of saves which has helped with the spotify algorithms, and I've obtained 135 new followers. In spotify streaming revenue, I've already made back like half my 67 dollar investment. 

Now, one thing I can't vouch for is their higher priced options. For example, if you choose the yougrow ""superstar"" option  for $1200 will you start getting millions of streams? I don't know. But the starter package has worked extremely well for me",1.0,1.0,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriting/comments/12ncu9s/i_recommend_yougrow_for_playlist_promotion/,I recommend Yougrow for playlist promotion,i recommend yougrow for playlist promotion,"So i just wanted to share with the crowd the good experience I had with a service called Yougrow for promotion.

But the starter package has worked extremely well for me","so i just wanted to share with the crowd the good experience i had with a service called yougrow for promotion. lest you think i am just a shill, i also share my bad experiences, such as this post from several months ago about how playlist push is terrible (an opinion i still stand by)  prior to using yougrow, i used the aforementioned playlist push as well as submithub and groover. the problem with all 3 is they make you go through and pitch yourself to the playlists, and many of their playlists are terrible. so i get so many responses with them from playlisters saying ""your song is great, but doesn't fit my style"" then why did your algorithms recommend this person to me? and many of the playlists i have got from those services were worthless and gave me a couple dozen streams. and if you're wondering why i particularly think playlist push is a scam and not submithub or groover, it's because of price. the latter 2 charge you a buck or two per send, so not a big deal if you strike out. pp charges hundreds, or thousands depending on the package, and gives you no guarantee you'll get on any playlist.  someone actually on here recommended yougrow to me, and it's worked great. for one, after you pay them they pitch your song to playlists they think it is a fit for. and you get your money back if they can't get it placed. so i chose their ""starter"" package which was like 67 bucks for 2-6k guaranteed streams. the playlist they got my song on had more than 225,000 likes (or saves or whatever they are) and the song so far has got 25k streams and counting, obviously way more than even what was promised. the song also got a lot of saves which has helped with the spotify algorithms, and i've obtained 135 new followers. in spotify streaming revenue, i've already made back like half my 67 dollar investment.  now, one thing i can't vouch for is their higher priced options. for example, if you choose the yougrow ""superstar"" option  for $1200 will you start getting millions of streams? i don't know. but the starter package has worked extremely well for me",6,379
