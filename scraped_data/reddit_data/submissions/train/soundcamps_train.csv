13gimll,1683987065,MusicPromotion,Intelligent-Leopard7,Best Spotify Promotion Methods?,"Hey Guys!

Hope you doin well. I'm independent musician for more than 7 years. You already know how it's such a trouble to promote your own music as independent musicians. I had this problem as well but this issue really start to get so much annoying for me. In deep Im about to give it up.

Let me write you which Spotify promotion &amp; marketing methods I've tried so far.

1- Google ads - Obviously useless for musician

2- Ig Ads - Better than google but not effective again

3- Playlist Promotion website: Like soundcampaign, playlist push I almost spend more than 1.000 dolar on that website. Yeahh they put your song some organic playlist but maybe we gain about 10k stream totally. 1.000 dolar for 1.000 stream this is insane as I said. These are nice websites but for price and gain really I don't think people can work with these website more than 1

4- Tiktok influencer: Full of bot. For my last release I worked with 10 micro-influencer total 10m people watch these video but thats all! Even not small move to stream

5- Purchase Bot Streams: All musicians &amp; independent record labels around me talk about [Spotifypanel.com](https://Spotifypanel.com) for last 1 years which they always use their bot stream services to boost their spotify streams. As I know or heard lots of biggest world start using their services as well. We all know that these was not the solution in the long term or can hurt our profile. I make some try about 10 dolar. believe me or not but these plays has better outcome for me when I compare to other costly way. But This is just 10 dolar order Im'm not sure that you can build all your career on bot plays.

Shortly I need your advise guys :) Really gladly appreciate all your advice.

qc4r8n,1634747203,MusicPromotion,DDReyMusic,DON'T USE SOUNDCAMPAIGN [CURATORS],"Hey there,

I'm a music curator on Spotify, I own a large network of playlists and I've been working as curator on platforms such as Submithub, Playlister Club, Groover... 

Well, I used to work on Soundcampaign for a while and I noticed many things:

\- They don't have any filter for the artists / music, most of the music I received sounded like a produced just opened a DAW for the 1st time, which means they're not going to be picked by us and the platform is literally taking their money.

\- As curators, the 1st point I explained means that we're the 'bad' guys from the artist perspective, so we can get negative reviews from the artists.

\- Then comes Soundcampaign and say your 'reviews' aren't being good enough (which are very extended and well developed, never had any complaint on Submithub for example) and they use that excuse to avoid paying us for our work.

So, the point is: Soundcampaing is a complete SCAM, for both artists and curators.

If you really want to dig-in, find some sites that you can check curators, their lists, genre diversity etc. There're lots of them.  


In s.c. ; you dont even know who just listened your song &amp; album :)  


Summary for the S.C. ''campaign'' :  


Paid 90 USD for potencially 14k listeners (according to s.c). Result: Not even 30! Added 3 playlists also (all p.lists have min 600 followers). So, i don't think these playlists alive enough :)  


I can easily say that, it's not a living area. They need to change their business set but i don't think they 'll. Anyway s.c. is continuing to earn money :)

NEW INFO :  
I read their answer (down below). Another quick summary for you:  


There 're 2 variables for the campaign's price:  


1. Curator numbers  
2. ''Potencially'' playlist follower numbers  


Also there were 2 option for my budget:  


1. 56 USD for 6 curators and nearly 5000 playlist followers  
2. 90 USD for 6 curators and nearly 14000 playlist followers.  


So they 're using ''POTENCIALLY'' PLAYLIST FOLLOWER NUMBERS for campaign price. But after a unsuccesfull result, repeating this: ''We're not selling streams. ''  


Yes, we know that and it's not the point.

We also are known for having one of THE BEST sound systems on the playa outside of the soundcamps--plus a stripper pole if you really wanna get down to the rhythms of cumbia, reggaeton, salsa, etc.

Come get a YEAH MAN stamp on your bum during out “Booty Slap Happy Hour”. We are LGBTQ friendly and offer diversity in all senses of the word -- including diversity within our interactivity and camp members. We have an 8′ x 16′ stage, where in the past, we’ve hosted workshops and performances of many kinds. At this time, we are still curating our stage lineup. Perhaps you have an interactivity you’d like to host?

The Good: most people. I have nothing but positive things to say about the vast majority of attendees once again. 
The neutral: vendor prices. I get it but damn. Lines to get in were as expected.
The bad: sound bleed. Chads. The rumor mill.
The downright ugly: all the fucking laced drugs. Especially from the guy in the RV lot a ton of the laced stuff was traced back to. I hope you rot in a cell for the rest of your miserable life. The tractor driver: fuck you. The guy stealing everyones phones: ~100 phones @ 1k apiece is a 100k theft felony. Enjoy it fuckwad.

Holy fuck are all of you who camped &amp; got in and had a great weekend absolute champs. I cannot applaud you enough. Kudos to X for finally figuring it out and getting everyone in. To everyone who won’t stop bitching, I get it, but chill. X, Mr. Jeff, Livornooooo’s other half: the communication leading up to the festival until basically Friday was ATROCIOUS. Please be better. I assume the lack of info was due to decisions needing to be made to get people in safely.
The music: wow. We crossed genres all weeekend and didn’t find a set we didn’t enjoy. The artists really went all in this weekend.
The stages: THE NEW DESIGNS WOW. The sound bleed especially in the back needs to be fixed. I shouldn’t hear X playing during Boogie T. Overall massive upgrade for the soundcamps.

In general LOVED the festival expansion. I have faith the logistical issues will be addressed.


Attendees/rumor mill: test. Your. Fucking. Drugs. 
Massive shoutout to Bunk Police, Dancesafe, the very overworked medical staff &amp; security team who all went harder than ANYONE on the rail just trying to keep people safe. 

My thoughts are with the family of the person who OD’d at the Red Roof Inn pre festival.

(I know I know, wandering around is the best, but there may be some spots people don't consider going to).

Places I love:
1) Hardly at 4:30 and A(need to confirm for 2016)- well I camp there for one and consider it one of the best Bars on the Playa. It's a 24 hour shot Bar with a dance floor out front and a lot of fun events.
2) Golden Cafe at the BR French Quarter 7:30ish and B?- really awesome daytime bar with good live music. I think I saw Seth Rogan there, but well you know...
3) Barbie Death Camp (7:30ish)- just awesome
4) Thunderdome 4:00 and Esplanade- Master Blaster says EMBARGO! Just killer to watch beautiful people bash each other with Nerf
5) Distrikt 9:00 and G- one of my favorite daytime soundcamps. Bike parking is stoopid and there is piss everywhere but I love it anyway. Killer, wonderful bunch of people.
6)Ride on the Robot Heart- find it and try to climb aboard or just hang out and watch....whatever, it's all good. I love a lot of their DJ's.
7) Mayan Warrior Art Car- just fantastic
8) HOTD near Rods Road- Another really cool bar. Runs 24 hours, lots of fun.
9) Pink Mammoth- Great DJs and dranks. Daytime party.
10) Bubbles and Bass- just reminds me of the scene where Dumbo ties one on.
11) Daft Punk Annual Party out in the  Deep Playa strait out from the temple most of the way out to the trash fence. BeTs drop at sundown on Wednesday. Do not miss this one brohs.
12) I'll keep adding as I remember things but please all throw out props for your favorite things to do.
13) Strap one on at the Black Rock Roller Disco
14) Make out with a like minded individual on the Ferris Wheel. Its terrifying, and someone will eventually die, but oh what a ride.
15) Grab your sack and ride on the slip and slide thingies

TLDR- post your favorite camps or things to do.

It's a 24 hour shot Bar with a dance floor out front and a lot of fun events. 2) Golden Cafe at the BR French Quarter 730ish and B?- really awesome daytime bar with good live music. I think I saw Seth Rogan there, but well you know... 3) Barbie Death Camp (730ish)- just awesome 4) Thunderdome 400 and Esplanade- Master Blaster says EMBARGO! Just killer to watch beautiful people bash each other with Nerf 5) Distrikt 900 and G- one of my favorite daytime soundcamps. Bike parking is stoopid and there is piss everywhere but I love it anyway. Killer, wonderful bunch of people. 6)Ride on the Robot Heart- find it and try to climb aboard or just hang out and watch....whatever, it's all good. I love a lot of their DJ's. 7) Mayan Warrior Art Car- just fantastic 8) HOTD near Rods Road- Another really cool bar. Runs 24 hours, lots of fun. 9) Pink Mammoth- Great DJs and dranks. Daytime party. 10) Bubbles and Bass- just reminds me of the scene where Dumbo ties one on. 11) Daft Punk Annual Party out in the  Deep Playa strait out from the temple most of the way out to the trash fence. BeTs drop at sundown on Wednesday. Do not miss this one brohs. 12) I'll keep adding as I remember things but please all throw out props for your favorite things to do. 13) Strap one on at the Black Rock Roller Disco 14) Make out with a like minded individual on the Ferris Wheel. Its terrifying, and someone will eventually die, but oh what a ride. 15) Grab your sack and ride on the slip and slide thingies TLDR- post your favorite camps or things to do.
