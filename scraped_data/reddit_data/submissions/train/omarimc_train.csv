veeuse,1655477246.0,Songwriting,Big-Association-239,Plalylist Push is a Scam,"So, I play 2-4 gigs a month and get paid a few hundred bucks apiece for them, nothing near enough to become a professional, but I thought I'd take some of that money and reinvest it in my music and delve into the wide world of music marketing services. I'm posting my results here for others who are thinking of paying to promote their music. I also would love any advice from those who have done this sort of thing 

To begin, as noted in my title, Playlist Push is a complete scam. I repeat, DO NOY WASTE YOUR MONEY ON PLAYLIST PUSH. I paid them $300 to send a song to their list of ""curated playlists"" the song got put on zero playlists. That's right, 300 dollars for literally nothing. Worse, I got many responses from playlist owners that the song was really good but didn't fit the style of their playlist. So why did Playlist Push send to them? What a joke, so much for ""curated."" Even worse, I sent the exact same song to 15 playlist curators via Submithub and got 2 accepted. So I got about a 10% acceptance rate -- versus 0% -- doing it myself, and more importantly only cost about $20 worth of credits to do so on Submit Hub. If you take one thing away from this post PLEASE DON'T USE PLAYLIST PUSH!

Some other services I used to varying degrees of success:

OmariMC, which claims to get you guaranteed listens. I used their ""bronze""  tier which for $77 says they will get your song 500-5000 plays on spotify. Mine got 1200 as of now, so that's nice. I'm under no illusion that 1200 people actually listened to my song, I'm sure they use bots, but at least I got something to show for my money, unlike Playlist Push.

I decide to use twitter ads, boosting a tweet I sent that had a link to the song. I spent 100 bucks to boost for 5 days. While the tweet got over 100 likes it only got 1 rewteet, resulted in only 1 new follower and had only  13 clickthroughs on the link to the song. So, not great.

I also paid 25 bucks through Reverbnation to have a ""digital ad"" show up on Facebook and other social media platforms. Unfortunately these ads lead those who click on it to your reverbnation page and not spotify/youtube etc and i have no idea how to monetize reverbnation. I also don't trust their statistics; they claim I am the 33rd most popular artist in my region; Well I am in the NYC region and I seriously doubt with all the signed/professional musicians in the NYC area plus the thousands of unsigned acts that I am number 33. But the ad did get 40-50 people to listen to songs on my reverb nation page. For 25 bucks, probably the best value of all the things I did.

I wanted to post this to give real life examples to those who are considering paying for a music promotion service. I was able to reinvest my extra money from gigs into this, but I know many musicians do not have the extra 5-600 bucks to throw at promotion so wanted to help anyone thinking about it. Definitely avoid Playlist Push at all costs. I guess for value the reverbnation ad and submit hub got the best bang for my buck. Omari delivered on what they promised, but I suspect they use bots.

Promotion may seem so simple, but most artists don’t have this part of the process thought out and need help finding the right solutions for marketing their singles and albums.

Audience retention from the ad is extremely low, by 1:30 into the video it's 4%.","So I ran a small (lowest tier - $77) ad from OmariMC on my video ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPivalc5JP0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPivalc5JP0) )

You can run YouTube discovery ads yourself but OmariMC claims that their service is superior because they have experience running ads and know how to target them really well to get the most engagement. So this claim is total bullshit. They will get you views but the engagement is horrible.

This video has performed well on Instagram getting me about 10 followers for every $5.80-$6 all from USA and Canada (these regions are expensive for ads). I really don't think it's that the video is bad. Especially because my organic audience retention is doing fine.

Audience retention for YouTube to recommend videos is roughly at least 30-35% average. My average retention from organic promotion meets this bar but the Omari ad is dragging it WAYYYY down. I actually asked him to pull the ad because it's so low. At 1 minute 30 seconds in the retention from the OmariMC ad is fuckin 4 PERCENT. Like uhhh. Highly targeted my ass. At 2 minutes in it's 2%. You can view your organic vs ad retention and the graph of audience retention from the Ad is an exponential decay graph. I looked at the demographics and it's being shown to 87% people from age 25-65. I emailed support saying that this was not my target audience and asking politely for them to change my audience targeting by age. No reply. Day 4 (today) I finally just asked them to scrap the ad and refund me because the product was falsely advertised to have high engagement and targeting and it is not performing.

From what I can tell this company relies on inexperienced musicians who want to get their view count up but don't have a good understanding of their advanced YouTube analytics. You are much better off running the ads yourself. If you have an understanding of your actual potential fan base, your targeting will be better than theirs because it couldn't really get any worse! I really don't even trust that these views are organic at this point.

Some of them poor money into promotion, or to be placed on playlists, and in return have very few fans. They are easily taken advantage of, by scam promotion companies, promising them something that they can not provide: fans. 

A few of these companies to watch out for are OmariMC, Industry All Access, Indie Power, Diamoon Media, and many more!

To those musicians that are lost, I want to offer a bit of advice. **I wouldn’t suggest investing money into promotion, or advertisement, until you are ready to perform live!** I also wouldn't suggest investing money into your music until you have built yourself a place for fans to follow you!

&amp;#x200B;

Notice these artists have Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Holly even has a personal website! I'd also like to point out that BOTH of these artists are performing live! These things are really important to do, especially performing live! **If you aren't willing to play live, you will be giving yourself a huge disadvantage**.  

See what the famous Record Label Deathwish Inc has to say about the issue: 

**Deathwish Inc. Records**: [https://deathwishinc.tumblr.com/post/99734256907/do-you-guys-still-take-submissions](https://deathwishinc.tumblr.com/post/99734256907/do-you-guys-still-take-submissions)

We do take still submissions at demos@deathwishinc.com (links only, no attachments please) but to be honest, we’ve never worked with a band who has just submitted us a demo unsolicited.  

The best way to get your band heard or noticed, by us, **or any label** is just go out and play shows.  We are constantly being hit up by friends, “Hey have you heard of \_\_\_\_\_\_?  They played this show I was at the other day and they were awesome, you guys should check them out.”  

&amp;#x200B;

So it is very apparent that there are few record labels that will sign anyone that isn't performing live. They need to hear about you by word of mouth. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Submit your music to college radios!**

 

Campus radios want to hear your music! They are hoping you will send it to them, so that they can include it in their broadcasts! You don't have to be local, but if you are, be sure to let them know it! Offer to do an interview, and to play live for them! They want to support local artists, and they have the money to do it!
