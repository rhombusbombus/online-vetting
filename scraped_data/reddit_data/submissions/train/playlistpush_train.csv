17qj46r,1699440841.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,hawkeyereis,Lost and at my wit's end: my experience with a PR company,"I've been playing music my whole life, writing and recording for the past 8 years. This is my 6th studio album release as a self funded artist playing acoustic rock with very minimal commerical success. 

For my latest album, I recorded overseas in Austin, Texas and decided to put as much strategy as possible into marketing my latest single, an upbeat pop-punk, fast tune as best I could.

I've tried a number of different techniques: playing open mics, playing album releases, touring, submithub, playlistpush with limited success. I reached a max of 3,000 streams on Spotify and some isolated community radio plays.

I asked around and was advised to hire a PR company to try to ""break into radio."" Here in Australia we have only one station to promote new artists that aren't signed to a major label, and that is Triple J, a government funded station with a quota for a number of Australian artists they have to play each week. 

I approached a number of different agencies with minimal success, the only agency who took me seriously was Beehive PR, based in Manly, Sydney. I spent $1500 AUD (about a month's rent, approx $1000 USD) for ""Editorials and Radio Pitching."" They were a pleasure to deal with, very professional, slick and easy, but I 
- barely saw 1,000 streams on Spotify, 
- had a total of three write ups on small magazines, with no new followers on social media as a result
- and the same isolated community radio play I had without a PR company. 

I asked about larger radio stations, namely the pop-punk and heavy show short.fast.loud on Triple J and was told unfortunately they had ""passed"" on the track. 

At this point, I'm really lost. I don't know what to do. I think either
a) my music stinks
b) there's something I'm missing here, whether it's a paywall/labels in control of triple J/marketing/social media.
c) something else.

On their journey to find good tools to do that, they often came across some playlist pitching services that give the impression to generate 1.000s of organic plays on spotify for a low budget.

I thought I could give this services a test run. For that I choose a fresh released song on a new spotify profile. The song is a pop song, that would fit in a broad spectrum of genres: Pop, indie pop, alt. pop, electro pop, singer/songwriter etc. Song has been rated as top 10% song by independent rating services. That means its not a bad song at all and with correct marketing you could get this to a very high play count on spotify and could build a brand from there.

First service I tested was [submithub.com](https://submithub.com/). You can buy credits and then submit your song to playlist curators. Cost is between $1-3 per curator. You choose the curators yourself. I bought 50 Creds = around $50 and submit to 19 curators. I got 2 positive responses and was added to two playlists. One was very good, generated around 400 plays and the others generated 80 plays.

Then I tested [Mysphera.co](https://mysphera.co/) cost is around $40, you get your money back if your song is not featured by any of their tastemakers. The song was added to 4 playlists and they generated 21 plays in total(!).

Next was [omarimc.com](https://omarimc.com/). I paid $150 with an expected result of \~1.000 to 10.000 plays. I was added to probably 11 playlists (not sure because you dont get any direct information only via spotontrack). Everything looks a bit shady, playlist look random generated (""Greatest hits of -add a movie here-"" -style), it resulted in \~750 plays.

Then [SoundCampaign.com](https://soundcampaign.com/) I paid $140 and they choose 14 curators to submit my track to. I got feedback from all and none of them wanted to feature my song.

Finally [playlistpush.com](https://playlistpush.com/) I paid $300. I was added to one playlist that generated 320 plays.

ih4p6s,1598467446.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,TheRealKaiLord,PSA: How to tell when Spotify playlists and plays are fake,"We all see shit like this:

""10-15k Guaranteed plays on 12 Playlists for $50 - get your music heard!""

If  you message these people they will send you a bunch of screen shots  from satisfied customers, some will be small time artists, some will be  huge with 200k + followers.

Some might be successful, but most will only have 'bot clout.'

It's really hard to tell when someone's Spotify is just bots if you don't know what to look for - here is what to look for.

Monthly  listeners to total plays - If they have 50k plays on their top song,  and 40k monthly listeners, they recently bought all of those plays.  Because if they really had that kind of listener base MONTHLY, their  total plays would be way higher.

Monthly  listeners to followers - If they have 40k monthly listeners and 300  followers, no one really fucks with them, they paid for the plays.

Where  people are listening - If you see cities like, Los Angeles, Dallas,  Phoenix, Kansas City, Buffalo, London GB, Frankfurt, etc.. these cities  are big data centers where botters can buy a whole bunch of IP addresses  to do fake shit. No one gets above 10% of their listeners from Dallas  unless they are a local act. So getting above 10% from multiple large  cities is simply impossible.

Before  you go checking every spotify playlist promotion to see which ones give  'real' results and which ones are fake... let me spoil it for you. They  are all fake.

Here are the things  that are difficult to do, expensive, still full of bullshit, but can  potentially work (that I'm aware of) submithub, playlistpush and good  old emailing/messaging individual playlist owners

Also,  if you're thinking, meh, I'll do it anyway for the clout, it'll make  other people listen and follow because I'll seem successful. Be the fuck  ware. Because Spotify has come down on bot plays and will again. You do  not want their visible or invisible ban hammer to come down upon you.

1akm9xz,1707257447.0,musicmarketing,NoName22415,General Question - Where should I spend money on promotion?,"Hello,  
New to this community, I did read through the commonly asked questions and still just wanted to get a feel for others' experiences out there. I have a band, fairly newly formed, but has kind of built a small amount of momentum.   
We do all the self promotion stuff, have used submithub and submitlink, gone through the tedious processes of finding playlist curators and reaching out directly, all that stuff, basically if it can be done for free, we have and continue to do it.  
Personally, I do not like submithub or submitlink, and it has a lot to do with our music. We do reggae rock, and often the feedback is overwhelmingly positive, but we are either too heavy or not heavy enough to be appropriate for playlists, though we have gotten onto a few pretty good ones - its just not nearly the success rate that would make me want to continue to throw funds at these sites.   


The majority of our plays now come from spotify radio, which is nice, but we really want to see what we can do to push it to another level.   


We have a song releasing March 1st, and I am contemplating using Spotify Marquee, but there is so much conflicting information online. I have also heard good things about groover and haven't tried it, same with Playlist push.

Hi, i’m here to share my experience on SubmitHub, hoping to be usefull for someone.

I’ve  used this service for a couple of song, and since it’s a long post, i  want to start with the most faq i’ve read on reddit about this.

Yes  this website is legit, and it’s a great idea, should you use it? It’s  all about lucky, i probably won’t use it anymore, not because of the  service, that does what it should and the founder it’s always on the  chat to help and talk with people, but because curators, at least in my  experience, they are not open minded to listen something that try to  bring something different on the scene, there is a reason why we are  artists and not someone who clean a window, if i wanted to copy somone  else i whould chose another job.

With  the premium credits you will receive the feedback from curators, but  are not really helpfull, because someone could say your vocal is awesome  but the instrumental suck, and another one the opposite. My last song  was declined for sharing by all curators i’ve submitted, i want to copy  here all the feedback, because i think it worth reading to have an idea,  ofc i wont write who they are, but just the feedback.

**Feadback (all declined)**

Great  tune, loved the vocal as well as the bubbling house vibes on the  baseline. The drop is quite fresh and well produced and overall the  track sounds really fresh. Unfortunately, it's a bit too relaxing and  deep for us, sorry

""Fearless""  offers a very accessible and energetic Progressive House sound, the  melodic arrangements are impressive and super uplifting, the track has a  great deep invigorating energy and nice enigmatic ambiance, however,  although it is a quality production, it unfortunately wasn't quite  compelling enough for a blog feature, I'm sorry

Thanks  for submitting! I like the very nostalgic and sweet melodies of the  song but the drop is not as energetic as I expected, the kick is a  little too thin and flat and the bass not deep.

Hey  there, Cool instrumental and very vibey sound design &amp; chords !  We're not caught by the vocals on this one though. Thanks for sending

Good  production enjoyable beat and vocal arrangements unfortunately not  convinced on the melody so let's try your next thanks for submitting

Hey,  the intro and the vocals soudns really great of course but actually  dont really like the beat drop. Next time you should work a bit more on  it in my opinion.

Hey there, thanks for the submission. Instrumental is fine but vocal is not what we are looking for qualitywise. Sorry!

thanks  for submitting Fearless. Been so pumped with teh vocal, sadly the drop  turned out a bit too different than we expected. Hoped for a big  epxlisive one! :(

Hey, good track,  good production. I like the instrumental. Unfortunately I am not a fan  of the vocals. They sound too standard to me. Unfortunately they don't  kick me. Therefore, in this case I must decline. Nevertheless I wish you  a lot of success with this song! I'm sure it will find its fans. Thanks  for sending!

Nice instrumental. We don't feel the vocals enough. Thanks for submitting it to us

This  started of pretty good, really nice pads and great pluck. The vocal was  ok, it didnt sound great at times which didnt really let me enjoy the  song much. The production was quite clean but I didn't really enjoy the  drop much - it was missing alot of elements to keep it interesting.  Great concept though just needs a bit more work - Thanks for sending

the  song sounded quite good. This was definitely some high quality  production - The mix was dope and the elements used were good. The  melodies were catchy! Good job! Sadly here, i wasn't hooked by the vocal  topline (lyrics and melodies). Indeed, i felt like it was a bit  repetitive and linear for my personal tastes. I didn't feel like it was  professional enough.. :/ I know most people will love the song, but it  didn't convince me enough for me to support in my list this time. But  thank you for your submission. Have a good day and stay safe!

Even  though the song is not suitable for my playlist, cause I find it too  chill and not that commercial, I want to highlight the originality of  the instrumental

Hey, the mix and  master sounds really clean but actually dont really like the break  melody. Next time you should work more on it.

Hey  Frankie, thanks for reaching out. The idea is cool and it has  potential, but I'm afraid the mixing quality and the sound desing here  still sounds quite weak and messy, there's no contrast betweent the  different sections of the song.. not really meeting our quality  standards for a feature this time, I'm sorry. Wish you good luck with  your song release!

It's a  wonderful summer melody and music production is well done, but we  expected more developed progression..Anyway, keep creating

The  energy in the song is nice here. So not bad. But also a bit too beat  driven I would say as I was missing a more melodic production here to  make the song stand out enough for me. So not all the way this time.

I appreciate the songwriting, but I wasn't into the final mix of Fearless nor the vocal performance.

what we didn't enjoy here is unoriginal melodies, keep on, your voice is amazing

not a fan of the drop here but just my taste

Thanks  for submitting but I'm going to pass. The song has solid production  that sets a nice tone but vocally I feel the song could be stronger to  my personal ear. Best of luck to you

Congrats  on the single. Lovely dance. That ending wasn't what the beginning of  the song was teasing. Was hoping for a huge ending. But that's just us  FT. Nice house, indeed. Keep on kickin' as you do. Sorry couldn't pull  the trigger. Enjoy the accolades.

Cool  vibe on the soundscape and vocals. There's definitely some talent  there. For me, I would like to hear a more defining hook that we can  sink our teeth into overall though. This one felt a little too one note  for placement.

Super impressive  but sadly did get a bit repetitive for me. Surely might circle back  around to this one though after giving it some time and will reach  out..!

Production is really dope  here. Vocals need a little development, sonically fell a little short  for us. Keep it up though, production is dope

The intro got me hooked! The drop was however very underwhelming. I'd try adding a lead to it so it can shine!

Good  production. The track feels, however, a little on the familiar side and  might benefit from adding fresher sound elements, twists and turns to  really take off and stand out that much more in this genre.

Great  tune, loved the vocal as well as the bubbling house vibes on the  baseline. The drop is quite fresh and well produced and overall the  track sounds really fresh. Unfortunately, it's a bit too relaxing and  deep for us, sorry

The highs of  this song sound a little bit strange. Would work on that to get a proper  final track because the melody has a really good potential!

La chanson sonne très ordinaire, standard selon nous, peut être une autre

I  struggled a bit to stay dialed in on the vocals enough to connect  lyrically. The build and production are there, but I never found my one  moment to land with this one.

**My final thought**

As  you can see the most complain is the drop that isn’t huge, and surprise  surprise, this is what i wanted, i don’t wanna copy niky romero or  other artists, i wanna share my personal vibes, and when i listen a song  i’m looking for a contact with the artist, trying to feel what he felt,  i'm not trying to think about what he was supposed to do, the song is  his world and if he made a different choice there is a reason, and as  listener i try to understand it.

Music  is art, or it should be, i just immagine someone like Picasso in our  era where a curators will write “Sorry but i’m not  expected something  less messy, try to paint like Raffaello”

I can’t post links, but if someone is curious to listen the song send me a DM i will drop you the link

I’m also running a campaign on playlistpush, if this topic will reach some interest i will post my thought on that service too",5.0,0.7,12.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicproduction/comments/hha6qo/my_submithub_experience/,My submithub experience,my submithub experience,"  Hi, i’m here to share my experience on SubmitHub, hoping to be usefull for someone.

That ending wasn't what the beginning of  the song was teasing. Was hoping for a huge ending. But that's just us  FT. Nice house, indeed. Keep on kickin' as you do. Sorry couldn't pull  the trigger. Enjoy the accolades. Cool  vibe on the soundscape and vocals. There's definitely some talent  there. For me, I would like to hear a more defining hook that we can  sink our teeth into overall though. This one felt a little too one note  for placement. Super impressive  but sadly did get a bit repetitive for me. Surely might circle back  around to this one though after giving it some time and will reach  out..! Production is really dope  here. Vocals need a little development, sonically fell a little short  for us. Keep it up though, production is dope The intro got me hooked! The drop was however very underwhelming. I'd try adding a lead to it so it can shine! Good  production. The track feels, however, a little on the familiar side and  might benefit from adding fresher sound elements, twists and turns to  really take off and stand out that much more in this genre. Great  tune, loved the vocal as well as the bubbling house vibes on the  baseline. The drop is quite fresh and well produced and overall the  track sounds really fresh. Unfortunately, it's a bit too relaxing and  deep for us, sorry The highs of  this song sound a little bit strange. Would work on that to get a proper  final track because the melody has a really good potential! La chanson sonne très ordinaire, standard selon nous, peut être une autre I  struggled a bit to stay dialed in on the vocals enough to connect  lyrically. The build and production are there, but I never found my one  moment to land with this one. **My final thought** As  you can see the most complain is the drop that isn’t huge, and surprise  surprise, this is what i wanted, i don’t wanna copy niky romero or  other artists, i wanna share my personal vibes, and when i listen a song  i’m looking for a contact with the artist, trying to feel what he felt,  i'm not trying to think about what he was supposed to do, the song is  his world and if he made a different choice there is a reason, and as  listener i try to understand it. Music  is art, or it should be, i just immagine someone like Picasso in our  era where a curators will write “Sorry but i’m not  expected something  less messy, try to paint like Raffaello” I can’t post links, but if someone is curious to listen the song send me a DM i will drop you the link I’m also running a campaign on playlistpush, if this topic will reach some interest i will post my thought on that service too"

I’ve used this service for a couple of song, and since it’s a long post, i want to start with the most faq i’ve read on reddit about this.  

Yes this website is legit, and it’s a great idea, should you use it? It’s all about lucky, i probably won’t use it anymore, not because of the service, that does what it should and the founder it’s always on the chat to help and talk with people, but because curators, at least in my experience, they are not open minded to listen something that try to bring something different on the scene, there is a reason why we are artists and not someone who clean a window, if i wanted to copy somone else i whould chose another job.

With the premium credits you will receive the feedback from curators, but are not really helpfull, because someone could say your vocal is awesome but the instrumental suck, and another one the opposite. My last song was declined for sharing by all curators i’ve submitted, i want to copy here all the feedback, because i think it worth reading to have an idea, ofc i wont write who they are, but just the feedback.

**Feadback (all declined)**

Great tune, loved the vocal as well as the bubbling house vibes on the baseline. The drop is quite fresh and well produced and overall the track sounds really fresh. Unfortunately, it's a bit too relaxing and deep for us, sorry  

""Fearless"" offers a very accessible and energetic Progressive House sound, the melodic arrangements are impressive and super uplifting, the track has a great deep invigorating energy and nice enigmatic ambiance, however, although it is a quality production, it unfortunately wasn't quite compelling enough for a blog feature, I'm sorry  

Thanks for submitting! I like the very nostalgic and sweet melodies of the song but the drop is not as energetic as I expected, the kick is a little too thin and flat and the bass not deep.  

Hey there, Cool instrumental and very vibey sound design &amp; chords ! We're not caught by the vocals on this one though. Thanks for sending  

Good production enjoyable beat and vocal arrangements unfortunately not convinced on the melody so let's try your next thanks for submitting  

Hey, the intro and the vocals soudns really great of course but actually dont really like the beat drop. Next time you should work a bit more on it in my opinion.  

Hey there, thanks for the submission. Instrumental is fine but vocal is not what we are looking for qualitywise. Sorry!  

thanks for submitting Fearless. Been so pumped with teh vocal, sadly the drop turned out a bit too different than we expected. Hoped for a big epxlisive one! :(  

Hey, good track, good production. I like the instrumental. Unfortunately I am not a fan of the vocals. They sound too standard to me. Unfortunately they don't kick me. Therefore, in this case I must decline. Nevertheless I wish you a lot of success with this song! I'm sure it will find its fans. Thanks for sending!  

Nice instrumental. We don't feel the vocals enough. Thanks for submitting it to us  

This started of pretty good, really nice pads and great pluck. The vocal was ok, it didnt sound great at times which didnt really let me enjoy the song much. The production was quite clean but I didn't really enjoy the drop much - it was missing alot of elements to keep it interesting. Great concept though just needs a bit more work - Thanks for sending  

the song sounded quite good. This was definitely some high quality production - The mix was dope and the elements used were good. The melodies were catchy! Good job! Sadly here, i wasn't hooked by the vocal topline (lyrics and melodies). Indeed, i felt like it was a bit repetitive and linear for my personal tastes. I didn't feel like it was professional enough.. :/ I know most people will love the song, but it didn't convince me enough for me to support in my list this time. But thank you for your submission. Have a good day and stay safe!  

Even though the song is not suitable for my playlist, cause I find it too chill and not that commercial, I want to highlight the originality of the instrumental  

Hey, the mix and master sounds really clean but actually dont really like the break melody. Next time you should work more on it.  

Hey Frankie, thanks for reaching out. The idea is cool and it has potential, but I'm afraid the mixing quality and the sound desing here still sounds quite weak and messy, there's no contrast betweent the different sections of the song.. not really meeting our quality standards for a feature this time, I'm sorry. Wish you good luck with your song release!  

It's a wonderful summer melody and music production is well done, but we expected more developed progression..Anyway, keep creating  

The energy in the song is nice here. So not bad. But also a bit too beat driven I would say as I was missing a more melodic production here to make the song stand out enough for me. So not all the way this time.  

I appreciate the songwriting, but I wasn't into the final mix of Fearless nor the vocal performance.  

what we didn't enjoy here is unoriginal melodies, keep on, your voice is amazing  

not a fan of the drop here but just my taste  

Thanks for submitting but I'm going to pass. The song has solid production that sets a nice tone but vocally I feel the song could be stronger to my personal ear. Best of luck to you  

Congrats on the single. Lovely dance. That ending wasn't what the beginning of the song was teasing. Was hoping for a huge ending. But that's just us FT. Nice house, indeed. Keep on kickin' as you do. Sorry couldn't pull the trigger. Enjoy the accolades.

La chanson sonne très ordinaire, standard selon nous, peut être une autre  

I struggled a bit to stay dialed in on the vocals enough to connect lyrically. The build and production are there, but I never found my one moment to land with this one.  

**My final thought**

As you can see the most complain is the drop that isn’t huge, and surprise surprise, this is what i wanted, i don’t wanna copy niky romero or other artists, i wanna share my personal vibes, and when i listen a song i’m looking for a contact with the artist, trying to feel what he felt, i'm not trying to think about what he was supposed to do, the song is his world and if he made a different choice there is a reason, and as listener i try to understand it.  

Music is art, or it should be, i just immagine someone like Picasso in our era where a curators will write “Sorry but i’m not  expected something less messy, try to paint like Raffaello”

Surely might circle back around to this one though after giving it some time and will reach out..!   Production is really dope here. Vocals need a little development, sonically fell a little short for us. Keep it up though, production is dope   The intro got me hooked! The drop was however very underwhelming. I'd try adding a lead to it so it can shine!   Good production. The track feels, however, a little on the familiar side and might benefit from adding fresher sound elements, twists and turns to really take off and stand out that much more in this genre.   Great tune, loved the vocal as well as the bubbling house vibes on the baseline. The drop is quite fresh and well produced and overall the track sounds really fresh. Unfortunately, it's a bit too relaxing and deep for us, sorry   The highs of this song sound a little bit strange. Would work on that to get a proper final track because the melody has a really good potential!   La chanson sonne très ordinaire, standard selon nous, peut être une autre   I struggled a bit to stay dialed in on the vocals enough to connect lyrically. The build and production are there, but I never found my one moment to land with this one.   **My final thought** As you can see the most complain is the drop that isn’t huge, and surprise surprise, this is what i wanted, i don’t wanna copy niky romero or other artists, i wanna share my personal vibes, and when i listen a song i’m looking for a contact with the artist, trying to feel what he felt, i'm not trying to think about what he was supposed to do, the song is his world and if he made a different choice there is a reason, and as listener i try to understand it.   Music is art, or it should be, i just immagine someone like Picasso in our era where a curators will write “Sorry but i’m not  expected something less messy, try to paint like Raffaello” I can’t post links, but if someone is curious to listen the song send me a DM i will drop you the link I’m also running a campaign on playlistpush, if this topic will reach some interest i will post my thought on that service too"

While submit hub is a lot better with having a low minimum starting price it can also get quite expensive really fast. The only guarantee on both services being a review from an independent curator.

The current popular submission services can also take a relatively long time to have all curators respond.

gmvoxd,1589917359.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,[deleted],"My experiences with paid promotion so far (submithub, playlistpush, facebook)","**If you're lazy, just read the TL:DR section.** So I recently pushed a track hard for the first time, spending quite a bit of money on it. Thought I'd share my experience so far with these popular platforms. Please note these are my opinions and not facts; platforms are also changing over time, for example both submithub &amp; playlistpush has changed quite a bit since they started (both of them seem to be getting better). This is of May 2020.

.

**Facebook ads (with Spotify link):**

Very difficult to get any streams this way. Facebook is good if you want to reach out with information (ie, ""I'm playing live this summer!"") but not for getting streams. Also, you MUST be very specific about your target audience. The FB algorithms seemingly show your ad primarily to people who usually randomly like &amp; click stuff. This is probably not what you want... a 30 sec preview clip with Spotify API will also not count as a stream. I tried several campains over a few weeks to different countries &amp; target audiences, and my conclusion is that it's a tricky platform to use to get Spotify streams specifically.

.

**TL:DR: Facebook ads are good for specific things (reaching out with information), but very expensive if you count it per stream with a Spotify link. I've had better results with YouTube videos in the past though; unfortunately a shiny Spotify preview 30 sec clip will not count as a stream.**

.

**Submithub:**

While the authors claim to be taking playlist curators seriously and having quality control, this is simply not  true. I've seen banned Spotify playlists that, even a week later, still remained on Submithub &amp; people sending +20 daily premium submissions. (Ie, someone makes money to listen to music and their fake bot playlist doesn't even exist anymore...) If you look at these curators including ""really good bloggers"" as they call them, some have an FB account with +100k likes but almost no likes or interaction on posts. I'd say too many of curators on submithub are shady in the sense that it's not useful to you as an artist to get reposted to bot playlist &amp; some random ""big"" influencer that has a bunch of fake likes/streams or they brag with a +1 million subs youtube channel, but there's only famous artists on there (you won't get reposted there). Or a big Spotify playlist but you'll never end up on the good ones, just their ""dumpster"" playlist for reposts from Submithub so their stats will look good &amp; they can keep making money by ""listening"" to people's music.

.

**TL:DR:** **While the above sounded very negative, Submithub is decent if you do your research. Just be aware that it takes a LOT of time and effort to find out the good curators (don't be fooled by shiny stats; you have to dig deep). After you use the service, I recommend creating a list of curators were your sort out good ones and also a blacklist (yes, a blacklist). You do NOT want to end up on fake playlists; make sure to post to curators with a high premium following on Spotify.**

.

**Playlist Push:**

I was sceptical because of the combo of lack of settings when you submit a song &amp; the price you pay, everything is pretty much automated. What happens now? I like to have more control. Well, I was  pleased to find that all curators you get posted to write (often quite extensive) reviews of your song that clearly show they've listened to the song (regardless if they accept/reject). I also saw a curator that got banned during my campaign because he didn't live up to the quality standards, so that was a nice touch, they seemingly work actively to maintain serious curators. I got several reposts from here to big playlists with +100k followers and most of them seem to be the real deal (even though you'll likely end up far down in the playlists themselves, just the big artists at the top; altough I did end up on 9th place on a very big playlist among world-famous artists, woohoo!)

.

**TL:DR: Overall, I'm impressed with the Playlist Push experience and this will likely be my go-to promotion service for upcoming songs. Hopefully they will introduce more filters in the future, but you will get REAL curators and playlists to look at your song; they work activly to sort out the BS. (And no, I don't work for them).**

So I've just released a new track as part of my ambient project. I normally use Submithub and use the premium credits; I've had a good response rate (about 20 submissions and 6/7 accepted), managed to get on some biggish playlists, around 3k, or 4k followers.

Anyway, I'm looking for new sites to push to playlists? I tried PlaylistPush (I don't want to spend $300+)! But, then I found a few sites like SoundPlate that ask you to follow certain people and playlists for a free submission.  


But! They ask for a huge access into your spotify? This feels very uncomfortable to me. But its asking for:

* Create, edit, and follow playlists                     
* Manage who you follow on Spotify

Playlist Push requires hundreds of dollars and you don’t get to see who you submit to until after you spend your money. It’s a huge gamble. You could find out after they take your money that half the playlists weren’t even a good fit in the first place 

Submithub lets you do research beforehand which is cool but they pay less. It’s a lot of work to be a quality curator/influencer and they deserve to get paid. It’s better for promoters to be somewhere like PlaylistPush because they get paid more, but this hurts artists 

If submithub raised its prices it would attract more quality promoters and we as artists could make more educated decisions. We also wouldn’t waste as much money.

Something’s gotta change because music promo is too expensive. You either have to be a TikTok fiend and post 5x a day or you have to spend 500$+ on mystery playlist promo and get ripped off. Or run ads but that’s also expensive and has a high learning curve

These mystery box playlist companies like PlayListPush have got to go, or be more transparent. And submithub should do a better job of amassing quality. I imagine that means increasing their prices a bit. The max is 4 credits? Folks on PlaylistPush can make like 10$ per submission.

Hope you doin well. I'm independent musician for more than 7 years. You already know how it's such a trouble to promote your own music as independent musicians. I had this problem as well but this issue really start to get so much annoying for me. In deep Im about to give it up.

Let me write you which Spotify promotion &amp; marketing methods I've tried so far.

1- Google ads - Obviously useless for musician

2- Ig Ads - Better than google but not effective again

3- Playlist Promotion website: Like soundcampaign, playlist push I almost spend more than 1.000 dolar on that website. Yeahh they put your song some organic playlist but maybe we gain about 10k stream totally. 1.000 dolar for 1.000 stream this is insane as I said. These are nice websites but for price and gain really I don't think people can work with these website more than 1

4- Tiktok influencer: Full of bot. For my last release I worked with 10 micro-influencer total 10m people watch these video but thats all! Even not small move to stream

5- Purchase Bot Streams: All musicians &amp; independent record labels around me talk about [Spotifypanel.com](https://Spotifypanel.com) for last 1 years which they always use their bot stream services to boost their spotify streams. As I know or heard lots of biggest world start using their services as well. We all know that these was not the solution in the long term or can hurt our profile. I make some try about 10 dolar. believe me or not but these plays has better outcome for me when I compare to other costly way. But This is just 10 dolar order Im'm not sure that you can build all your career on bot plays.

Shortly I need your advise guys :) Really gladly appreciate all your advice.

12ncu9s,1681581529.0,Songwriting,Big-Association-239,I recommend Yougrow for playlist promotion,"So i just wanted to share with the crowd the good experience I had with a service called Yougrow for promotion. Lest you think I am just a shill, I also share my bad experiences, such as this post from several months ago about how playlist push is terrible (An opinion I still stand by) [https://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriting/comments/veeuse/comment/j2vsw8i/?%2524](https://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriting/comments/veeuse/comment/j2vsw8i/?%2524)

Prior to using yougrow, I used the aforementioned playlist push as well as submithub and groover. The problem with all 3 is they make you go through and pitch yourself to the playlists, and many of their playlists are terrible. So I get so many responses with them from playlisters saying ""your song is great, but doesn't fit my style"" Then why did your algorithms recommend this person to me? And many of the playlists I have got from those services were worthless and gave me a couple dozen streams. And if you're wondering why I particularly think playlist push is a scam and not submithub or groover, it's because of price. The latter 2 charge you a buck or two per send, so not a big deal if you strike out. PP charges hundreds, or thousands depending on the package, and gives you no guarantee you'll get on any playlist. 

Someone actually on here recommended yougrow to me, and it's worked great. For one, after you pay them THEY pitch your song to playlists they think it is a fit for. And you get your money back if they can't get it placed. So I chose their ""starter"" package which was like 67 bucks for 2-6k guaranteed streams. The playlist they got my song on had more than 225,000 likes (or saves or whatever they are) and the song so far has got 25k streams and counting, obviously way more than even what was promised. The song also got a lot of saves which has helped with the spotify algorithms, and I've obtained 135 new followers. In spotify streaming revenue, I've already made back like half my 67 dollar investment. 

Now, one thing I can't vouch for is their higher priced options. For example, if you choose the yougrow ""superstar"" option  for $1200 will you start getting millions of streams? I don't know. But the starter package has worked extremely well for me",1.0,1.0,0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Songwriting/comments/12ncu9s/i_recommend_yougrow_for_playlist_promotion/,I recommend Yougrow for playlist promotion,i recommend yougrow for playlist promotion,"So i just wanted to share with the crowd the good experience I had with a service called Yougrow for promotion.

And many of the playlists I have got from those services were worthless and gave me a couple dozen streams. And if you're wondering why I particularly think playlist push is a scam and not submithub or groover, it's because of price. The latter 2 charge you a buck or two per send, so not a big deal if you strike out. PP charges hundreds, or thousands depending on the package, and gives you no guarantee you'll get on any playlist.  Someone actually on here recommended yougrow to me, and it's worked great. For one, after you pay them THEY pitch your song to playlists they think it is a fit for. And you get your money back if they can't get it placed. So I chose their ""starter"" package which was like 67 bucks for 2-6k guaranteed streams. The playlist they got my song on had more than 225,000 likes (or saves or whatever they are) and the song so far has got 25k streams and counting, obviously way more than even what was promised. The song also got a lot of saves which has helped with the spotify algorithms, and I've obtained 135 new followers. In spotify streaming revenue, I've already made back like half my 67 dollar investment.  Now, one thing I can't vouch for is their higher priced options. For example, if you choose the yougrow ""superstar"" option  for $1200 will you start getting millions of streams? I don't know.
