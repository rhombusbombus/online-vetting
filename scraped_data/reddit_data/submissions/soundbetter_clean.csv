I have tried to expand my reach with platforms such as SoundBetter, but it seems they are catering to either huge name profiles and make it virtually impossible for producers like myself. 

I’ve been producing music now for over 7 years, and also perform professionally for over 10 years. I have worked with a wide variety of genres, such as pop, alternative, punk, country, rock, and more, and am always open to expanding my range of genres!

I have produced and mixed the entire catalog for artists such as Jaelyn Kay, The Beach Bums (just to name a couple).

I always strive to get the best sounding mix for the song, and I put my full effort into making each song hit the way the artist wants.

If you are interested, please send me a pm with your info! I’d love to work with you!

I’m trying to use online platforms to get more clients as a mixing engineer for more than one year now, with not much success.
I ended up mixing a few bands on Fiverr but just got one customer on SoundBetter.

1apeqio,1707781224.0,audioengineering,KevinDurantsDurag,Navigating the mixing market as an artist?,"So I recently recorded one of my tracks at one of the top studios in my city. Everything went great, but mixing from my engineer would’ve cost me upwards of $800. I communicate with the studio still for mastering though. Even with working with my budget I wouldn’t be able to afford the mixing . I went through soundbetter, engineears, fiverr to find a mixing engineer all in the 100-250 price range. I’d have to say my experiences were all bad except for one.  Below is a long story that explains  my inexperience and horrible money management. But my main questions: is a budget of $500-$600 good for finding a pro mixing engineer? And how do you guys navigate to finding good engineers.?

For the 4 main examples.
Cheapest engineer at $115: he actually did pretty well, but there was a major problem in the mix that was really integral. Tried to explain  but either he disagreed with my idea or didn’t know how to change it. I talked with the same mastering engineers at the studio about it and they understood the problem and had suggestions I could communicate but nothing worked out with the engineer. For the price it’s a great mix though. 

The others included passionate amateurs and assistant engineers at studios, and those were much worse. Even though they were all very communicative, the end products they gave me were all not much different than just turning up the volumes . One engineer turned the vocals into a distorted/crunchy radio voice (was not in any request or revision ask). Another (according to the website) accepted my mix files, then dropped the mix back to me 30 minutes later. I’m not saying there aren’t people who can mix fast but cmon.

And I’m Not saying that these engineers were bad, just that I feel like it was nowhere near what I’d even hope. Maybe they were crunched for time. Maybe they just thought my song was shit. Or maybe they thought everything in the sound was fine on their end. Nor am I saying I know more than the engineers. But Maybe I was just the singular bad experience considering all their five star reviews? (I know some can be bought but don’t want to accuse)

Add: like I said I don’t think I know more than these engineers. But I took a knack at mxiing for a year and didn’t enjoy it, but it got a basic understanding of certain things as to help me when communicating with engineers and understanding song changes, so I’m not completely clueless on that end.

But I’m now scared of just throwing money at someone hoping it sticks, especially when I’ve read of high cost engineers who hand their work over to another person, etc. but again that can just be fear play. But I just realized that maybe instead of paying multiple cheaper less experienced engineers and keep trying, I can hopefully pay a more experienced one that total cost and save all the hassle.",1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/1apeqio/navigating_the_mixing_market_as_an_artist/,Navigating the mixing market as an artist?,navigating the mixing market as an artist?,"So I recently recorded one of my tracks at one of the top studios in my city.

I just don't know if I want to sink in the money on a studio, which can hire session musicians and engineer, etc. Or maybe using Soundbetter is a good middle ground.

#Picks Of The Week (by u/lefuniname)

I've always been a big fan of what's coming out of the **NoCopyrightSounds** camp, not just for the sheer quality of the free music, but also for their eye for new talent. I can't speak for other genres of course, but just in DnB they've been responsible for pushing early tunes by _Andromedik_, _V O E_, _More Plastic_, _Wiguez_ and _Cream Blade_, and that's just the ones that have been getting a lot of buzz in recent times! So, to celebrate that and their recent, very much appreciated focus on DnB a bit, let's take a look at two wonderful examples from this week, starting with a proper veteran of the royalty-free spheres of drum and bass.

####**1. Itro - Never Let You Down [NCS]**  
*Recommended if you like: Andromedik, T &amp; Sugah, Fitch*  

That's right, it's finally time to talk about **Itro**! One of the surprisingly many, in my eyes, _(It)royally_ underrated artists that I have loved for _ages_ already, but apparently never managed to talk about on here. Well, that changes today! 

Born in Wijk Bij Duurstede, but nowadays based in the slightly easier to pronounce Amsterdam, it didn't take Dutchie Kelvin Rowaan very long to fall in love with all things music. During his early childhood, it was the electric guitar that brought him joy, but as soon as his brother showed him the sick beatz he created in _Fruity Loops_, little Kelvin jumped over to the electronic side. Through the power of YouTube tutorials, Kelvin got better and better, until the 16-year-old finally unleashed the first of many tunes as **Itro** in 2013. Right from the first release, the uplifting, pure happiness Nitro was fully engaged, and one hands-in-the-air EDM bop after the other fell out of him, some self-released, some distributed via _Outertone_. Especially his many early collaborations with _Tobu_ seem to have hit the Zeitgeist _just right_, with _Sunburst_ racking up 32 million (!!!) streams and _Cloud 9_ having cracked the 40 million mark (?!?!) by now. 

Of course, one of the reasons for this gargantuan amount of streams was **NoCopyrightSounds**! As one of the very first artists to sign to the freshly founded label of the blossoming promotional channel, Itro got such a massive boost in visibility that me calling him underrated is kind of ridiculous, but since our scene for some reason doesn't care about NCS releases all too often, it arguably still applies! Anyway. What followed was one EDM House hit after the other, which, according to these weird compilations on Spotify, ranged from ""Morning House"" and ""Study House"" all the way up to ""Turn It Up House"", but also some glittery Future Bass and starting with _Starbound_ even some proper DnB! Along with this delightful treasure (I)trove of releases, however, came another producer by the ominous name of _totally not itro_ that started taking the SoundCloud scene by storm, combining the melodicality of Itro with stuff like Trap or ""trying to be porter robinson"" and ""fucking wasps"" type beats. 

Unsolvable mysteries aside though, the next couple years saw Kelvin more and more break into our usual spheres here, thanks to his mates _Polygon_ sending their remix of his tune _Light and Blue_ to _Justin Hawkes'_ feedback streams in 2016, who then promptly sent it to _Liquicity_, putting both Polygon and Itro on the map of the Dutch DnBehemoth. Around one and a half years later, Itro finally made his label debut there, on _Galaxy Of Dreams 3_, quickly followed by his collaborative _Harmony_ EP with his good friends _Andromedik_ and the aforementioned multifaceted boys. Fun fact: Since 2020 he's also part of the **LiftOff** agency alongside _Carrier_, _Enthropix_ and said now-single-faced geometric shape! 

While most of the DnB Itroutput from 2018 on found a safe home on _Liquicity_, the rest of his diverse genre explorations were mostly being released on his own, just as they had been since 2016 or so, with the exception of his two _Ninety9Lives_ singles. Sure, he's always been a name closely associated with the N-to-the-C-to-the-S brand, but it actually took 8 whole years, in other words until 2023 (!), for Itro to make his triumphant return to the label that started it all for him, with the bouncy _All For You_! Luckily, the gap between releases wasn't quite as significant this time around, and just a couple months later we are so _back_, with **Never Let You Down**. 

As many of you should know by now, I'm a total sucker for a catchy vocal hook, and Itro has never been one to, well, _let me down_ in that regard, but with Nashville-based **Drew Tyler** he has truly struck gold in my opinion. _Never Let You Down_'s upbeat trichotomic guitar-piano-drum intro, which only becomes more Indie Pop over time with the classic _clap your hands together_ moment, is _perfectly_ complemented by Drew's silky soft, satisfyingly multi-layered, simply fantastic performance, putting a big smile on my face before we even get to the drop. I can see why they gave each other 5 stars on _SoundBetter_. Speaking of the drop though: In true Itro fashion, it's equal parts uplifting, anthemic and heartwarming, thanks to the one-two-punch of an impossibly infectious, super fun synth lead melody and wonderfully warm bass. Fun fact: The first version of this drop goes back all the way to 2020, with at least 3 other versions of this same drop existing on his hard drive. Amazing things take time and all that. 

It's great to see that Itro has taken Rick Astley's advice to heart, continuing his streak of not disappointing me in the slightest. Simply lovely!

####**2. KEELA - SUN 💎 [NCS]**  
*Recommended if you like: Not Fair, Howlan, The Outsiders*  

Now, for someone who celebrated their _debut_ release on NCS this week: **KEELA**! 

Back in September of last year, when I talked about _Not Fair_'s absolutely wild debut, I briefly mentioned the most excellent community that's been building around _Tom Finster_'s and _barking continues_' weekly **WeAreHumans** streams. Every Wednesday evening, one of them will go live on Twitch and either give feedback to the community's ever-improving demo submissions, do a little sample flip challenge or just take a bath and drink some Bierle for a bit. It's great fun! As already alluded to, the submissions have been reaching simply ridiculous levels over the past few months, with basically no further feedback even being needed anymore, and fortunately, that means some of these mindbendingly sick compositions are finally, actually coming out! Trust me, it won't be the last time I'm referring to the _WAH_ gang on here these next few months. 

Anyway! Among this honestly simply astonishing assortment of talents, **Nico Heinsen** somehow still manages to stand tall as one of the most consistently insane producers, which is why he is this week's _Hidden Gem Of The Week™️_! After having gotten his start into this Bass music mess by producing Dubstep type tunes as **Fakefriend** around the turn of the decade, the now 22-to-24-year-old _(I don't know his exact birthday alright)_ started wanting to branch out from his roots a little bit. His first few demo submissions to the WeAreHumans streams date back as far as 2021, when he would still oscillate between _Fakefriend_ demos and his newest project _Kooma_, but soon enough, the former was abandoned in favour of the latter. Well, until he rebranded again to _KEELA_ a few years later. However, while the _DnB_ was already part of his social handles and thus definitely a main focus, he was still stretching out his feelers (keelers) across the entire bass music spectrum all this time, working through a total of 69 (nice) ideas until he finally arrived at one that worked for him.

That 70th idea? Well, that one became **SUN**! Thanks to encouraging words from _Bishu_ and _Not Fair_, a bunch of helpful advice from both the _WAH_ crew and _IMANU_, and some first release experiences with his bootlegs of _IMANU_'s _Drowning_ and _Tisoki, San Holo, RUNN - Go_ with _Not Fair_, the German talent managed to push it so far over the finish line that it got picked up by, who could have guessed it, **NoCopyrightSounds**! I mean, who could fault them! After all, _SUN_ isn't just vibey as all hell, its powerful back-and-forth between straight-up weird synth bombs going off in your face one at a time and smaller, just-as-weird _(but in a different way)_ _(i have such a way with words)_ synths firing off in the most rapid of fashions is truly an auditory experience to behold. Seriously, those things are somehow distorted in such a way you didn't even know was possible, while still remaining clean as hell and melodically resonant?! As if that wasn't enough flexing for one release, he goes _all out_ for the outro, leaving you in a total state of shock at the sheer production talent at display here. 

An incredible cocktail of slick yet boundary-pushing production, with a dash of vibey vocals, all mixed down to perfection - also known as the _TeKEELA SUNrise_!

(week 05)","--- &nbsp; |             |      | |----------- |-----| |**Weekly updated Spotify Playlist**| **H2L New Drum & Bass** I've always been a big fan of what's coming out of the **NoCopyrightSounds** camp, not just for the sheer quality of the free music, but also for their eye for new talent. I can't speak for other genres of course, but just in DnB they've been responsible for pushing early tunes by _Andromedik_, _V O E_, _More Plastic_, _Wiguez_ and _Cream Blade_, and that's just the ones that have been getting a lot of buzz in recent times! So, to celebrate that and their recent, very much appreciated focus on DnB a bit, let's take a look at two wonderful examples from this week, starting with a proper veteran of the royalty-free spheres of drum and bass. **1. Itro - Never Let You Down NCS**   *Recommended if you like Andromedik, T & Sugah, Fitch*   That's right, it's finally time to talk about **Itro**! One of the surprisingly many, in my eyes, _(It)royally_ underrated artists that I have loved for _ages_ already, but apparently never managed to talk about on here. Well, that changes today!  Born in Wijk Bij Duurstede, but nowadays based in the slightly easier to pronounce Amsterdam, it didn't take Dutchie Kelvin Rowaan very long to fall in love with all things music. During his early childhood, it was the electric guitar that brought him joy, but as soon as his brother showed him the sick beatz he created in _Fruity Loops_, little Kelvin jumped over to the electronic side. Through the power of YouTube tutorials, Kelvin got better and better, until the 16-year-old finally unleashed the first of many tunes as **Itro** in 2013. Right from the first release, the uplifting, pure happiness Nitro was fully engaged, and one hands-in-the-air EDM bop after the other fell out of him, some self-released, some distributed via _Outertone_. Especially his many early collaborations with _Tobu_ seem to have hit the Zeitgeist _just right_, with _Sunburst_ racking up 32 million (!!!) streams and _Cloud 9_ having cracked the 40 million mark (?!?!) by now.  Of course, one of the reasons for this gargantuan amount of streams was **NoCopyrightSounds**! As one of the very first artists to sign to the freshly founded label of the blossoming promotional channel, Itro got such a massive boost in visibility that me calling him underrated is kind of ridiculous, but since our scene for some reason doesn't care about NCS releases all too often, it arguably still applies! Anyway. What followed was one EDM House hit after the other, which, according to these weird compilations on Spotify, ranged from ""Morning House"" and ""Study House"" all the way up to ""Turn It Up House"", but also some glittery Future Bass and starting with _Starbound_ even some proper DnB! Along with this delightful treasure (I)trove of releases, however, came another producer by the ominous name of _totally not itro_ that started taking the SoundCloud scene by storm, combining the melodicality of Itro with stuff like Trap or ""trying to be porter robinson"" and ""fucking wasps"" type beats.  Unsolvable mysteries aside though, the next couple years saw Kelvin more and more break into our usual spheres here, thanks to his mates _Polygon_ sending their remix of his tune _Light and Blue_ to _Justin Hawkes'_ feedback streams in 2016, who then promptly sent it to _Liquicity_, putting both Polygon and Itro on the map of the Dutch DnBehemoth. Around one and a half years later, Itro finally made his label debut there, on _Galaxy Of Dreams 3_, quickly followed by his collaborative _Harmony_ EP with his good friends _Andromedik_ and the aforementioned multifaceted boys. Fun fact Since 2020 he's also part of the **LiftOff** agency alongside _Carrier_, _Enthropix_ and said now-single-faced geometric shape!  While most of the DnB Itroutput from 2018 on found a safe home on _Liquicity_, the rest of his diverse genre explorations were mostly being released on his own, just as they had been since 2016 or so, with the exception of his two _Ninety9Lives_ singles. Sure, he's always been a name closely associated with the N-to-the-C-to-the-S brand, but it actually took 8 whole years, in other words until 2023 (!), for Itro to make his triumphant return to the label that started it all for him, with the bouncy _All For You_! Luckily, the gap between releases wasn't quite as significant this time around, and just a couple months later we are so _back_, with **Never Let You Down**.  As many of you should know by now, I'm a total sucker for a catchy vocal hook, and Itro has never been one to, well, _let me down_ in that regard, but with Nashville-based **Drew Tyler** he has truly struck gold in my opinion. _Never Let You Down_'s upbeat trichotomic guitar-piano-drum intro, which only becomes more Indie Pop over time with the classic _clap your hands together_ moment, is _perfectly_ complemented by Drew's silky soft, satisfyingly multi-layered, simply fantastic performance, putting a big smile on my face before we even get to the drop. I can see why they gave each other 5 stars on _SoundBetter_. Speaking of the drop though In true Itro fashion, it's equal parts uplifting, anthemic and heartwarming, thanks to the one-two-punch of an impossibly infectious, super fun synth lead melody and wonderfully warm bass. Fun fact The first version of this drop goes back all the way to 2020, with at least 3 other versions of this same drop existing on his hard drive. Amazing things take time and all that.  It's great to see that Itro has taken Rick Astley's advice to heart, continuing his streak of not disappointing me in the slightest. Simply lovely! Other Dancefloor goodness from this week   Various Artists - Deadbeats & Brownies LP   Mason, Princess Superstar - Perfect (Exceeder) (1991 Remix)   Murdock - X-Ray LP   T & Sugah - Imma Give   Samstone, Aktive - My Favourite Game (feat. The Cardigans)   -- **2. KEELA - SUN  NCS**   *Recommended if you like Not Fair, Howlan, The Outsiders*   Now, for someone who celebrated their _debut_ release on NCS this week **KEELA**!  Back in September of last year, when I talked about _Not Fair_'s absolutely wild debut, I briefly mentioned the most excellent community that's been building around _Tom Finster_'s and _barking continues_' weekly **WeAreHumans** streams. Every Wednesday evening, one of them will go live on Twitch and either give feedback to the community's ever-improving demo submissions, do a little sample flip challenge or just take a bath and drink some Bierle for a bit. It's great fun! As already alluded to, the submissions have been reaching simply ridiculous levels over the past few months, with basically no further feedback even being needed anymore, and fortunately, that means some of these mindbendingly sick compositions are finally, actually coming out! Trust me, it won't be the last time I'm referring to the _WAH_ gang on here these next few months.  Anyway! Among this honestly simply astonishing assortment of talents, **Nico Heinsen** somehow still manages to stand tall as one of the most consistently insane producers, which is why he is this week's _Hidden Gem Of The Week™_! After having gotten his start into this Bass music mess by producing Dubstep type tunes as **Fakefriend** around the turn of the decade, the now 22-to-24-year-old _(I don't know his exact birthday alright)_ started wanting to branch out from his roots a little bit. His first few demo submissions to the WeAreHumans streams date back as far as 2021, when he would still oscillate between _Fakefriend_ demos and his newest project _Kooma_, but soon enough, the former was abandoned in favour of the latter. Well, until he rebranded again to _KEELA_ a few years later. However, while the _DnB_ was already part of his social handles and thus definitely a main focus, he was still stretching out his feelers (keelers) across the entire bass music spectrum all this time, working through a total of 69 (nice) ideas until he finally arrived at one that worked for him. That 70th idea? Well, that one became **SUN**! Thanks to encouraging words from _Bishu_ and _Not Fair_, a bunch of helpful advice from both the _WAH_ crew and _IMANU_, and some first release experiences with his bootlegs of _IMANU_'s _Drowning_ and _Tisoki, San Holo, RUNN - Go_ with _Not Fair_, the German talent managed to push it so far over the finish line that it got picked up by, who could have guessed it, **NoCopyrightSounds**! I mean, who could fault them! After all, _SUN_ isn't just vibey as all hell, its powerful back-and-forth between straight-up weird synth bombs going off in your face one at a time and smaller, just-as-weird _(but in a different way)_ _(i have such a way with words)_ synths firing off in the most rapid of fashions is truly an auditory experience to behold. Seriously, those things are somehow distorted in such a way you didn't even know was possible, while still remaining clean as hell and melodically resonant?! As if that wasn't enough flexing for one release, he goes _all out_ for the outro, leaving you in a total state of shock at the sheer production talent at display here.  An incredible cocktail of slick yet boundary-pushing production, with a dash of vibey vocals, all mixed down to perfection - also known as the _TeKEELA SUNrise_!

never let you down ncs**   *recommended if you like andromedik, t & sugah, fitch*   that's right, it's finally time to talk about **itro**! one of the surprisingly many, in my eyes, _(it)royally_ underrated artists that i have loved for _ages_ already, but apparently never managed to talk about on here. well, that changes today!  born in wijk bij duurstede, but nowadays based in the slightly easier to pronounce amsterdam, it didn't take dutchie kelvin rowaan very long to fall in love with all things music. during his early childhood, it was the electric guitar that brought him joy, but as soon as his brother showed him the sick beatz he created in _fruity loops_, little kelvin jumped over to the electronic side. through the power of youtube tutorials, kelvin got better and better, until the 16-year-old finally unleashed the first of many tunes as **itro** in 2013. right from the first release, the uplifting, pure happiness nitro was fully engaged, and one hands-in-the-air edm bop after the other fell out of him, some self-released, some distributed via _outertone_. especially his many early collaborations with _tobu_ seem to have hit the zeitgeist _just right_, with _sunburst_ racking up 32 million (!!!) streams and _cloud 9_ having cracked the 40 million mark (?!?!) by now.  of course, one of the reasons for this gargantuan amount of streams was **nocopyrightsounds**! as one of the very first artists to sign to the freshly founded label of the blossoming promotional channel, itro got such a massive boost in visibility that me calling him underrated is kind of ridiculous, but since our scene for some reason doesn't care about ncs releases all too often, it arguably still applies! anyway. what followed was one edm house hit after the other, which, according to these weird compilations on spotify, ranged from ""morning house"" and ""study house"" all the way up to ""turn it up house"", but also some glittery future bass and starting with _starbound_ even some proper dnb! along with this delightful treasure (i)trove of releases, however, came another producer by the ominous name of _totally not itro_ that started taking the soundcloud scene by storm, combining the melodicality of itro with stuff like trap or ""trying to be porter robinson"" and ""fucking wasps"" type beats.  unsolvable mysteries aside though, the next couple years saw kelvin more and more break into our usual spheres here, thanks to his mates _polygon_ sending their remix of his tune _light and blue_ to _justin hawkes'_ feedback streams in 2016, who then promptly sent it to _liquicity_, putting both polygon and itro on the map of the dutch dnbehemoth. around one and a half years later, itro finally made his label debut there, on _galaxy of dreams 3_, quickly followed by his collaborative _harmony_ ep with his good friends _andromedik_ and the aforementioned multifaceted boys. fun fact since 2020 he's also part of the **liftoff** agency alongside _carrier_, _enthropix_ and said now-single-faced geometric shape!  while most of the dnb itroutput from 2018 on found a safe home on _liquicity_, the rest of his diverse genre explorations were mostly being released on his own, just as they had been since 2016 or so, with the exception of his two _ninety9lives_ singles. sure, he's always been a name closely associated with the n-to-the-c-to-the-s brand, but it actually took 8 whole years, in other words until 2023 (!), for itro to make his triumphant return to the label that started it all for him, with the bouncy _all for you_! luckily, the gap between releases wasn't quite as significant this time around, and just a couple months later we are so _back_, with **never let you down**.  as many of you should know by now, i'm a total sucker for a catchy vocal hook, and itro has never been one to, well, _let me down_ in that regard, but with nashville-based **drew tyler** he has truly struck gold in my opinion. _never let you down_'s upbeat trichotomic guitar-piano-drum intro, which only becomes more indie pop over time with the classic _clap your hands together_ moment, is _perfectly_ complemented by drew's silky soft, satisfyingly multi-layered, simply fantastic performance, putting a big smile on my face before we even get to the drop. i can see why they gave each other 5 stars on _soundbetter_. speaking of the drop though in true itro fashion, it's equal parts uplifting, anthemic and heartwarming, thanks to the one-two-punch of an impossibly infectious, super fun synth lead melody and wonderfully warm bass. fun fact the first version of this drop goes back all the way to 2020, with at least 3 other versions of this same drop existing on his hard drive. amazing things take time and all that.  it's great to see that itro has taken rick astley's advice to heart, continuing his streak of not disappointing me in the slightest. simply lovely! other dancefloor goodness from this week   various artists -

sun  ncs**   *recommended if you like not fair, howlan, the outsiders*   now, for someone who celebrated their _debut_ release on ncs this week **keela**!  back in september of last year, when i talked about _not fair_'s absolutely wild debut, i briefly mentioned the most excellent community that's been building around _tom finster_'s and _barking continues_' weekly **wearehumans** streams. every wednesday evening, one of them will go live on twitch and either give feedback to the community's ever-improving demo submissions, do a little sample flip challenge or just take a bath and drink some bierle for a bit. it's great fun! as already alluded to, the submissions have been reaching simply ridiculous levels over the past few months, with basically no further feedback even being needed anymore, and fortunately, that means some of these mindbendingly sick compositions are finally, actually coming out! trust me, it won't be the last time i'm referring to the _wah_ gang on here these next few months.  anyway! among this honestly simply astonishing assortment of talents, **nico heinsen** somehow still manages to stand tall as one of the most consistently insane producers, which is why he is this week's _hidden gem of the week™_! after having gotten his start into this bass music mess by producing dubstep type tunes as **fakefriend** around the turn of the decade, the now 22-to-24-year-old _(i don't know his exact birthday alright)_ started wanting to branch out from his roots a little bit. his first few demo submissions to the wearehumans streams date back as far as 2021, when he would still oscillate between _fakefriend_ demos and his newest project _kooma_, but soon enough, the former was abandoned in favour of the latter. well, until he rebranded again to _keela_ a few years later. however, while the _dnb_ was already part of his social handles and thus definitely a main focus, he was still stretching out his feelers (keelers) across the entire bass music spectrum all this time, working through a total of 69 (nice) ideas until he finally arrived at one that worked for him. that 70th idea? well, that one became **sun**! thanks to encouraging words from _bishu_ and _not fair_, a bunch of helpful advice from both the _wah_ crew and _imanu_, and some first release experiences with his bootlegs of _imanu_'s _drowning_ and _tisoki, san holo, runn -

19azi2k,1705713196.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,Jonography,Have any of you used session musicians to record certain instruments as a song writer? How did you find them and how did it go?,"I’m in my late 30s. Played bass and a little guitar in bands for around 10years in my teens and 20s. The last time I played in a group was over a decade ago but I’ve continued to play music and write for myself.

Over the past few months I’ve been learning more about recording at home and I’m really enjoying the process. My trials have made me think I might be able to record something pretty decent that could actually be album-worthy. 

Progress is slow but maybe in a few months I can have 2-4 songs down and ready to mix. However I often think that I’d love to say, have another singer do backing tracks, another doing some upright bass, violins etc.

Have any of you been in that position and ended up hiring or sourcing other musicians simply to take the ideas in your head and accompany the song you’ve written?

How did you go about it and what was the experience like?

I figured I might be able to find people willing to do it for free simply for enjoyment. However I’ve also considered paying somebody local, or hiring somebody on the website “SoundBetter” or some equivalent to meet at a studio just to record particular parts I want.

It seems illogical maybe, but for some reason I feel a bit hesitant about it as I never work with other musicians and it somewhat feels intimidating.",1,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/19azi2k/have_any_of_you_used_session_musicians_to_record/,Have any of you used session musicians to record certain instruments as a song writer?

I use Instagram Ads, Facebook Ads, and playlist pitching (SubmitHub and Groover). I have grown my IG from 500 to over 3k.

Initially, I really liked Groover, mostly because it has a HUGE curator base. But after using Groover for over 1 year, I am finally convinced that 90% of the curators on this site are just trying to get paid. Why do I say this?

Keep in mind that this song is a Pop Ballad with a Rap in Verse 2. So it's a Pop/Rap song with like a Marshmello type beat.

It is a sad song about how hard it is to let someone go with a very catchy hook, and again professionally mixed, mastered, lined up, and produced.

I have already spent THOUSANDS of dollars on this website, and yet I get WAY better exposure just running my own ads.","let me start by saying that i am a pop artist that has been focused on growing an organic fan base over the last year. i have been releasing 1 new song every 5 weeks so that i am always pushing out content and feeding the spotify algorithm. with each new release, i promote the song for 5 weeks. i use instagram ads, facebook ads, and playlist pitching (submithub and groover). i have grown my ig from 500 to over 3k. i average at least 10k monthly listeners on spotify and have over 200k total streams across 12 releases. i am even starting to grow at a steady pace on apple music just off of my ads campaign. so i'm not huge or anything, but i would consider myself as starting to become established. my music has high quality mixing, high quality production (i hire a professional producer on soundbetter), and is professionally mastered. so, naturally, my music has a professional feel to it and it is something i'm proud of. so why then, does groover troll me? let me explain.  initially, i really liked groover, mostly because it has a huge curator base. but after using groover for over 1 year, i am finally convinced that 90% of the curators on this site are just trying to get paid. why do i say this? because, although my music sounds ""professional and on par with the industry standard,"" my song is almost never added to playlists on groover. let me show you some screenshots &x200b; keep in mind that this song is a pop ballad with a rap in verse 2. so it's a pop/rap song with like a marshmello type beat. it sounds very similar to something juice wrld, the kid laroi, jb, post malone or halsey might put out. it is a sad song about how hard it is to let someone go with a very catchy hook, and again professionally mixed, mastered, lined up, and produced. all of these curators proceed to tell me the exact same thing. then tell me that it's not a fit for their playlist. i go to their playlist and guess who's on their playlists. juice wrld, post, kid, jb, etc. it's honestly all a load of crap. ""your song is amazing, well produced, sounds professional, but we aren't gonna add it. thanks send us your next track."" this has been my experience with groover for the last year. so for those of you out there who are trying to get your music out there, just be very careful here. in my opinion, the owner of the site needs to clean this up. i have already spent thousands of dollars on this website, and yet i get way better exposure just running my own ads.",4,463

Collaborations in the music industry can be a game-changer. They can introduce your music to new audiences and spark creative magic. But how do you find the best artists to collaborate with? Here are some tips to help you connect with the right musical partners.

**1. Define Your Collaboration Goals:**

Before you start your search, it's essential to clarify your collaboration goals. Are you looking to experiment with a different genre? Do you want to tap into a specific audience? Are you seeking to learn and grow as an artist? Knowing what you want will guide your search.

**2. Attend Local Gigs and Shows:**

If you're looking for local talent to collaborate with, attending gigs and shows in your area is a fantastic way to discover emerging artists. It's also a great opportunity to network and chat with musicians after their performances.

**3. Use Social Media and Online Platforms:**

Platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and SoundCloud are treasure troves of undiscovered talent. You can search for hashtags related to your music style, follow artists you admire, and engage with their content. Don't hesitate to send a direct message or comment on their work to express your interest in collaborating.

**4. Collaborative Music Platforms:**

Websites and apps like SoundBetter, Vocalizr, and Kompoz are designed to connect musicians for collaborations. These platforms allow you to browse profiles and find artists whose style aligns with yours.

**5. Attend Music Workshops and Classes:**

Enrolling in music workshops or classes in your area can help you meet like-minded musicians and potential collaborators. It's also an excellent way to enhance your skills and expand your network.

**6. Leverage Your Existing Network:**

Reach out to your current contacts in the music industry. Your producer, manager, or fellow band members may know of artists looking for collaborations. Personal recommendations often lead to fruitful partnerships.

**7. Collaborate Online:**

The digital age has made it easier than ever to collaborate with artists from around the world. You can use platforms like Splice, Dropbox, or Google Drive to share music files and collaborate remotely.

**8. Attend Music Conferences and Festivals:**

Music industry events, conferences, and festivals are hotspots for networking. They attract musicians, producers, and industry professionals from all over the world. Make the most of these opportunities to connect with potential collaborators.

**9. Join Facebook and Reddit Groups:**

Many Facebook groups and Reddit communities are dedicated to connecting musicians for collaborations. These platforms have dedicated sections where you can post about your project and find interested artists.

**Bonus: You Can Use Services Like** [Spotify Panel](https://spotifypanel.com/)**:**

Visit Spotify Panel and get yourself music based on music categories from Spotify, as SpotifyPanel provides the best services. It also offers premium, organic Spotify streaming services at affordable prices with safe, quick delivery. With the help of the above information, you will understand how you should buy Spotify place and whether it is worth it.

161efzi,1693005255.0,mixingmastering,JcTheWiz,Time and standards for Mixing in a pro studio?,"So I think I’m finally ready to visit a pro studio. I’ve been recording in my friends makeshift studio for a little while. After recording I’d just send to an engineer on sites like soundbetter. But I think the quality of the raw vocals have limited the potential of my songs, and my friends agrees. The upper limit for my budget is 80$-100$ per hour, with 100$ being absolute max if I was just completely wowed by a studio (I know price isn’t everything, but I know you get what you pay for). Because most studios seem to have a “contact for pricing” situation, I have no idea at what price Is “pro” pricing.

What I’m confused about mostly is mixing in a pro studio. 

1. Does mixing happen during booked time? For example, if I book 4 hours, and I finish tracking in 1 hour, can I dedicate the next 3 hours to mixing? And is the mix a separate price from what I paid to book the hours? Or is booking pretty much a “full package” type of situation? 

2. How long to expect a mix to be done? I’m only doing vocals, with a beat. One of the 2 songs has the beat in pretty much one track, while the other has all the different elements of the beat in separate tracks. I assume the song with the one track beat will be much shorter to mix. I just wanna gauge an average for speed per song so I know how much time to book total.

So far the best I've done is removed an incorrect note, but I hear a noticeable tiny gap where it was. Either this should work and I'm bad at it currently, or it doesn't quite do the job.
2. Punch in recording. Record something before/during/after it, then try to blend it in. I can listen to a problem section and figure out what notes it should have been then record it again, but it still seems obvious that something was done to it. It might have something to do with the sustain pedal of the piano being used before that section, I'm not sure.

So far, either option so far seems out of place. I'm wondering if I should just keep going in one of these two directions until I get it right? Or try sending this to someone on like SoundBetter and see if they can clean it up?

Hi! I’m now working with this SoundBetter mixing/ mastering engineer. And have already payed 260$

I studied mixing and mastering at college and have mixed/ mastered many songs and had clients before. And I know what good vocals and songs sound in terms of mixing. My ears r trained really well.

And I just wanted to get my song mixed by another person to see how it sounds. Cuz mixing and mastering can take up a lot of time. And I’m not too picky as long as they make my song sounds clean and good.


But this first draft he sent me was.. just beyond awful. I’m not shitting on his hard work but the vocals are crackling, it’s the most awful part literally way too crackling and mushed. The levels all over the place and such. 

He’s a nice guy.. but when I listened to the song it sounded like he doesn’t really know lol how to mix.. I don’t really wanna work with him. And I just really don’t know what to do about this I’m like so in shock right now.

Going to rework the lyrics (you can write your verse if you want) and redo my part since it's off a bit. We'll trade off and the other will do the harmony during the others lead (if that makes sense). If you can't hit the harmony don't sweat it you can sing the lead and I can create the harmony through melodyne.

You can use the song however you want and I'll provide you with a lyric video to go with it if you wanna do anything with. All I'd ask is a link to my Spotify and credit but IDC about the money. You can have half the money it makes on my spotify as well which will be close to nothing since music is a soul sucking business!! : )

&amp;#x200B;

Looking for a collab otherwise I'd hire someone off of soundbetter so please don't text me your rate!

All you need is a way to record clean vocals and send me a wav or aiff that's in time. in tune and noise free! You don't need a studio. 

I can help you with the tech if you're not 100% on it. If you have a great voice and just wanna try something different hit me up!!

If you think I suck and just wanna do it solo that's fine too, this is out of my genre but I kinda like it so I just wanna see it through rather than add it to the pile of B sides I never release!!

So I have been toplining songs in my spare time for about 4 years now but up until about 6 months ago, I never knew what the word ""toplining"" really meant. It all started in 2019 when a DJ reached out to me and asked if I would write and sing on his track and gradually more producers and DJs started approaching me for collabs. 
This year, I decided to really lean into this field since I'm trying to do music full time but my largest barrier is my inability to produce my own songs. I've started going on my own Spotify page and looking at my artist radio, then reaching out to the artists (mostly EDM) on instagram and asking if they want to collaborate. So far, I've had pretty good success and have about 10 projects coming out this summer due to me dm'ing artists on instagram. However, going through and messaging people one by one is very time consuming and I'm not being paid, just a royalty split- which is totally fine with me for now, but eventually it would be awesome to get paid for my work. I signed up for websites such as Vocalizr and Soundbetter but I haven't really gotten any views on my profile yet.
Long story short: how did you get into toplining? (or if you aren't a topliner, do you know anything about how to get started?) are there any websites or resources that I should check out to get started?

11ytp2m,1679513182.0,ujober,ujober,Becoming a Song Ghost Writer,"Are you a music enthusiast? Consider becoming a song ghost writer. The process is easy and rewarding, plus it could allow you to make money from home.

Many artists enlist the services of ghostwriters to record more songs while still having creative control over the final product. However, some rappers and fans are wary of ghostwriting because some feel it may erode the integrity of their music.

For those that need a [song ghost writer](https://ujober.com/new/services/i-will-be-your-music-lyric-ghost-writer/) UJober has experts ready to help.

## Getting Started

If you enjoy music and want to get involved, becoming a song ghost writer could be just what the doctor ordered. Many singers and rappers don't have enough time or energy to compose their own material, so they often hire ghostwriters for assistance in developing their ideas.

Writing for others can be a great opportunity to gain experience and understand more of the music industry. To be successful, make sure your client fits well and charges an appropriate rate.

Ghostwriting can be a highly rewarding career in the music industry, and it's relatively straightforward to get started. All that is required for success is an understanding of the industry and an eagerness to work hard - there are plenty of opportunities waiting for those with these traits.

Before beginning ghostwriting, it's important to first determine if it's suitable for you. There are a few steps that must be taken prior to getting started; researching the industry and learning how to compose songs.

Another essential step you must take is registering your songs with the Copyright Office. Doing this protects you from theft and guarantees that you get paid when your song is used.

Once your songs have been registered, you can start searching for potential clients. Start by reaching out to people you already know, such as friends or colleagues; Instagram DM is an ideal tool in this regard.

You can also reach out to musicians who have released music on SoundBetter for Lyrics and inquire if they require assistance with their lyrics. Doing this is an excellent way to build your portfolio and make it easier to find future clients.

One of the biggest obstacles new ghostwriters face is determining which voice to use in their writing. This decision can make or break a piece, as using one's own voice adds authenticity while using your client's voice gives your work more professional flair. Ultimately, great ghostwriters know when to utilize their own style and when to incorporate their client's input.

## Research

If you possess good songwriting talent and would like to be paid for it, consider becoming a song ghost writer. These individuals create songs for other artists and then receive a portion of any royalties generated from sales of those songs.

For decades, the song writing industry has existed and many renowned musicians, comedians, and singers enlist the services of ghostwriters to produce their music. Recently these services have become more commonplace and songwriters are now earning much better rates and recognition for their work (source).

Before beginning song ghost writing, there are a few things you should understand. First and foremost, understand the legalities surrounding it; this will enable you to decide if it's suitable for you. Furthermore, make sure all of your rights are secured before working with a ghostwriter.

Depending on the song you submit for ghostwriting, you may need to grant them written permission to use it. This is especially important if the composition has been created with commercial purposes in mind. Additionally, make sure the person working with you is willing to offer feedback throughout the process.

Furthermore, ensure the person you are working with has a proven track record and previous experience writing songs. This way, you'll know if they can produce high-quality and professional-sounding compositions.

Another important note regarding song ghostwriting is that you should never reveal who wrote your work to anyone else. Doing so poses a high risk and could result in legal action for copyright infringement.

Make sure the person you hire has a solid reputation and has written for other artists. Ask them for references and inquire if they have any past experiences with song ghost writing.

If you're thinking about becoming a song ghost writer, do your due diligence and research the opportunities thoroughly. This will enable you to choose the most qualified individuals for your needs and avoid any potential issues in the future.

## Writing Skills

Ghost writers possess the unique ability to translate their clients' emotions, ideas and experiences into words that people can comprehend. This makes them ideal for celebrities, athletes, politicians and business owners who wish to tell their stories publicly.

Ghostwriting requires excellent listening skills in order to effectively capture a client's message and convey it clearly for your reader. To do this, engage in active listening and ask questions to clarify any points that are unclear.

Another essential skill required for song ghost writing is an extensive knowledge of music. This can come in handy if you plan to collaborate with musicians and composers, since you may need to learn how to produce demo tracks.

Experience is also key for aspiring ghostwriters. This can include articles, blog posts and other types of content. Additionally, writing fiction helps develop storytelling abilities and shows potential clients that you possess considerable talent as a writer.

Freelancing can be an attractive option for ghostwriters looking to expand their portfolios and demonstrate their expertise. This could include writing magazine articles, creating blog posts or self-publishing books. Furthermore, freelancing enables you to receive feedback on your work as well as market yourself effectively.

It is essential to have an in-depth knowledge of different writing forms and text structure. Doing so will enable you to more effectively communicate with prospective clients, guaranteeing they are satisfied with your work.

In addition to producing quality work, you must also be able to meet deadlines. This is especially essential if you are working with musicians and producers on a project as there may be strict timelines for lyrics or rough mixes.

Listen intently and take notes when your clients speak, in order to remember their specific requests later on. Doing this will guarantee that the product you create closely reflects their vision.

If you have a passion for music, becoming a song ghost writer can be an exciting career option. However, it is essential to note that this profession requires time and dedication; it takes effort to build up your portfolio and hone your craft as a writer.

## Getting Paid

If you have the knack for writing songs and want to pursue a career as a song ghost writer, getting started is simple. Platforms like Fiverr can help you launch your freelance career and earn money for your work. Earning an hourly rate may not always be feasible, but if you are good at what you do and can find clients who value your talent, being paid as a music ghostwriter could provide an adequate income.

Many renowned artists hire ghostwriters to craft their songs for them. These ghostwriters are familiar with the artist's personality and can help make their music more relatable to listeners.

Nowadays, ghostwriters typically earn between $10,000 and $20,000 for their anonymous contributions to major-label projects. While that amount may seem high now, it pales in comparison to the $50,000 plus per verse popular rappers can charge.

Though it may seem intimidating to try this type of writing, it can be an excellent opportunity for musicians to break into the music industry. Many musicians lack familiarity with writing their own songs, so hiring a ghostwriter saves them both time and money while guaranteeing they have a hit track ready to release.

Another advantage to being a music ghost writer is the opportunity to collaborate with some of the biggest names in the industry. Your clients may be willing to pay you more because they recognize your talent and trust that you will deliver quality work for them.

Writing songs for popular TV shows or movies can be a great way to build your reputation and earn some extra cash while growing your business. The songs that you compose for these projects may serve as foundational pieces in the rest of your career, provided they are good.

You can collaborate with singers or rappers who want to release as many songs as possible.

However, some rappers and fans are wary of ghostwriting because some feel it may erode the integrity of their music. For those that need a song ghost writer. Before beginning song ghost writing, there are a few things you should understand.

This is especially important if the composition has been created with commercial purposes in mind. Additionally, make sure the person working with you is willing to offer feedback throughout the process. Furthermore, ensure the person you are working with has a proven track record and previous experience writing songs. This way, you'll know if they can produce high-quality and professional-sounding compositions. Another important note regarding song ghostwriting is that you should never reveal who wrote your work to anyone else.

It is essential to have an in-depth knowledge of different writing forms and text structure. Doing so will enable you to more effectively communicate with prospective clients, guaranteeing they are satisfied with your work.

zxezg2,1672247493.0,musicproduction,PikmanDude01,How to deal with meticulous perfectionism in musical project management? I keep running in circles,"I’m a jazz/instrumental composer (and attempted producer), and I’ve been working on eleven tracks for the past three years. I’m an obsessive perfectionist, and find myself very unwilling to release my music until it is perfect or very close to perfect. I’m finding myself constantly changing my mind with regards to who should perform the music, who should mix and master, and other things.

I wanted to hire freelance session musicians from online to play on my tracks, so that they’d have more of a human feel than the VIs. However, I’ve learned that Fiverr is not the best option for me, as the vast majority of the (15+) orders I’ve made have come back unsatisfactorily. This generally boils down to performers not playing with the expressive touch and phrasing I have in mind, playing rigidly and robotically even when reference material (piano recordings I made to indicate dynamics, supplementary to the sheet music I write) is provided. Sometimes, though, the performers are outright unable to perform the music correctly at all, but accept the money anyways. On a handful of occasions, I’ve paid people only to have them submit recordings that sound wholly unpracticed.

I then circled back to focusing primarily on VIs, resolving that it’s unlikely that human freelancers will be able to pick up on the nuances of my musical visions through asynchronous recording sessions organized through a budget freelancing site. In a large number of cases, these do the job well. I’ve had people tell me that they sound indistinguishable from proper recordings (particularly my bass, drums, and orchestra sections). However, there are a handful of instruments, such as saxophones, for which there don’t seem to be any satisfactorily lifelike software emulations. SWAM saxophones just aren’t there yet, IMO. So, at the very least, I need one or more human saxophonists.

Searching for human saxophonists led me to continue searching for other instrumentalists, as well. I do not think I need to hire a trumpeter because good ones are extremely out-of-budget and okay ones likely won’t provide anything usable (my music often wanders into the extreme upper range of the instrument). I’ve received quotes for human performances of almost every track on my album, and, on SoundBetter, the average price per recording hovers around $250. I’m a college student on a limited budget; I just can’t do that to my bank account.

I want to produce professional-quality music, and I think that I’m working healthily towards that point in my composition and arrangement, but in terms of production and project management, I’ve been wandering in circles, throwing money at the walls in hopes of a miracle for three years. This album has turned into a spending problem, which may soon tangibly affect my life. One of my chief life goals is to be a successful and renowned jazz creator, but in terms of releasing an actual product I’m proud of, I’m lost. And that’s not even touching on mixing and mastering.

TLDR I keep changing my mind between getting online freelancers to record my music and having virtual instruments play it, and I’ve wasted a lot of money and time in the process.","i’m a jazz/instrumental composer (and attempted producer), and i’ve been working on eleven tracks for the past three years. i’m an obsessive perfectionist, and find myself very unwilling to release my music until it is perfect or very close to perfect. i’m finding myself constantly changing my mind with regards to who should perform the music, who should mix and master, and other things. i wanted to hire freelance session musicians from online to play on my tracks, so that they’d have more of a human feel than the vis. however, i’ve learned that fiverr is not the best option for me, as the vast majority of the (15) orders i’ve made have come back unsatisfactorily. this generally boils down to performers not playing with the expressive touch and phrasing i have in mind, playing rigidly and robotically even when reference material (piano recordings i made to indicate dynamics, supplementary to the sheet music i write) is provided. sometimes, though, the performers are outright unable to perform the music correctly at all, but accept the money anyways. on a handful of occasions, i’ve paid people only to have them submit recordings that sound wholly unpracticed. i then circled back to focusing primarily on vis, resolving that it’s unlikely that human freelancers will be able to pick up on the nuances of my musical visions through asynchronous recording sessions organized through a budget freelancing site. in a large number of cases, these do the job well. i’ve had people tell me that they sound indistinguishable from proper recordings (particularly my bass, drums, and orchestra sections). however, there are a handful of instruments, such as saxophones, for which there don’t seem to be any satisfactorily lifelike software emulations. swam saxophones just aren’t there yet, imo. so, at the very least, i need one or more human saxophonists. searching for human saxophonists led me to continue searching for other instrumentalists, as well. i do not think i need to hire a trumpeter because good ones are extremely out-of-budget and okay ones likely won’t provide anything usable (my music often wanders into the extreme upper range of the instrument). i’ve received quotes for human performances of almost every track on my album, and, on soundbetter, the average price per recording hovers around $250. i’m a college student on a limited budget; i just can’t do that to my bank account. i want to produce professional-quality music, and i think that i’m working healthily towards that point in my composition and arrangement, but in terms of production and project management, i’ve been wandering in circles, throwing money at the walls in hopes of a miracle for three years. this album has turned into a spending problem, which may soon tangibly affect my life. one of my chief life goals is to be a successful and renowned jazz creator, but in terms of releasing an actual product i’m proud of, i’m lost. and that’s not even touching on mixing and mastering. tldr i keep changing my mind between getting online freelancers to record my music and having virtual instruments play it, and i’ve wasted a lot of money and time in the process.",15,527

Tip 14: Mixing for other people

&amp;#x200B;

**Now in a bit more detail:**

**Tip 1**: Invest in some half-decent headphones

Investing in my first proper headphones was a huge step-up for me. I could suddenly hear detail that I couldn’t before, and it’s very difficult to tweak things you can’t hear!

I like my current Sennheiser 650s, but here are a few other good options:

ATH-M50XBT2:

beyerdynamic DT-770

beyerdynamic DT-1990

More importantly is getting to know the headphones and how they sound. Do this by listening to a lot of music on them!

**Tip 2**: Use reference tracks

I don’t know any producers worth their salt who don’t reference other music, particularly when it comes to the mix. If you load in a reference track to your DAW as similar as possible to what your are creating (in terms of vibe and instruments), attenuate the volume by about 12dB peak (to account for the fact it’s already been mastered), then use a spectrum analyser, it can help with visual cues (as well as the aural comparison, of course).

**Tip 3**: Balance levels and EQ in mono

Personally, I find the stereo image can make determining what’s going on from a transient and frequency perspective trickier, so I just get rid of it! Put a mono-switch on the master channel, and simply switch from mono to stereo and vice versa to check the mix still works. A mix that sounds great in mono will sound amazing in stereo.

**Tip 4**: Use a hierarchical approach to mixing

Mixing 70 or 80 tracks can be daunting. Start with the most important elements and work down in order of hierarchy. So, with dance music: Kick, then the bass with the kick, then the clap (or snare) with the kick and bass, then the lead vocal or synth, then hats, etc. etc.

**Tip 5**: Kick-anchoring at -10dB peak

If you anchor your kick so it’s peaking at about -10dB - leave it alone - and then mix everything else to work with it - the chances are you will have plenty of headroom on your master channel and not run into clipping issues.

**Tip 6**: High-pass almost everything

If you high pass EQ everything apart from the kick and bass at at least 100Hz (but usually higher, depending on the instrument, e.g. a hi-hat), this will leave lots of low-end headroom for your kick and bass. It will help clear up mud in your mix.

Caveat: Please be aware if you do this too extremely you will probably end up with a thin, tinny mix.

**Tip 7**: Separate the sub bass from main bass

Having a separate mixer channel for your sub bass can just make balancing your low-end easier. It also allows you to control the stereo width of the main bass and the sub bass separately. You can either run another track with a second synth for the sub-bass, or just split the signal of your bass in Ableton with an instrument rack. Hi-pass everything below 120Hz from your main bass, and low-pass everything above 120Hz from your sub bass.

Note: You can do this with one bass instrument and no split, e.g. EQ-ing it accordingly, but having completely separate signals allows more (and easier) control.

**Tip 8**: Kick &amp; bass buss

Sending your bass and kick to one buss is a great way to glue them together with a little saturation and a touch of compression. If your tracks low-end thickness and cohesion, this is a great way to solve it.

**Tip 9**: Auxiliary channels for spatial effects

Using auxiliary channels for spatial effects like reverb and delay gives you way more control than having them on the channel itself, as you can process the signal separately from your dry signal - particularly with regards to EQ. (note: sometimes spatial effects on the channel itself is useful, like if you want to push something back in the mix, automate some cool delay effect or want to add compression AFTER the reverb or delay).

**Tip 10**: Side-chain compression on auxiliary reverb

This ties into the last tip. If you side-chain compress your aux channel vocal reverb from your dry vocal, you can push it out of the way slightly when the dry vocal is playing, and then allow it to breathe back in the gaps between the vocals. This was an absolute game-changer for me, and allowed me to work on pop records where the vocal is front and centre.

**Tip 11**: Room reverb aux channel

Particularly good for separate drum sounds, but works on everything. Having an aux channel with a short, room reverb allows you to feed in a small amount of most elements in the mix. This will glue everything together and help it sound like it’s coming from one place.

**Tip 12**: Saturation

Another game-changer. A great tool for adding thickness and perceived loudness to a mix - particularly at the group level, as it glues elements together, too.

**Tip 13**: Checking your mix on multiple systems

If you’ve ever wondered why your track sounds good in your studio, but rubbish in your car, it’s because each system highlights certain frequencies and reduces others. This is why it’s essential to check your mix translates well across multiple systems.

This used to take ages, as I’d have to export the mix, listen to it on two or three systems (comparing it to my reference tracks), go back into the DAW, make the tweaks, and export again! 

Now there is a tool called MixChecker, which is really useful. Of course, if you have a studio with several monitoring options set up, this is quick too.

**Tip 14**: Mixing for other people

This will give you a much broader understanding of music, how to fix problems in the mix and turn out commercially viable mixes! It’s also a great way to earn money from your skills, as there are a lot of people looking to have their music mixed. It’s way easier to monetise your skills nowadays, too, with websites like Fiverr and Soundbetter to offer your services. NOTE: You might consider doing a couple of projects for free to build your portfolio, but don’t make a habit of it. You can also download stems online to practise mixing with.

Hope this helps!",195,0.95,25,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicproduction/comments/zh5a3b/14_mixing_tips_i_wish_someone_had_shown_me/,14 Mixing Tips I wish someone had shown me,14 mixing tips i wish someone had shown me,"I’ve mixed hundreds of songs over the past 25 years, and there are 14 “plateau-smashing” mixing tips that have had the biggest positive impact on the quality of my mixes (and career), allowing me to make a living from music.

Having a separate mixer channel for your sub bass can just make balancing your low-end easier. It also allows you to control the stereo width of the main bass and the sub bass separately. You can either run another track with a second synth for the sub-bass, or just split the signal of your bass in Ableton with an instrument rack. Hi-pass everything below 120Hz from your main bass, and low-pass everything above 120Hz from your sub bass.

Note: You can do this with one bass instrument and no split, e.g. EQ-ing it accordingly, but having completely separate signals allows more (and easier) control.

**Tip 8**: Kick &amp; bass buss

Sending your bass and kick to one buss is a great way to glue them together with a little saturation and a touch of compression. If your tracks low-end thickness and cohesion, this is a great way to solve it.

**Tip 9**: Auxiliary channels for spatial effects

Using auxiliary channels for spatial effects like reverb and delay gives you way more control than having them on the channel itself, as you can process the signal separately from your dry signal - particularly with regards to EQ. (note: sometimes spatial effects on the channel itself is useful, like if you want to push something back in the mix, automate some cool delay effect or want to add compression AFTER the reverb or delay).

**Tip 10**: Side-chain compression on auxiliary reverb

This ties into the last tip. If you side-chain compress your aux channel vocal reverb from your dry vocal, you can push it out of the way slightly when the dry vocal is playing, and then allow it to breathe back in the gaps between the vocals. This was an absolute game-changer for me, and allowed me to work on pop records where the vocal is front and centre.

**Tip 11**: Room reverb aux channel

Particularly good for separate drum sounds, but works on everything. Having an aux channel with a short, room reverb allows you to feed in a small amount of most elements in the mix. This will glue everything together and help it sound like it’s coming from one place.

**Tip 12**: Saturation

Another game-changer. A great tool for adding thickness and perceived loudness to a mix - particularly at the group level, as it glues elements together, too.

**Tip 13**: Checking your mix on multiple systems

If you’ve ever wondered why your track sounds good in your studio, but rubbish in your car, it’s because each system highlights certain frequencies and reduces others. This is why it’s essential to check your mix translates well across multiple systems.

This used to take ages, as I’d have to export the mix, listen to it on two or three systems (comparing it to my reference tracks), go back into the DAW, make the tweaks, and export again! 

Now there is a tool called MixChecker, which is really useful. Of course, if you have a studio with several monitoring options set up, this is quick too.

**Tip 14**: Mixing for other people

This will give you a much broader understanding of music, how to fix problems in the mix and turn out commercially viable mixes! It’s also a great way to earn money from your skills, as there are a lot of people looking to have their music mixed. It’s way easier to monetise your skills nowadays, too, with websites like Fiverr and Soundbetter to offer your services. NOTE: You might consider doing a couple of projects for free to build your portfolio, but don’t make a habit of it. You can also download stems online to practise mixing with.

Some I got directly from better producers than me, some from magazines, some from Youtube, some I figured out myself. Every single one of these mixing tips was a watershed moment for me that markedly “upped my game”, and unlocked a new level of possibilities. I hope you find them equally transformative! I’ve also recorded a video so you can hear examples, if you like  **Tldr** Tip 1 Invest in some half-decent headphones  Tip 2 Use reference tracks Tip 3 Balance levels in mono Tip 4 Use a hierarchical approach to mixing Tip 5 Kick-anchoring at -10dB peak Tip 6 Hi-pass almost everything Tip 7 Separate the sub bass from main bass Tip 8 Kick & bass bussTip 9 Auxiliary channels for spatial effects Tip 10 Side-chain compression on auxiliary reverbTip 11 Room reverb aux channel Tip 12 Saturation Tip 13 Checking your mix on multiple systems Tip 14 Mixing for other people &x200B; **Now in a bit more detail** **Tip 1** Invest in some half-decent headphones Investing in my first proper headphones was a huge step-up for me. I could suddenly hear detail that I couldn’t before, and it’s very difficult to tweak things you can’t hear! I like my current Sennheiser 650s, but here are a few other good options ATH-M50XBT2 beyerdynamic DT-770 beyerdynamic DT-1990 More importantly is getting to know the headphones and how they sound. Do this by listening to a lot of music on them! **Tip 2** Use reference tracks I don’t know any producers worth their salt who don’t reference other music, particularly when it comes to the mix. If you load in a reference track to your DAW as similar as possible to what your are creating (in terms of vibe and instruments), attenuate the volume by about 12dB peak (to account for the fact it’s already been mastered), then use a spectrum analyser, it can help with visual cues (as well as the aural comparison, of course). **Tip 3** Balance levels and EQ in mono Personally, I find the stereo image can make determining what’s going on from a transient and frequency perspective trickier, so I just get rid of it! Put a mono-switch on the master channel, and simply switch from mono to stereo and vice versa to check the mix still works. A mix that sounds great in mono will sound amazing in stereo. **Tip 4** Use a hierarchical approach to mixing Mixing 70 or 80 tracks can be daunting. Start with the most important elements and work down in order of hierarchy. So, with dance music Kick, then the bass with the kick, then the clap (or snare) with the kick and bass, then the lead vocal or synth, then hats, etc. etc. **Tip 5** Kick-anchoring at -10dB peak If you anchor your kick so it’s peaking at about -10dB - leave it alone - and then mix everything else to work with it - the chances are you will have plenty of headroom on your master channel and not run into clipping issues. **Tip 6** High-pass almost everything If you high pass EQ everything apart from the kick and bass at at least 100Hz (but usually higher, depending on the instrument, e.g. a hi-hat), this will leave lots of low-end headroom for your kick and bass. It will help clear up mud in your mix.

Thank you in advance and take care.","i couldn't find a pop music production sub, so i came here. i want to make pop music, i have made one song that i feel like is good, but i don't know it seems like it could've been produced a little bit better. it is so hard to find producers to me because pop music is popular but it's not really what's in style anymore, and i love rap don't get me wrong, but it seems like any time i am trying to look this up all the results i get are geared toward rap, trap, and other genres. it makes me want to stick a needle in my eye. i want was billie eilish has, that tight connection with her producer and someone who truly understands her vision, and what she's trying to convey with her music. i know that it will take a long time and working with many different producers, but it just seems hopeless to me these days because there is such a push for all the other genres. i feel like no one will ever understand my vision either even if they are a really good producer, because it is very specific and sometimes weird, and i need someone who can be on my same page. help!  i'm also pretty broke, so that limits me a lot too. i've just been feeling so down on myself lately because it seems like i really need help with a lot of things in the music world, and a lot of times when i ask for it, people are so quick to judge and say harsh things and get on my case. i just want to find that one producer who can see my vision and help bring it to life.  it seems like the era of pop that artists like katy perry, kesha, halsey, demi lovato, and selena gomez used to create is dying and so now it's incredibly hard for me to find people that specialize in that. just wondering if anyone had any advice. i have tried fiverr, and that was the one that worked out for me, but it still didn't sound as great as it could. i have my music on soundcloud and i let someone on there produce my song and he did it for free, but i didn't really end up liking what he did with it. every time i search on insta, twitter, reddit, doesn't matter what it is i always just see hip hop producers.  i know of a website called soundbetter that might be better than fiverr but it seems pretty pricey. and i know at the end of the day, music production is pricey, sometimes there's just no getting around that. but i feel like there's got to be some people who do it for a more reasonable price and share my same ideas/vibes. any help would be greatly appreciated. thank you in advance and take care.",5,491

The process of mixing songs with my engineer remotely was awful. We could never get on the same page and after about $300 per song, I have 6 songs that I don’t even like the way they sound.

This week, I got a consultation with some guys running a studio near me about my work that’s done, and the set of demos I want to work on next - and they affirmed that the “mixed and mastered” songs are nowhere near what they could be. They want to take the best of those 6 and then a couple of new ones and help me maximize the potential with production, re tracking vocals and instruments, mixing, and mastering. Their rates are $500 for a full day of production/tracking, $375 for mixing, and $50 for mastering. So basically $925 per song. Seems steep but evidently these guys know what they’re doing.

w1xkg6,1658145611.0,soundbetter,sabiansoldier,SoundBetter User Experience- suggestions,"So I'm a big fan of the platform and have been using it for many years. But unfortunately the site has not developed much at all in all the time I've been using it. There are some extremely annoying and obvious improvements that need to be made but they never come.

Some might remember that SoundBetter went through a big update some time back but it was such a broken disaster they rolled it back to the old version, which is where it has stayed ever since. What's amazing is that the new version didn't even fix most of the problems in user experience,, they just gave it a sleek new appearance!

So here is my top list of irritations about the SoundBetter platform

&amp;#x200B;

* **There is no ""Mark Order as Complete"" button.**

Providers deliver the work in a message and then have to hope the buyer marks it as complete. If the buyer ghosts you or forgets to mark the order as complete, you have to get support involved before you can be paid.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Can't respond to buyer inquiries without including a price.**

The flow goes something like: Buyer reaches out to provider about their job, provider draws up a proposal, buyer accepts and the workroom is opened. The problem of course is that the buyer often doesn't include enough information about the project for the provider to be able to accurately assess it. But we can't respond without quoting a price! Surely we should be able to respond to the query without having to quote a price right out of the gate. I get around this by quoting a fake price $12345 until I get enough information out of the buyer to give them a real price. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Messages display the newest messages on the top, oldest on bottom.**

What kind of messaging system has it this way?,, it's ass-backwards! This is one of the things the ""update"" fixed, but alas that was so botched that now we're stuck with the old site apparently forever. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **No persistent DM thread between provider and client**

There is no message thread that persists over the lifetime of the client, there are only individual ""workrooms"" that are specific to one project. If a client hires you multiple times, you end up  with several workrooms with that client, and your conversations quickly become a sprawling mess of messages spread over numerous locations. Trying to find one specific file or message the client sent a while ago in an old workroom? Good luck finding it. There needs to be a persistent thread for general communication, and ""workrooms"" that are specific to a project.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Lack of development on the website**

I alluded to this above, but in five years I have seen little if any real development on the platform. It's basically the same as it was in 2017. The only notable thing on the user experience end was the disastrous overhaul that was rolled back.  What little development there has been pretty pedestrian. Really just adding small features nobody asked for. Here's some of the more recent changes:

&amp;#x200B;

* Added document signing in the workroom
* Enabled self-serve refunds for Premium Providers
* Added Bonus Payment feature for Premium Providers
* Updated the payment checkout for clients (no more payment issues!)
* Added a language filter for clients to help them find the right pros
* Added the option to add your discogs credits in your provider profile
* Added a quick view of 'recent jobs with this client' to invites from repeat clients
* Added 'private notes' to the workroom (track project to-dos)
* Added 'Favorite lists', enabling clients to favorite and save providers in lists for different projects or needs
* Improved the accuracy of the dashboard
* Added an attachments area in the workroom
* Launched 'Rapper' and a 'Dolby Atmos' categories 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally I'd be more interested to see a major overhaul of the core user experience. Fix the problems that have been around since the site launched and forget about adding trivial features.

Anyways those are my biggest grievances with the functionality of the site.

vr4hq4,1656931024.0,soundbetter,sabiansoldier,Honest review of SoundBetter from a premium provider," Just thought I'd  share some thoughts and my experience as a SoundBetter premium provider for the community- I’ve been premium a little under six months now and so far, so good.

I submitted my application around sometime in 2019 and right around February 2022 I got an email out of nowhere saying I’d been accepted. Kind of unexpected but I was happy about it, nonetheless. Decided to see how things pan out.

The first thing to say about premium is that it’s pay-to-play, and it’s hefty AF to be sure. $99 per month or $999 per year. But I figured if I managed to get commissions there worth at least that much, it would be a net positive, and consider the subscription as a cost of doing business.

There are two benefits to being premium according to their marketing page:

1. Premiums appear above basics on the search pages, getting more visibility and more job invites.
2. Sending proposals to jobs on the job board. The job board is accessible to Premium providers only.

The first is a bit hard to measure, but I can confirm that since I have gone premium, I do seem to be getting more commissions organically. Who knows if that’s to do with the search result boost of premium or whether my profile is just picking up steam on its own- my profile is among the oldest and most reviewed in my little niche so it’s impossible to say.

The second is easier to assess- I have been scouting the premium jobs board most days since I got in, and I have gotten hired on quite a number of decent projects that way. Considering my niche is quite specific, it’s a bit surprising how many jobs are posted for it every day. SoundBetter offer email notifications for jobs matching your specialty, which I have. It’s really important to get in there quickly because even as premium you’re still competing with other premiums, and the early bird gets the worm. That said, it is nice to have the opportunity to be proactive in seeking out projects, even if it feels like a rat race sometimes.

To stop premiums from spam applying to every job, they’ve limited the amount of jobs you can apply for each month. This is how they put it

&gt;There is a limit of 10 proposals per month. This optimizes the fit of the proposals and balances the amount of proposals each job receives. Receiving only a handful of proposals provides a better experience for the client, significantly increases the chances they will close with someone, and ensures less competition for you.

The way this works in practice is that you have 30 “credits” that refill each month. Each application costs 3 credits which would make up your ten applications per month. However you can buy extra credits if you run out- for the low low price of $39 for 10 extra- almost $4 per job application! Pretty scandalous price but they have to make money somehow. I’ve never done that and don’t plan to.

So overall I’d say for me it’s just about worth it. It hasn’t changed the game significantly or anything, but it just opens up another way of landing jobs that isn’t available otherwise. Since I seem to be breaking even on the subscription cost it seems to make sense. If that changes then I’ll be dropping it like a hot potato.

Any other premium providers here have any experiences with it? Would love to hear them.",2,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/soundbetter/comments/vr4hq4/honest_review_of_soundbetter_from_a_premium/,Honest review of SoundBetter from a premium provider,honest review of soundbetter from a premium provider," Just thought I'd  share some thoughts and my experience as a SoundBetter premium provider for the community- I’ve been premium a little under six months now and so far, so good.

uaem4w,1650747313.0,edmproduction,RrentTreznor,"Approaching $100k in revenue and over 1 million streams across 6 years. How I ""made it"" as an unconventional electronic bedroom producer.","**Cross posting this from /r/ WATMM - I thought it might be worth sharing here as well:**

**Disclaimer:** If you're looking for a clear-cut way to establish your brand as a producer, you may want to look elsewhere. I wish I could say my success was the result of talent, hard work, and a fundamental understanding of the system - but that's not true.

I'll start by saying I don't know music theory. I can't play a keyboard upon request. Can't jam with a band. My musical creation process relies on a whole lot of chord progression designs through trial and error. Since I don't have an especially clear concept of what notes create what chords, it's a bit more cumbersome of a process than those musicians who can translate a sound from their head straight to piano roll.

My life has always revolved around music, but exclusively from a listener's perspective. It wasn't until I was in my mid twenties that I download a phone synthesizer and began messing around. Then, I graduated to Garageband and, eventually, Logic Pro X. In 2015, I spent about a year creating a couple dozen cheesy songs and releasing them under my own name on Soundcloud.

At this point, I was ready to make my first (of two) monikers and release a single on Spotify. I snagged a royalty free stock photo, manipulated it a bit, and I was live. Fast forward a couple more song releases. I decided I wanted to release another song I just made under a new moniker because it was stylistically a little different. This is where things went bananas. Around 2016-2017, someone in the Editorial dept. on Spotify became my cheerleader and began adding my songs to some high profile playlists for moniker 1. Then moniker 2, which I have no reason to believe anyone knew to associate with moniker 1, ended up getting posted on New Music Friday. A couple hundred thousand streams and multiple lands on the Spotify Viral 50 list for both monikers later, I was as confused as I was excited.

For reference, at this time, I had only the most basic understanding of reverb and EQ. I paid an awesome gentleman from Italy whom I found on Soundbetter $80 a track to mix and master for me. I was pretty picky that he didn't do much stylistically to change the song during his mixing process, but he definitely helped to create a more radio-ready tune - in addition to expanding the mix space a little bit.

Fast forward a few months, and I get an email with a notification that my publisher, CD Baby, is sending me a few thousand dollars. I had gotten a few hundred for the streams so far, but this was something different. It took me about 2-3 more deposits of many thousands of dollars for me to finally figure out what had happened: CD Baby hooked me up. They discovered one of my songs and submitted it for placement in Spotify Ad Studio commercials (I think these are the commercials that folks who don't pay for premium listen to every third song or so).

Fast forward about two years and $40,000 of additional revenue from this one very simple song, and I get a message from a fan saying they saw another song of mine in a Samsung commercial. I thought they were mistaken, but when they sent me the link, there I was. Featured in a Samsung Galaxy Buds Live commercial that went as far as showing my song playing from a phone - on display for the world to see. CD Baby came through again with another placement for another song.

Fast forward tens of thousands of dollars later (same Spotify Ad Studio song), 400,000 streams for my moniker that I stopped releasing in after 2017, and approaching 1,000,000 streams for my current moniker, I look back on the whole journey and don't fully process it. What's interesting is I am still sort of riding high on the coattails of good things that happened to me years ago. Sure, I continue to get paid for my music, but if you combine all the streams of my last ten or so songs, it might add up to half of the streams of just one of the 4-5 singles I put out early in my career that took off.

If I were to surmise why that is, I'd say the reason is twofold. First, I simply didn't capitalize on all that success that occurred at the start of my career. I didn't establish my brand, nor did I go wild on social media trying to keep the party going for as long as I could. That, coupled with the fact that I got in at just the right time, with a sound (featuring a lot of vocal sampling) that hadn't necessarily been repurposed and regurgitated to the point it has today. But, with each new release, I got a better sense of just how saturated not only my market, but *the* market, had become.

With that said, I think I made some interesting tactical moves to make myself known. I picked cool names for my monikers and provided some neat album art. In retrospect, I genuinely think that was half the battle - just finding a way to stand out amongst a sea of album covers and band names - before you're ever even actually heard.

**Note:** There's one important factor I need to add here. I was a playlist curator before I began making music. I love curating music, and still run my low-key indie blog featuring all my favorite new music. But back in 2014-2015, I had a decent following that translated to a couple thousand Spotify followers. And what happened, without any planning on my part, was that when I converted my profile in Spotify to my music moniker, all of those followers immediately became followers of said moniker. My guess? I had some Spotify employees following my playlists and they, in turn, discovered me through that avenue. Pure. Random. Luck. This was not a strategic maneuver on my part, kind of like how Lil Nas X developed a massive twitter following posting memes and videos before releasing Old Town Road. My circumstance was kind of like a poor man's version of that - and completely unintentional.

I wish I could say my success was the result of talent, hard work, and a fundamental understanding of the system - but that's not true. I'll start by saying I don't know music theory. I can't play a keyboard upon request. Can't jam with a band. My musical creation process relies on a whole lot of chord progression designs through trial and error. Since I don't have an especially clear concept of what notes create what chords, it's a bit more cumbersome of a process than those musicians who can translate a sound from their head straight to piano roll. My life has always revolved around music, but exclusively from a listener's perspective. It wasn't until I was in my mid twenties that I download a phone synthesizer and began messing around. Then, I graduated to Garageband and, eventually, Logic Pro X. In 2015, I spent about a year creating a couple dozen cheesy songs and releasing them under my own name on Soundcloud. At this point, I was ready to make my first (of two) monikers and release a single on Spotify. I snagged a royalty free stock photo, manipulated it a bit, and I was live. Fast forward a couple more song releases. I decided I wanted to release another song I just made under a new moniker because it was stylistically a little different. This is where things went bananas. Around 2016-2017, someone in the Editorial dept. on Spotify became my cheerleader and began adding my songs to some high profile playlists for moniker 1. Then moniker 2, which I have no reason to believe anyone knew to associate with moniker 1, ended up getting posted on New Music Friday. A couple hundred thousand streams and multiple lands on the Spotify Viral 50 list for both monikers later, I was as confused as I was excited. For reference, at this time, I had only the most basic understanding of reverb and EQ. I paid an awesome gentleman from Italy whom I found on Soundbetter $80 a track to mix and master for me. I was pretty picky that he didn't do much stylistically to change the song during his mixing process, but he definitely helped to create a more radio-ready tune - in addition to expanding the mix space a little bit. Fast forward a few months, and I get an email with a notification that my publisher, CD Baby, is sending me a few thousand dollars. I had gotten a few hundred for the streams so far, but this was something different. It took me about 2-3 more deposits of many thousands of dollars for me to finally figure out what had happened CD Baby hooked me up. They discovered one of my songs and submitted it for placement in Spotify Ad Studio commercials (I think these are the commercials that folks who don't pay for premium listen to every third song or so). Fast forward about two years and $40,000 of additional revenue from this one very simple song, and I get a message from a fan saying they saw another song of mine in a Samsung commercial. I thought they were mistaken, but when they sent me the link, there I was. Featured in a Samsung Galaxy Buds Live commercial that went as far as showing my song playing from a phone - on display for the world to see. CD Baby came through again with another placement for another song. Fast forward tens of thousands of dollars later (same Spotify Ad Studio song), 400,000 streams for my moniker that I stopped releasing in after 2017, and approaching 1,000,000 streams for my current moniker, I look back on the whole journey and don't fully process it. What's interesting is I am still sort of riding high on the coattails of good things that happened to me years ago. Sure, I continue to get paid for my music, but if you combine all the streams of my last ten or so songs, it might add up to half of the streams of just one of the 4-5 singles I put out early in my career that took off. If I were to surmise why that is, I'd say the reason is twofold. First, I simply didn't capitalize on all that success that occurred at the start of my career. I didn't establish my brand, nor did I go wild on social media trying to keep the party going for as long as I could. That, coupled with the fact that I got in at just the right time, with a sound (featuring a lot of vocal sampling) that hadn't necessarily been repurposed and regurgitated to the point it has today. But, with each new release, I got a better sense of just how saturated not only my market, but *the* market, had become. With that said, I think I made some interesting tactical moves to make myself known. I picked cool names for my monikers and provided some neat album art. In retrospect, I genuinely think that was half the battle - just finding a way to stand out amongst a sea of album covers and band names - before you're ever even actually heard. **Note** There's one important factor I need to add here. I was a playlist curator before I began making music. I love curating music, and still run my low-key indie blog featuring all my favorite new music. But back in 2014-2015, I had a decent following that translated to a couple thousand Spotify followers. And what happened, without any planning on my part, was that when I converted my profile in Spotify to my music moniker, all of those followers immediately became followers of said moniker. My guess? I had some Spotify employees following my playlists and they, in turn, discovered me through that avenue. Pure. Random. Luck. This was not a strategic maneuver on my part, kind of like how Lil Nas X developed a massive twitter following posting memes and videos before releasing Old Town Road. My circumstance was kind of like a poor man's version of that - and completely unintentional. And now? For me, things are good. I have a supplemental income that allows me to fund my passion and provide for my family. I still don't self promote much, and I don't much submit my music to labels, curators, or ad agencies, but maybe someday I will.

on display for the world to see. cd baby came through again with another placement for another song. fast forward tens of thousands of dollars later (same spotify ad studio song), 400,000 streams for my moniker that i stopped releasing in after 2017, and approaching 1,000,000 streams for my current moniker, i look back on the whole journey and don't fully process it. what's interesting is i am still sort of riding high on the coattails of good things that happened to me years ago. sure, i continue to get paid for my music, but if you combine all the streams of my last ten or so songs, it might add up to half of the streams of just one of the 4-5 singles i put out early in my career that took off. if i were to surmise why that is, i'd say the reason is twofold. first, i simply didn't capitalize on all that success that occurred at the start of my career. i didn't establish my brand, nor did i go wild on social media trying to keep the party going for as long as i could. that, coupled with the fact that i got in at just the right time, with a sound (featuring a lot of vocal sampling) that hadn't necessarily been repurposed and regurgitated to the point it has today. but, with each new release, i got a better sense of just how saturated not only my market, but *the* market, had become. with that said, i think i made some interesting tactical moves to make myself known. i picked cool names for my monikers and provided some neat album art. in retrospect, i genuinely think that was half the battle - just finding a way to stand out amongst a sea of album covers and band names - before you're ever even actually heard. **note** there's one important factor i need to add here. i was a playlist curator before i began making music. i love curating music, and still run my low-key indie blog featuring all my favorite new music. but back in 2014-2015, i had a decent following that translated to a couple thousand spotify followers. and what happened, without any planning on my part, was that when i converted my profile in spotify to my music moniker, all of those followers immediately became followers of said moniker. my guess? i had some spotify employees following my playlists and they, in turn, discovered me through that avenue. pure. random. luck. this was not a strategic maneuver on my part, kind of like how lil nas x developed a massive twitter following posting memes and videos before releasing old town road. my circumstance was kind of like a poor man's version of that - and completely unintentional. and now? for me, things are good. i have a supplemental income that allows me to fund my passion and provide for my family. i still don't self promote much, and i don't much submit my music to labels, curators, or ad agencies, but maybe someday i will. i think perhaps my glory days in regards to my music career might be behind me, but i feel pretty confident that my best music certainly isn't. and back to that disclaimer. i really wish i could tell you my success was more than 90% luck. yeah, i think my music sounds awesome, and it's got an inherently unique quality that i don't feel like i come by that often. but there are thousands of artists that are more talented, and in my opinion, more worthy than me that never got their fair shake because the stars simply didn't align the same way as they did for me. still, i am hopeful that this story might offer some insights and perspective that you may not have previously considered. and of course, i hope you guys and girls all find the success you deserve in this incredibly challenging industry!",22,1242
txuyp6,1649275654.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,lostlittlegurl,Getting my music career off the ground... but struggling to write songs?,"Hi y’all. I’ve been a singer since I was two years old, and although I do write songs as well, it takes me a very long time to finish them and I’m admittedly not able to write in the style I actually want to perform. I’m really at a loss for where to start or find collaborators and was wondering how practical it is to hire songwriters say, on Soundbetter or Fiverr? It just doesn’t seem sustainable longterm to me.. so would I be better off just trying to befriend songwriters organically? 

I’m teaching myself production right now and considering taking a songwriting class to improve my skills, but I worry that the ability I’m hoping to gain can’t be taught. It’s just a huge roadblock that I’m for the time being, unable to write music that’s actually fun and effortless. A lot of my songs are heavy personal shit, don’t really have a beat, or are written explicitly for the acoustic guitar; and while music like that has its place in the world, I know it’s not what’s going to sell, and though having a more commercial focus may be taboo in the music scene, it does and has always mattered to me. I want to put out music that showcases my voice to the greatest possible extent, and the lowkey songs I actually pen just don’t do that, “fun” factor aside. 

I know I have the vocal talent that it takes to be successful, and certainly enough writing chops to contribute in some way to my own projects, but I can’t do it alone and I get discouraged because I have no idea how to go about making those connections.

I have such a little capacity for anything right now and working is killing me. My partner and I were going down to one car anyway and I am using some of the money from selling my car to take one month off work to hopefully recover. 

I am a musician and actor with my ""day job"" teaching private students. I work anywhere from 10-25 hours per week, which doesn't seem like a lot, but it is exhausting. I've realized in the past few months it's because I have to mask the entire time during those hours which is just SO much. I hate feeling like I have to be ""on"".

During my ""leave-of-absence"" as I'm calling it, I plan on brainstorming other ways I can make money that will minimize my need to mask (probably doing remote studio work via Soundbetter as I am trained as an audio engineer as well). 

I've taken breaks before but never felt like they helped; they simply put a band-aid on the solution. It feels like the state of burnout immediately begins again when I have to work again. I have no energy for my own music, for any kind of self care, for cooking, cleaning, ANYTHING.

People now exist in the golden age. It’s easier presently than anytime to establish efficient cooperation with other worldwide musicians. You may recruit anybody everywhere worldwide, by simply using your phone.

Inherently completely difficult to found an experts and responsive singers who would be glad to contribute to your tracks diligently, as there are many other people who simply designate themselves “singers”

Fortunately, a lot of resources exist on the Internet where it is relieved to choose an appropriate vocalist. Although, there is another side as well. Searching for employees via online nets may occasionally seem pretty impersonal. It may seem which with another network hand a machine is replying to you, not a human.

Always remember when conducting with eventual employees, they live beyond work as well. Pay attention to the obstacles online companionship presents. You cannot glance into the eyes of another one, revealing to him in what form you wish to see your song, so you should write a detailed briefing and provide any stuff needed to receive the job. Good thinking to contact the human you have chosen before place an inquiry.

Currently, we have considered its needful prerequisite; let’s find out where to find an artist for your hits.

**Social networks**

As corny as it sounds, Facebook with every site network that you apply in your daily routine, for a job or to enjoy, may be very helpful in finding the greatest singer for your song.

The most valuable arsenals are likely Facebook groups. Many artists from across the globe have joined certain groups on Facebook, to seek jobs or cooperation. Take the time to search these groups, so you have no afford to search somewhere else.

**Fiverr**

Every person may also find a suitable artist for his or her hits via online freelance sources as a Fiverr. Here are worldwide freelancers and from a wide variety of areas from sales copywriting, from design to vocalists. Fiverr isn’t concretely designed for audio directors and artists, but it’s really light to pick those freelancers who work in the concern margin.

**SoundBetter**

The source is similar to Fiverr, simply concentrating on music making. This is SoundBetter, which was obtained by Spotify. Such knowledge might help you understand what it is. With SoundBetter you may view profiles of several vocalists or make your vacancy and expect their appeal.

puycp6,1632539013.0,audioengineering,DoNotSexToThis,Soundbetter or worse?,"Recently finished a song as the producer and mix engineer. Figured I'd try getting the song mastered by someone with an outside perspective and more mastering experience and environment. Had a specific mastering house in mind but decided to try, for the first time ever, Soundbetter.

The platform itself is fine, so I find basically the highest-rated mastering engineer that also apparently specializes in similar music and we're off to the races. Their promoted masters sound AMAZING in my studio so I'm excited.

I send 32 bit mix no dither and a LOT of headroom, clarity, no bus processing, etc. along with my own mastered version at 16 bit Pow-r 3 dither for vibe reference, in addition to a reference artist whose music is very similar and contextualizes the sonic goal (which was definitely not utilized).

First return is a massively bricked (literally distorting at some points with THE LOW END ITSELF being a flat chopped waveform) master. No other apparent treatment except a reduction in some offensive high freq and maybe multiband stereo field adjustment from what I could tell.

At that point I realized I should have given more information, so no fault of theirs. I clarify some things and I also ask if there's anything I can do in the mix to facilitate the goal. No answer on the questions, none. I had this idea that they could recommend problematic mix issues from their perspective I could address to assist a better master. No. There was none of that.

Info given and unanswered questions asked, second master comes back quick as hell which ultimately amounts to a dial back on the compression / limiting threshold and seemingly the removal of a sub generator or multiband extreme lift on the low end. Second master now sounds like a louder version of my own master except muddy and less dynamic.

I get it, my mix could require improvements to get where I'm aiming but I don't get any feedback on it at all. So I pay them and thank them for their time. 

Never again.

ppjbsb,1631817798.0,BandCamp,gratitudeaudio,"Engineer from Nashville raising money for a friend, offering discounted professional mixes exclusively for r/bandcamp","Hello there! My name is Dylan Ray, I run a recording studio called Gratitude Audio in Nashville, Tennessee. You might remember as the dude who randomly DM’d you a several-paragraphs-long compliment on one of your tracks, but I’m also known for coming on here and offering to do complete masters for like $20 before every Bandcamp Friday. 

Bandcamp culture (and the site itself) has done a lot for me. I posted my first record on Bandcamp over a decade ago, when I was just making music on GarageBand with a Guitar Hero USB microphone and had no idea that “mixing” was even a thing. I’m really proud of all the music I made during that era, but it also would’ve been nice to be able to afford an actual engineer or producer to make my music sound as good as it possibly could. 

Normally, I’ll come through here before Bandcamp Fridays and offer to do masters for just under half my normal rate. They only take me about a half hour, and I’ve meet a ridiculous amount of talented, wonderful musicians through doing this kind of outreach. It’s not exactly the smartest business move in the world, but it’s incredibly gratifying to be able to meet so many new artists and help them turn their songs into something that sounds loud and detailed and competitive. 

This time, it’s a little different. One of my longtime clients needs some help with their bills, and me offering to do their records at a discount isn’t exactly going to fix that. But they’re very much in need, and I have four empty days in my schedule over the next two weeks. 

So, I’m offering to mix your songs (less than sixteen tracks, under five minutes, limit one person) for $100. For comparison, my normal rate starts at $300 for the bare minimum and goes all the way up to $1000 for more complicated tracks. My wife and I specialize in indie rock / pop, bedroom-pop, and shoegaze - we work as specialists who ONLY mix those genres. (Sidenote: If you hire an engineer in the future, always look for a specialist for your particular genre; it’s much better to hand off your music to someone who knows your ballpark sound than someone who claims to be a “Jack of all trades,” because they tend to be masters of none)

Unfortunately I can only afford to do this for five people, so it’ll be the first five folks who decide to take me up. There’s no strings attached except for the caveats above - I don’t own your song, I you don’t owe me royalties, you just get to help some other musicians in need and get a fancy professional mix for whatever you’re working on at the moment. I’m not posting this on other subs for now; unless I end up with an empty spot on my schedule AFTER this post, this is just for the folks on r/bandcamp. 

I realize this all sounds a little self-promotey, so do feel free to take this down if I’m blowing some advertising rules or something. For what it’s worth, this will literally not profit me whatsoever. It’s just genuinely fun to work on music, and those days would’ve just been empty, so this is the best I could come up with to try to make something good happen. 

If you’re interested, just DM me on here or through my website (see below). I’ll have you send me stems (individual tracks) along with your notes about what sort of vision you have for the final sound of your track. It’s a relatively straightforward process, but if you do have any questions, I’ll also attach a link to my FAQ page below so you can get a better idea of what the whole process is like. (Please read the FAQ - I spent a lot of time making it super specific and have answered just about every question I’ve ever gotten).

I’m really excited to y’all and hear your music, I always have a blast working with new clients from here and I don’t expect this will be any different. Thank you so much for your attention, let’s make some magic happen. 

With gratitude,

ONE LAST THING - before you decide if you’re ready to take me up, make sure you’re happy with the recordings you’ve got. While it’s true that we engineers do possess a bit of wizard like magic, we’re not miracle workers, and the final product will only sound as good as your original recordings. If you’re not confident in your sound, consider re-cutting some tracks before we get together.",6,1.0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BandCamp/comments/ppjbsb/engineer_from_nashville_raising_money_for_a/,"Engineer from Nashville raising money for a friend, offering discounted professional mixes exclusively for r/bandcamp","engineer from nashville raising money for a friend, offering discounted professional mixes exclusively for r/bandcamp","Hello there! My name is Dylan Ray, I run a recording studio called Gratitude Audio in Nashville, Tennessee. You might remember as the dude who randomly DM’d you a several-paragraphs-long compliment on one of your tracks, but I’m also known for coming on here and offering to do complete masters for like $20 before every Bandcamp Friday.  Bandcamp culture (and the site itself) has done a lot for me. I posted my first record on Bandcamp over a decade ago, when I was just making music on GarageBand with a Guitar Hero USB microphone and had no idea that “mixing” was even a thing. I’m really proud of all the music I made during that era, but it also would’ve been nice to be able to afford an actual engineer or producer to make my music sound as good as it possibly could.  Normally, I’ll come through here before Bandcamp Fridays and offer to do masters for just under half my normal rate. They only take me about a half hour, and I’ve meet a ridiculous amount of talented, wonderful musicians through doing this kind of outreach. It’s not exactly the smartest business move in the world, but it’s incredibly gratifying to be able to meet so many new artists and help them turn their songs into something that sounds loud and detailed and competitive.  This time, it’s a little different. One of my longtime clients needs some help with their bills, and me offering to do their records at a discount isn’t exactly going to fix that. But they’re very much in need, and I have four empty days in my schedule over the next two weeks.  So, I’m offering to mix your songs (less than sixteen tracks, under five minutes, limit one person) for $100.

po6ztz,1631639265.0,mixingmastering,noodltube,A very quick opinion about bass and vocal brightness/harshness of a professionally mixed and mastered track?,"I bought a mix&amp;master service from Soundbetter and generally I am very very pleased with the outcome.

The only two things I'm unsure about still are the vocal possibly sounding harsh/""stingy"" and the amount of bass possibly varying throughout the track.

In earlier notes I asked to reduce the harshness of the vocal since it was bugging me (like it kinda felt a bit uneasy listening to it) and it's better now but I don't know if it's good now or not since I've listened to it a lot already.

The other thing being the amount of ""bass"" (as in frequency) was a bit different in different parts (or so I thought) but the guy said it was the same but he still bumped it up here and there and I'm not sure about that either anymore. Like I felt that the drop had way more bass than 2nd verse but he said he mixed them the same and it's the same bass track.

Anyone wanna spend a quick minute to check the vocal and what do you think about the bass ""difference"" in, say, the second verse and the drop?

p71qx6,1629325461.0,mixingmastering,atopix,Community affairs: What are your thoughts on setting a minimum rate on services?,"As you may or may not know (surprisingly quite a few people don't know this), one of the purposes of the subreddit is for people to find mixing or mastering services, and to offer those (if they follow [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/mixingmastering/wiki/rules)).

We have in our wiki [a guide on requesting sevices](https://www.reddit.com/r/mixingmastering/wiki/guide-request) in the sub, and I've been meaning to make one on how to offer them so that we have a consistent guideline.

That, coupled with the fact a month or so ago, someone looking for services as it turns out was demanding the highest quality of service for a slave labor budget. Which prompted me to want to re-adjust a few things.

First thing to make clear, is that I don't want people to use services as a way to practice. You don't need a decade of experience to offer services, but this is not the place to come for mixing practice while making a couple of bucks. Places like SoundBetter and Fiverr already offer a TON of that.

Second point, and what I want to ask the community about. I thought that maybe we could establish a minimum rate for both mixing and mastering services, so that when someone comes looking for a mix, we can tell them ""This will cost you at least X"".

Will people still be able to privately offer services for less? Yes. But here is the thing, people can already do that. And I have no doubt that some people are offering it for free as well.

My thinking is that by officially setting a floor on the value of those services, we'll encourage those who are charging lower to realize they could be charging more. While at the same time, making it publicly visible (for people looking for services and those who are considering hiring someone) what the minimum acceptable is and thus just discourage those looking for the cheapest services to even come here.

To talk specifics, I was thinking of setting a floor of $50 usd for a mix, and $20 usd for a master. And I can see the eyebrows of the more experienced ones raising at those numbers, but before you say anything, hear me out. Since we have a ""No rates in the subreddit"" rule, I've seen a lot of people's rates which I've had to remove, and most of the rates are well below what I'm suggesting. I'm talking $10, $5 dollar mixes.

For those who never hired anyone or even looked into it, professional rates for mixing usually start at around $100 dollars, with an average at around $200-400 and can go easily into the four digits for experienced professionals with a great track record and credits. Professional mastering starts at around $40-50 bucks with an average around $80-$100 and can go to three, four times that for established professionals, Grammy winners and such. This all varies by country of course, but roughly speaking that's what it costs.

Considering that the goal is to both make people understand that offering services shouldn't be used as an opportunity for practice, and to deter outsiders looking for services for scraps: Do you think establishing base rates makes sense? Would you make them higher? Would you not have them at all?

I don't want to make a simple poll, I think this subject merits the discussion and I'm very interested to know what people think. So please let me know!",23,0.96,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/mixingmastering/comments/p71qx6/community_affairs_what_are_your_thoughts_on/,Community affairs What are your thoughts on setting a minimum rate on services?,community affairs what are your thoughts on setting a minimum rate on services?,"As you may or may not know (surprisingly quite a few people don't know this), one of the purposes of the subreddit is for people to find mixing or mastering services, and to offer those (if they follow our rules what the minimum acceptable is and thus just discourage those looking for the cheapest services to even come here.

So please let me know!","as you may or may not know (surprisingly quite a few people don't know this), one of the purposes of the subreddit is for people to find mixing or mastering services, and to offer those (if they follow our rules what the minimum acceptable is and thus just discourage those looking for the cheapest services to even come here. to talk specifics, i was thinking of setting a floor of $50 usd for a mix, and $20 usd for a master. and i can see the eyebrows of the more experienced ones raising at those numbers, but before you say anything, hear me out. since we have a ""no rates in the subreddit"" rule, i've seen a lot of people's rates which i've had to remove, and most of the rates are well below what i'm suggesting. i'm talking $10, $5 dollar mixes. for those who never hired anyone or even looked into it, professional rates for mixing usually start at around $100 dollars, with an average at around $200-400 and can go easily into the four digits for experienced professionals with a great track record and credits. professional mastering starts at around $40-50 bucks with an average around $80-$100 and can go to three, four times that for established professionals, grammy winners and such. this all varies by country of course, but roughly speaking that's what it costs. considering that the goal is to both make people understand that offering services shouldn't be used as an opportunity for practice, and to deter outsiders looking for services for scraps do you think establishing base rates makes sense? would you make them higher? would you not have them at all? i don't want to make a simple poll, i think this subject merits the discussion and i'm very interested to know what people think. so please let me know!",13,308

I decided to change to just doing instrumentals for vocalists (no ghost producing) which made me technically loose a client but he said he's willing to schedule production classes with me.

My main problem is finding new clients, and I know SoundBetter isn't going to help me at all unless I slash my prices by a lot (I charge $400 for a production, mix and master but would probably have to do all that for $100 just to get clients, which I can't do).

I’ve been producing edm for 10+ years now, but I’ve recently found that I love writing and producing songs in different genres like pop, country, edm.

Reason I’m asking is that I really love making these tracks from all over the place, but the concept of being an “artist” can be so confining when you have to think about your “sound” and pleasing a fan base. The concept of having to pitch these tracks to artists is also a pain in the ass since the artists you want aren’t the artists that answer, and the artists that answer aren’t typically the artists you want (I know I’m generalizing here but you get the point).

kprkr4,1609703579.0,musicproduction,GazingSkies,How do you guys promote yourself without coming off bad? [Client work],"Hey guys,

So I'm curious as to how you guys go out and look for client work without it coming off as ""bad"". What I mean by bad is for example, going through different subredits or groups and asking people if they need any work done (like going to a singers' subredit and asking if anyone needs instrumentals). 

I'm mostly asking because currently, I just have a SoundBetter account and a Fiverr account but it's been hard finding clients and the clients I do have are more through personal connections. I know one of the ways to get more client work is to start off by meeting people and building a genuine connection but those take time (even though I prefer that route) but how would one go about ""quick-firing"" your service to people without it coming off as bad or like too much self-promo?

kpn4cs,1609690073.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,FigLeaf1994,Looking for mixing and mastering expertise,"I've used SoundBetter to outsource talent for strings and drums. Now I'm at the stage where I want my songs mixed and mastered. I could use soundbetter again but then I did some research and noticed that people seem to think its not necessarily that great.

I personally had quite a good experience, met some lovely people and got great tracks back. I've seen Fiverr is quite popular and more affordable though.

I have 6 songs in total, all in the genre singer-songwriter/folk acoustic. Very few tracks to them: vocals, acoustic guitar, piano, live drums, violin.

As I don't mix professionally, I am ignorant to the amount of work this might take and therefore vulnerable to paying any sort of price. I would assume this kind of project shouldn't be over £1k but I've been quoted that before.

Looking for general advice on finding a contact and any tips on this process in general.

jxa3ch,1605816253.0,Music,Easton_Redd,Where can I find some good mixing engineers?,"Hey all,

I've been trying to find a mixing engineer to mix my songs but I can't seem to find anyone. I've used soundbetter before, however, all of my mixes came back sounding horrible and distorted, it seemed like the engineer never listened to what I said, the raw recording always sounded better than the actual mix.

I'm trying to work with a budget of $300-$500 per song. Some of the engineers that I have contacted so far (Erik Madrid for example) charge over $1k per mix and that's a bit too much for me.

Anyone have any advice on where I could look?

Also, my genre of music is a mixture of rap/pop/r&amp;b/trap",0,0.5,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/jxa3ch/where_can_i_find_some_good_mixing_engineers/,Where can I find some good mixing engineers?,where can i find some good mixing engineers?,"Hey all, I've been trying to find a mixing engineer to mix my songs but I can't seem to find anyone.

If you haven’t seen my post a couple months ago, i provided mixing and mastering for the the first 2 people that sent me stems for the price of free.99. As i still do, i charge an average of $75 but I like to work on small projects like these from time to time for fun. I’m considering making this a monthly thing just for the heck of it. 

I’m short, this time, I’m offering the same deal this month: mixing and mastering to the first 2 people that message me their stems for their song for the easy price of free.99. i put the same effort into this as if you paid, so no half assed mix. 

the only catch- leave an honest review on my soundbetter page on your experience with me and the quality you received. 

the last time i ran this deal i has great experiences with the artists and i actually took up 3 projects because i had the time, but i received no reviews from them so if that continues then i don’t think i’ll do this very often. 

if you aren’t one of the first few people then you are still eligible for a deal! -shoot me a message on soundbetter and let me know you saw this post on reddit and you will receive a $35 mix and master (over 50% my price) up to 4 songs. visit my website below, go to submissions and pm me through soundbetter :)

Feel free to PM your stems or ask for my email i’d be more than happy to! 

my contact info as well as where to find my sound better and my previous work samples can be found on my website below. if you message me i’ll be happy to personally send them to you. thanks for your time and i hope to work with all of you soon!

ilbqnb,1599069202.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,CarloEspresso,How do I correctly release a single? Advice needed.,"Hi everyone,

I am planning to release my first instrumental song very soon, the mix is almost done! Thanks to the advice I got from reddit, I went with Soundbetter to find a mixing engineer, and it really helped [see my previous post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/gomxif/advices_needed_how_do_i_find_a_good_mastering_and/).

I am so happy, seriously, even if the song gets only 10 listens, to me this an achievement and a milestone in my life…

Ok now I am going to calm down and ask my questions:

Ideally, I’d like to make my music available on all platforms ( Apple, Spotify, YouTube… ) but also protect my work, I’ve heard so many horror stories… better safe than sorry.

So, from what I have read on the internet, this is how I think I should proceed:

Register the song with Audiaum first (I couldn’t register with AdRev), then register the song with CD Baby, and finally post the song on my Youtube Channel.

Last thing, I was eventually thinking of licensing my song on sites like artlist.io or audiojungle.

Here are my questions:

1. Should I use my real name or my artist name when I register with Audiaum (same for CD Baby)?
2. Is it possible to link my profile to my YouTube channel? It would be strange to get copywrite strike for a song I wrote…
3. Will I still be able to license my music, even if it is on Spotify? Do I keep all the rights to my music if I license it? How to make sure that they won’t be any conflict between Audiaum and artlist.io for example?
4. Any recommendation for a cover art? Should I make it myself?
5. Last thing I was wondering, if I want to release a cover of an existing song in the future, how do I get permission to do that ?

Thanks a lot!",1,0.67,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/ilbqnb/how_do_i_correctly_release_a_single_advice_needed/,How do I correctly release a single?

ikwx6k,1599008140.0,MusicInTheMaking,jtdrag,[Offering],"Hey everyone! I’m here to offer my mixing and mastering services for the low cost of Free.99 to the first two people that submit tracks to me. No matter what genre it is or how many stems you have, I am willing to give it a clean mix and master and to my best ability as if it was paid for. I usually charge $50+ for mixing, but I want to work on some additional tracks to get some more practice. The only thing I ask in return is for a review on my profile on SoundBetter linked to this post which also has a plethora of my previous work. If you’d like more samples of my work please reach out and i’d be happy to send. 

If you’re interested please send a PM to talk more about it! (and if you’re not one of the first 2 and really interested, then i’ll mix it for half price of my rate, $25)

I look forward to working with you all and hopefully more of you guys in the future. Thanks a lot!

*EDIT: Thank you everyone that has submitted their tracks and sent messages! The two slots have been filled! i appreciate all of you!! as much as i’d love to sit in front of all of your songs, I may not have the time for it :/ But I’m still taking on commissions for my promised $25 per song, and because so many people submitted music i’m willing to do $40 for 2 songs! Only for the next month or so! Thanks again everyone and keep making great music!

I know you get what you pay for in this business. But I’m gonna be honest, I can’t afford close to the full on professional mixing service costs (which seems to be at least $300 per song). At best I can afford half of that price per track. At the same time I want to release my tracks on streaming services. 

I was wondering the best places to look for any mix engineers that can fit my budget? I’ve checked Fiverr, but I’ve seen people say it’s hit or miss. Checked soundbetter, which seems legit. Or is searching on Reddit the perfect place for someone in my situation?

I would ask for services here, but I think I might have to make a separate post, and I’ll do that when I’ve left the studio.

I still know nothing but am improving everyday thanks to this community and YouTube. I have been working with vocal samples (outside of Splice as they are used everywhere) and things are turning out OK. With that said, I want to take the step to work with real vocalists (Fiverr or SoundBetter).

**That said, I have no idea how the process even works in terms of actually making the music.** 

With the vocal sample (or remix), I can build the entire track either utilizing the melody in the verse for the drop (or making up another melody) with my own chords, bass lines, rhythms, percussion, fx, etc.

With a vocalist, am I just giving them a sheet of music (which I wouldnt know how to do - all my reading of music is confined to FL studio) and the lyrics? They come back with wav/midi files I can dump into my project?

How do more seasoned producers do it? There are LOTS of artists on Spotify with sub 10,000 followers (an amazing accomplishment) that are banging out tracks on a monthly basis with new vocalists. Are they using similar services or do record labels just have singers on demand. Are they taking an already established verse / piece of music and turning it into a full process? Is it a collaborative process between the two? Does someone just lay down chords and then a jam session and voila?

evsw2f,1580330495.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,GrandCharlie,Has anyone worked with producers from Soundbetter or other services that have A-List credits?,"I recently submitted a track that I have been working on to Soundbetter to see what kind of proposals I might get for some mixing/mastering work.

They also offered to pitch the song to a number of Sync Licensing agencies. 

While this all sounds awesome, I'm worried it sounds to good to be true, and that I'll be spending over twice the amount I had planned on budgeting for something that wouldn't be worth it.

I'm currently working toward a certificate in Lyric Writing from Berklee School of Music. I work as a freelancer on Fiverr &amp; Soundbetter, and I've been called brilliant, friendly, and professional. Here are some of the types of songwriting services I offer:

\-Work with you to create a song from scratch

\-Help you turn your poem or lyrics into an original song

\-Adjust your existing lyrics to add rhythm/rhyming

\-Write lyrics to a melody, or a top-line for your beat

\-Write &amp; record a duet for your existing original song

\-Provide backup vocals or harmonies for an existing song

I have the most experience in the genres/styles of pop, folk, and broadway, but I'd love to broaden that. Whether it's a parody of a song for a YouTube skit, a theme song for a web series, an informal birthday gift for a friend or partner, or something you plan to release commercially, I'm happy to help!

I can usually work with quick turnarounds when needed, and prices are negotiable. I typically offer **$35 for writing only music or only lyrics, or $55 for music &amp; lyrics. For an additional $20, I will create a very simple instrumental or electronic backing track for the song.** I prefer to receive credit as a songwriter if you release commercially, but will not ask for royalties.

dsk07s,1573063195.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,Lordofchords,Streaming service revenue is up 63% from last year. Spotify is growing rapidly and so are the tools we have at our disposal to leverage our careers as musicians. Is this good or bad for independent homegrown artists?,"Every time someone tells me it's ""harder"" to have a career in music than it's ever been before drives me insane. 

The absolute truth is that the industry is growing, the market is growing, the tools YOU have at your disposal are growing, the potential money you can bring in as an artist- growing. As a result, the competition is also growing... 

And if your attitude is that this is somehow impossible to do because there's too many people doing this then the only thing that's FAILING to grow is probably *you*

""Interactive streaming, through services like YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music Unlimited, is now dominating the industry even more than before. Revenue from those services is now 63% of overall industry revenue, and total subscribership has topped the 50 million mark.""

I mean. Streaming. Anyone can get their music on these platforms. They're expanding. The tools they offer artists is insane. Spotify just bought Soundbetter. You can be capitalizing on this. That's 50 million potential fans. Holy shit. 

Let's not forget that seven year old kids bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars on Youtube for reviewing TOYS. That's never happened before the modern social media culture we have created. Ever. The possibilities are absolutely insane. 

We can look at it two ways: there's too many people and I'll never be heard (defeatist attitude)

Or we can look at this as an absolute win and a system we can leverage to build a phenomenal career. (Winning attitude) 

I'm not an expert on Spotify or YouTube but I can tell you what the common denominator is for alllll the various platforms out there- it's the same thing it's always been: people. Someone figured out how to identify a large group of people, create content deliberately designed to reach them, and then went and delivered it to them effectively in a way that resonated with them. When you're seven, that probably looks like vicariously playing with toys which is what that guy brings in a ton of cash. 

When you're an adult, the options are far broader- which is a good thing, because there's a shit ton of people making various types of music. Hell, one of my clients (totally unknown, no fanbase, first release ever) did 7k YouTube views in two days with a $30 Preroll campaign, because we made content we thought would work well for the audience we were marketing to. And it did. 

Anyway. I thought this was dope and it gives me hella energy to keep building my business as a producer, knowing that the tools my artists have to succeed are so powerful and broad now. 

What do you guys think? Is our music just a drop in the ocean? Or can this growth be leveraged to build an amazing career?

On the heels of DigitalAMN’s signing of Project JAM, [Spotify announced the acquisition of SoundBetter](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=lHlBIH6ZYpyIsFDT9LY_aWWE1d7lkdhVTETz0TIoIG3dHSvyKAGs1jvDyTAba554r5QBOIk9Ihy8UmH8yu_qtx4mCwDhKBV8Do3xfHYNhknJWp8fgfdk_rcXNL2124AXCdodWp_VQsfF9OdYQ3tcYLdWTkTXIskfDFUJkc4CQfUNZVWQ7Y-cnZdWkp50c6epsVA7EVw0lD4f7u__aWg9vmaumfpp0JqFJG5-ulq1fUFDxZZMxTlIOAqeWgIEf_Jz), which is the largest competitor to Project JAM.

“After attending a music showcase event September 20th at the Peppermint Club in Los Angeles, where [JAM announced its equity crowdfunding offering](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2HZmHCwnh-CZPVFpqpxsCyXek-jzr2dWS_K8Nb0gW2fFNoAp92jQwlv_BxR1_2BBMfZaCPesqnW_7fpVbTQBMHhRZjdNibagYLO38_4mJ8w6lfXf8fGSdccJQw7m8U85gNfa6umYtEVneQZAqTxdIc0EMhG91bKwagdEuyncBMt2zt6oJ_RGnZCm2AfVXbeIBS1vobXmMjdSpqCG4SkEfdyf5CpyfFdkXYA25pstDUqg2rsFhFnoRLntgxW8zsfs4vxkTg9Q_kW27eglVylWgw==) on TruCrowd’s MusicFy, I can confidently say that I believe Project JAM is one of these companies that just gets people excited and motivated about music,” stated Ajene Watson, CEO of DigitalAMN. “And, given the recent acquisition of SoundBetter by Spotify, I know that by us making this investment into JAM, we are strengthening the future of our overall value proposition.”

DigitalAMN typically assists client-companies in leveraging the JOBS Act \[Titles III and IV\], as part of DigitalAMN’s PAI acceleration model. The [decision to invest in JAM prior to its Reg.

With this initial investment, DigitalAMN has committed to fund a portion of Project JAM’s capital requirements. It is anticipated however, that JAM will not only meet, but exceed its capital requirements during its equity crowdfunding raise on TruCrowd’s specialized music portal, [MusicFy](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=lC7JJU4RU89a2-prZIeNuqfRPbdpXFEiD2ixkIBxA1zf2s0ZmhijWLfOPWCLvUJv).

Project JAM’s mission is to bring transparency and justice to the music industry. Project JAM is an ecosystem which caters to musicians, songwriters, producers, audio engineers, industry execs and fans, to address the challenges which have long plagued the music industry. Writers, artists, musicians and other music professionals will have opportunities to formalize the ways in which they are discovered, rated and hired by their peers. 

“Establishing a startup and building that business is never easy, especially in music,” stated co-founders of Project JAM, Inc., Anthony Pisano and Tony Livadas in a joint statement. “We needed money and we needed guidance. Most of all, we needed someone that would show up for us because we represent ‘real lives… real people’, and not simply another number on some house-hold brand accelerator or funding portal. With DigitalAMN, we’ve so far received what every startup initially needs – structure, opportunity and capital. With their assistance and direction, we’ve received the jumpstart we needed and we believe Project JAM and JAM Compass will ultimately be better because of it.”

Watson concluded, “This initial investment into Project JAM brings the count of our music assets to three \[technically\] – having [Vezt, Inc. as an Angels+ portfolio client](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=nBBqrSbq2wn2x4k7u5OqgghkS8_EP-bdtqt6X7zEJ5J9hxwVDYlIc_Y93veHH20jPSDx7fOPgz2M1ZhN8BomPjc3chBqOTtpa69Pe6jOfWE2uj0tiEmRo6EOCpXKFfLNv_pjisVqYR1UET0DAMYka60IkYClzwoNHBZ1C4VhXDSu4578bWJ4Li6tfdMIs4Jf79jMzTcTNnkAWvVPtlpDVTOSMdzMJTn0oDZESVo5udnezOyi7cHCFtqZc8oCD2vtz0nYUA1oKGBQud7Cme3LurIi6WCfXT3bHt97VWudnEzu_7hZkUKn5jEVVBvSoF5_), along with MusicFy as an asset through TruCrowd, Inc. What makes the JAM investment so exciting of course, is its similarity to SoundBetter. SoundBetter has roughly 180K+ users and generates millions of dollars in monthly transactions, whereby we believe that Spotify clearly sees the value proposition in being a part of the music industry ecosystem. In our ongoing work with Vezt, we could identify that JAM, with the right backing and guidance, could be a strong competitor to SoundBetter, while being synergistic to [Vezt’s music royalty sharing platform](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=2V5CAoj1qiBHohjYn35JU9p3B4J5dcoB4uQ4CuQXfnTlAKnwHlG4oxt2toI8YuwfohG1is30aGY6dSNQ0zwYtIm6ktZz3u5Khq76mxo_yfuVszSW9H1M9ethCZZEBB27). We believe that Project JAM could potentially benefit from Spotify’s acquisition of SoundBetter, considering it supports a more robust social platform with its On-Demand feature.”

Project JAM’s management team also has an impressive reach within the music industry and their network extends far beyond, into other markets such as gaming – where influencers like Faze Blaze of the FaZe Clan are amongst JAM’s founding investors.

d4nusx,1568569877.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,HobiWanJablobi,Drafting (Songwriting) Contracts,"Hey WATMM,

Ran a search through the subreddit but I don't think I was able to find what I was looking for. So thought I'd ask here.

Last year I attended the Global Game Jam, and did some lyrics/dialogue for the game. The composer on our team approached me and admired my work enough that he wanted to hire me to help with his song lyrics (and potentially other work - mixing or composing, but primarily lyrics). 

We would both like to draft a contract, but I am unsure where to start. He believes offering an upfront fee for the work + royalties would be fair, and is more than willing to go back and forth to figure something that works out for both of us.

If you are just starting as a freelance sound engineer and you have never had a paying client, these 10 tips will help you. Even if you already have paying clients this can be beneficial for you.

The tips and techniques I share in this episode is what I did when I started out, and still do.

Before we get into these techniques, I want to let you know that this doesn’t happen overnight. It takes time but be patient and consistent in the work you put in and you will see results. 

When I started it took me a few months to get my first paying clients. I was still in college and was doing free recordings for bands I found around London. This eventually led to paid work.

The 10 Tips are:

1. Record Bands Or Artists For Free
2. Shadowing
3. Don’t Ask For A Job
4. Build Up A Portfolio
5. Study
6. Lead Magnet
7. Build Meaningful Relationships
8. Apply For Jobs/Projects Online
9. Use SoundBetter, Fiverr or Upwork
10. Run Facebook Ads

bxl3oc,1559850473.0,edmproduction,Hypersaw,How could I find a (really) good producer to hire ?,"I am a songwriter and a composer, I write my songs, my music on piano, and then I would love to record vocals and chord progression + melodies, and find a talented producer to produce my songs to a pro level.

&amp;#x200B;

My favourite genre by far is progressive house, songs similar to this :  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mX6LyBvUes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mX6LyBvUes) 

&amp;#x200B;

You may ask : ""Why don't you become a producer yourself ?"" =&gt; Well... I have a bad hearing, and everything I would do (as a producer) would sound very amateur. This is one of the reason.

&amp;#x200B;

When I see ghost producing websites, wich sell ghost productions (I don't want to buy one, but I look just for informations), 95% of the productions are lifeless, most of the progressive house / EDM are very bad sounding, cheesy melodies, cheap synths, bad arrangement it all sounds horrible.

It feels like this kind of people are beginner and/or just make badly produced tracks in hope of easy money.I can understand them because having our name hided once the track is released isn't motivating to make good work.

&amp;#x200B;

So, to make it short : should I directly contact producers that I like (most are independants producers and not superstars, or should I go with a specialized in working for other artists producers ?

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, there is a Soundbetter website too where you can hire a studio producer.

&amp;#x200B;

Many are EDM producers, and most of them, if not all, are professional. But I doubt they really master each specific genres of EDM, and so I am a bit worried about hiring one of them.

So, do you think that it would be a better approach to contact one talented producer that I like, and asking him to work for me ?",1,,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/bxl3oc/how_could_i_find_a_really_good_producer_to_hire/,How could I find a (really) good producer to hire ?,how could i find a (really) good producer to hire ?,"I am a songwriter and a composer, I write my songs, my music on piano, and then I would love to record vocals and chord progression  melodies, and find a talented producer to produce my songs to a pro level. &x200B; My favourite genre by far is progressive house, songs similar to this     &x200B; You may ask  ""Why don't you become a producer yourself ?"" => Well...

What Im trying to ask is what can I do drive in business to my studio? I've been engineering for 7 years and im damn good at it. Im currently mixing for a local R&amp;B artist in ATL that wants to make me his primary engineer, and mostly been mixing my own vocals through the years.

b7qkdh,1554055052.0,musicproduction,Hypersaw,How much cost a music producer in EDM ?," 

Hi ! I decided to work with a music producer to produce and mix my music, in a professional way of course.

The reason I do that is that I have hearing loss on high frequencies, so mixing would be very difficult for me.

But to be short : I am into Pop/Progressive house. I write my lyrics, compose my music, so the producer will NOT have to compose everything by himself.  
I will record many instruments (piano, guitar, violins, etc.) and vocals and then send him to work on. For the drop part (especially for progressive house), I will make a quick draw of what is needed. But I will also give him the melody, many layers (I use Nexus2 a lot and you have plenty ready to use sounds).

So basically the producer have to mix/master, and work on the arrangement. He will have an important role in the music creation, because he will add many instruments (kick, effects, layers) and a big role on the song structure (making breaks/risers). But the core of the sound would be from me.

So, here is my question : what would be the price for an EDM professional producer ?

On a forum discussion, someone said that it was between 900 dollars and 4800 dollars on average, and that basically 900 dollars would be a very bad result (wich is absurd for me, why would you pay for something bad ?!!)

And I contacted many pro studio producers on Soundbetter. One of them is a Trance producer wich is played on A State Of Trance by Armin Van Buuren, and which has his music published on Armada music.

Obviously his music sound very good.

And he say me this : ""Budget wise $600 per track would be a honest industry standard from what I know as well from Armada, especially with mixing and mastering the track too "" to produce my music.

I contacted some other producers. One said 700 dollars, the other said me his minimum charge is 790 dollars (mix/master included).

So it is far far away of the 2500 euros per track without any mixing.

Could you explain me what are the most common price for an EDM production ?

a9o54r,1545826820.0,makinghiphop,Jekkert,Here's a little overview of what made 2018 a pretty decent year for me as a producer/beatmaker. I hope it can help some of you make next year a good year :),"First of all I’d like to state that I am in no means the best producer/beatmaker in the world. Neither am I the most successful: I still have to work a part-time job in order to be able to pay my rent, food,cigarettes and wine (Merlot over everything!). Having said that, the money I made from music has allowed me to work less hours and buy some nice equipment. Here are some tips I wish I had found earlier! 

(Also please note my SoundCloud is just my personal space of stuff I enjoy doing in my free time, it doesn't reflect my 'professional' work) 

**Resources**

*	**/r/MakingHiphop** is without a doubt my go-to page whenever it comes to active discussion on the topic of music-production and feedback. The ability to post a song a day that you receive feedback on is amazing. Use this feature whenever you are wondering whether you nailed the mix, or fucked it up. 

*	**/r/Drumkits** is the place where I get most of my drums. Can’t say much more about it. 

*	**Vinyl Frontier** is my go-to YouTube page whenever I’m looking for samples online. I usually don’t sample from their uploads, but instead look up different songs by artists that they upload. This way I won’t be sampling the same song as 50 other beatmakers. 

*	**Record Shops** are obviously the most fun place to hunt samples. I have a simple guideline for myself to be sure to pick out some fire. If the bandname starts with ‘The’ and is followed by any plural noun you are usually safe. Think ‘The Temptations’ and ‘The Imperials’. Anything Jazz later than the 30’s or 40’s is usually safe too. Also buy any record with naked women on the cover. You never know when your internet might be down.

*	**Splice** is amazing. It’s worth the money. Get it ASAP when you can afford it.  


**Plugins** 

I had originally written a little section about the plugins I use, but it wasn't really interesting when I read it again. The only thing I can really say on this topic is that **Lounge Lizard** is my favorite VST ever made. 

**Making Money**
 
*	My first money was made on **SoundBetter.** This website is amazing. Half of the users request something custom-made, and the other half would like to buy beats of your SoundCloud. Their SEO (I think this is what it’s called, but I’m not absolutely sure because I’m not that into the whole marketing-shabazz) is crazy. Whenever you google Beatmaker + The city I live in, the link to my SoundBetter profile is the first link that pops up. How crazy is that? I never did anything about this myself. This landed me quite a few jobs and allowed me to upgrade my home studio significantly. I also met a ton of great people, some of which I truly consider to be friends now.  

*	**Beatstars and Instagram** are a great way to make a few bucks too. Make sure to market the living shit out of your beats on Insta, and link users to your Beatstars profile. I am an absolute idiot when it comes to marketing so I don’t do this myself, but my friends do and it makes them quite some money. 

**General tips on making money**

*	Say **YES** to every job you get. This might sound strange, but I accept almost every job I get asked  to do. Not because I desperately need the money, but because I want to learn new things. Whenever I get paid to do something it motivates me. So if you pay me to do a trap beat (which isn’t my style of preference), I will deliver an absolute fire trap beat, even if it means I have to do some research on how to make it work. I also apply the same principle on life in general. Whenever someone asks you “Can you do X”, I just say yes. The internet will tell me how to do it. 

*	**Pricing** can be difficult. I ask 70$ for projects that I enjoy doing. I ask a little bit more if it’s a boatload of work OR whenever I feel like I’m not going to enjoy the process of making it. I always offer big discounts on a big project. Some time ago I supplied 8 beats for an album but I charged for 6. Partially because I really liked the artist, but also because it incentives someone to make a big purchase. 

*	Be **communicative and friendly.** I mean this should go without saying, but it’s so goddamn important. I always offer a 100% money back guarantee if the client is not a 100% satisfied with the provided work. A, because it makes me provide the best content and B, because it makes a costumer trust me. 

**General shit that helped make 2018 a pretty decent year music-wise**

* 2018 Made me understand that luck plays an enormous part in success. I am not an incredibly talented beatmaker, but I did land quite a few big jobs this year. Partially due to the fact that I was at the right time at the right place a few times. I work at a studio and was lucky enough to be there when a fairly big rapper came to record there. Sadly I didn't get a chance to collab with him, but I did record him which looks pretty decent on my resume. I realize however that having a good **network** increases your chances of success: this would be one of the most important things that I've learned this year. Get out there and meet people. Go to open mics and talk to rappers and link up! Send a local rapper a DM and see what happens! 

* The absolute biggest thing I learned this year is that **work ethic** matters greatly. People love it when you show you are able to work hard and are able to solve problems on the spot. Showing passion and enthusiasm is valued greatly by people that you work with. 

* Whilst 2018 was a pretty good year overall, it also had some bad stuff in it. I rap on the side and through some friends a demo ended up at a pretty big record label. I was so sure they were going to like it and I would skyrocket to fame: but the opposite happened. While I thought the demo was the best thing I've ever written, they replied and said they thought it was unoriginal and the writing was mediocre at best. I decided to just keep on doing what I do, but I was contemplating on quitting music altogether. Then later this year somebody somehow (still no idea why the fuck this happened) decided to upload a video of me rapping to a Worldstar-like website. I got absolutely slaughtered in the comments. While I can laugh at it now, when it happened I stayed indoors for two days staring at the ceiling while feeling sorry for myself. I again contemplated quitting music altogether, but in the end decided to ignore it and use it as an opportunity to better myself. I guess what I'm trying to say is that bad stuff will happen, and it will happen to you too. The most important thing is not how it happens, but how you react to it. Me bouncing back from two setbacks have taught me that resilience and a 'fuck it'-attitude are priceless. 

I hope this little write-up can help some of you to make next year a success. I know there's an awful lot of crazy talented people on this sub, and I hope you all make it. Also merry Christmas and all that.

a40502,1544191335.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,TiltAbricot,Finding the good pro and creative mixing engineer for my songs,"I produce my songs. I strive to have a professional sound, I do it very carefully. The number of tracks is quite high (50 to 80). The style is indie rock, I guess (the drums are played on electronic drums by using superior drummer, but I still have drums instead of a beat, and quite a lot of guitars).

My problem is to find a mixing engineer for them. The thing is I would like a guy with a sound of his own, someone being able to bring a creative perspective on the project. Ideally someone to work with on the long run.

For me the options are :

1. Soundbetter / upwork / Gearslutz etc. Where you can find a pro, but it's a ""generic"" pro. You see he can mix, but I'm not sure that he really has a sound. I am usually not impressed. Usually for up to 300 to 400 $ a day (I guess you could mix one of my songs in a day)
2. At the opposite end of the spectrum, as I am a very big fan of the Shins and Fleet Foxes, I asked Phil Ek and for the Tame Impala sound I asked Dave Fridmann! :) Fridmann never responded but I got a response from Phil directly which was cool. Obviously the price is higher (between 1000 and 2500$ per song, not including studio fees)

=&gt; What I'm looking for in between the 2. Somebody with a real sound and accomplishment but just below the Phil Ek/Dave Fridmann level. I keep scratching my brain for albums that I like that would be not the superstar status, to find the mixing engineer on discogs, but it's quite hard. Maybe the next still unknown genius in the indie sphere :)

I'd like some perspective. Anybody has experience on the subject ? Am I overthinking this ? 

I am not asking for names (although if you do in the same vein that would be cool) but more if the method makes sense and if you have tips.

Please don't advertise your service to me in this thread, it's not the goal.

I'm tired of going through tens and tens of beginner to mid level applications.","i produce my songs. i strive to have a professional sound, i do it very carefully. the number of tracks is quite high (50 to 80). the style is indie rock, i guess (the drums are played on electronic drums by using superior drummer, but i still have drums instead of a beat, and quite a lot of guitars). my problem is to find a mixing engineer for them. the thing is i would like a guy with a sound of his own, someone being able to bring a creative perspective on the project. ideally someone to work with on the long run. for me the options are  1. soundbetter / upwork / gearslutz etc. where you can find a pro, but it's a ""generic"" pro. you see he can mix, but i'm not sure that he really has a sound. i am usually not impressed. usually for up to 300 to 400 $ a day (i guess you could mix one of my songs in a day) 2. at the opposite end of the spectrum, as i am a very big fan of the shins and fleet foxes, i asked phil ek and for the tame impala sound i asked dave fridmann! ) fridmann never responded but i got a response from phil directly which was cool. obviously the price is higher (between 1000 and 2500$ per song, not including studio fees) => what i'm looking for in between the 2. somebody with a real sound and accomplishment but just below the phil ek/dave fridmann level. i keep scratching my brain for albums that i like that would be not the superstar status, to find the mixing engineer on discogs, but it's quite hard. maybe the next still unknown genius in the indie sphere ) i'd like some perspective. anybody has experience on the subject ? am i overthinking this ?  i am not asking for names (although if you do in the same vein that would be cool) but more if the method makes sense and if you have tips. please don't advertise your service to me in this thread, it's not the goal. i'm tired of going through tens and tens of beginner to mid level applications.",11,370

Almost every guy I’ve used from there has either sent back “deliveries” that had beyond blatant, simple errors in the mixing (I guess to get me to use up all my “revisions”), spent five minutes on the song and sent sloppy garbage (I can see when they downloaded the files from WeShare), or lied about/embellished their credentials (“I have twenty years of experience!!”). I’m not even someone who has good ears and is sensitive about this shit. It just seems like a lot of these guys just give absolutely zero fucks and will send back complete garbage/are thirteen year olds that watched two mixing tutorials from “BusyWorksBeats” on YouTube and think they now have a genius money making scheme.


All of these guys have been between the $5-$30 range, so it’s not really a surprise they would suck/not care. However, a guy who usually charges $120 liked my previous song (supposedly) and gave me a giant discount and has been mixing a song for me for the past three weeks. I was blown away by how he actually, you know, seemed to care about making it sound good after he sent me the first preview, but he has to work on his full price orders (understandably) before he finishes mine, and it has been about three and a half weeks.


I can’t have this guy take three weeks on every song of mine, because I obviously want to constantly be releasing new shit. However, I can’t be spending $100+ from guys off SoundBetter constantly either. Is there any middle ground between the shitty “$5-$30 jobs” and the “$100+ jobs”? I would definitely pay $75 a song or so if someone actually took care about not making mistakes.

770ijf,1508264658.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,skarred_w,Royalties/rights - questions before using SoundBetter,"Hi guys!

I've been struggling to find some good vocalists in my area, to bring my productions to the next level, SO I browsed through SoundBetter, and found a couple of singers &amp; songwriters, who can help me with that.

I searched for people who can write a top-line melody, write the lyrics, and track the vocals as well. An all-in-one package, obviously.

So I contacted them, and got some prices, which I'm pretty OK with, BUT here comes the next thing: there are some mentions of ownership/publishing rights which i'm super confused of.

Here's an example: 
    Ownership/Publishing 
     - 50% Top Line (melody/lyrics/ full song) 
     - 25% Hooks/ Choruses 
     - 25% Edits/ Arranging/ Co-writes

So, for starters, I would like to self-release the track, meaning that I would use TuneCore to get it out there. 

Does this mean, that I would have to share 50% with the vocalist from the royalties I would get from iTunes purchases/Spotify plays/Apple Music plays etc. ??

I feel that the flat price that they already ask for the vocals is quite high already, so sharing the income royalties from the music sales/streams is kind of unjustified. Especially since they ask for 50/50, meaning that me and my colleague (+ manager) would get a smaller cut of the money per person, than the singer itself.

I'm a little bit confused about the **ownership** part, and the publishing rights as well. I might be confusing the various types of rights here...",0,,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/770ijf/royaltiesrights_questions_before_using_soundbetter/,Royalties/rights - questions before using SoundBetter,royalties/rights - questions before using soundbetter,"Hi guys!

6rjt3e,1501845666.0,Songwriters,Ed_Bokonon,Some advices for the old_school guy.,"Hello to everyone !

I need to some advice.

Maybe a short note about me at the beginning to helps you understand my case.

I’m songwriter (not producer) and kind of hook/riff_maker (someone who gives an ideas / catchy themes and can easily transform them into whole arrangement track or song).

Perfectly finds myself to work in larger groups, especially with topline writers, lyrycist and producers.

There is no matter in which music genre I would work on - I think I'm kinda versatile.

And now, questions:

1) What city in the whole of the US offers the greatest opportunities for growth and engaging relationships that lead to broader collaboration and music industry presence ?

2) Can you recommend me places worth visiting, communities worth getting into, and career paths that I should take ?

3) How far today's realities are away from the romantic myth that if you want to make a success you just should come to a big city with good songs / ideas, knock to the door of a famous producer and start working with serious people on serious projects.

4) I've got songs to produce for other artists - what should be the next step / where I can send it to have a resoned hope someone will listening it and maybe someday give me a feedback.


5) Where I can find A&amp;R managers base and labels I can send my music to ?

6) What about SOUNDBETTER ? Does it really helpful to reach the people I could work with ?

Thanks in advance for any feedback !

5qcac9,1485459446.0,audioengineering,alexanderalright,What I learned from my first outside mastering experience,"Recent responses in another thread here made me want to post this. I hope it helps others in some way and also opens up a discussion because I could, of course, have done something differently or had the wrong expectations.  

1) I shouldn't have been desperate to hit a timeline. I read many articles that pinpointed 'ideal' release dates for new artists and became fixated on hitting a date. When many inquiries for mastering on sites like SoundBetter didn't get replies for months I got concerned and honestly paranoid - maybe my music was so terrible that people didn't even want to be paid to 'polish a turd'. Desperately wanting mastering put me at a disadvantage when I found someone who would work with me.  

2) I shouldn't have paid everything up front. Just like with major work on your house or car, I should have held money back as a final payment once I was totally happy with the product I was receiving. Maybe others with experience in the field will tell me this isn't how it's done or have more detail to add. 

3) I was asked to leave a review before two of the tracks I requested changes on were sent to me. I felt, perhaps incorrectly or just from paranoia, that he wouldn't have fixed the tracks without me leaving a higher rated review. I should have waited and been honest in my review. 

4) I should have asked for, even at additional cost, a review session. Or maybe that should have been included. Basically, he sent me a few tracks 'completed' but then listed all of the problems he had with them like conflicting bass in sections. If I would have known about that then I would have fixed it before he did all of the mastering, instead of sending him a revised file he expected to be paid a second time for mastering.  

5) For details/comparison for those getting quotes, I paid $1100 for mastering on 7 tracks. I'm generally happy with most of them, but the audio levels were not consistent across all tracks, and some key audio on some of them were turned down much much too low. I don't know if I over or under paid, but I do know that after contacting over 10 people about mastering, he's the only person who replied (he did have samples of his work and a website).  

Comments and feedback are greatly appreciated, as this was my first experience and I'm sure there are other things I could learn about this process.
