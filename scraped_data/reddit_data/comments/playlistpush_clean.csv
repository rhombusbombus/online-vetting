Also, lofi isnt getting that much attention. Even with big labels, they only do like 1 million streams; there isn’t a lofi “hits”. They are rare and few.

Lofi is literally background music. People just press play on a playlist and don’t care about the artist. Those at the top of the scene get millions of streams a month but necessarily won’t be actively followed like some artists who actually use vocals. Lofi artists can get good numbers via playlisting from labels but struggle REALLY hard to get a FOLLOWING; it is extremely dependent on label/playlist pushing",1.0,1.0,/r/musicians/comments/okwp74/is_anyone_using_spotify_discovery_mode/kqyngfg/,"That is not true at all.

I tried musosoup recently out of curiosity. You basically pay $30 to receive pitches from curators.

k5mpe4w,1697765486.0,musicmarketing,count_zackula,"I would say it depends what genre you’re releasing with - the editorial staff at DSPs like Apple and Spotify have changed drastically in the past year. Of course, it helps to have a label backing you (even small indie ones), as they often have connects at these DSPs and can get your song to the right ear. This is particularly how you see artists with little to no audience and nothing released get their first releases on editorials. 

That being said, I know people who’ve gotten placements on official playlists with self-released tracks just by pitching through Spotify for Artists (no equivalent for Apple yet). I can tell you with complete certainty that your profile on Spotify doesn’t matter all that much - the quality of your pictures, what you write in your bio, pretty much irrelevant. 

Your music counts. Make it good and release it as consistently as you can. When you’re pitching, give a good description of the track, say where you’re based, and feel free to suggest a couple of fitting playlists. 

Spotify used to be more of a level playing field. I remember when you could contact curators directly through google forms. Unfortunately not the case anymore, due both to over-saturation and a lot of major label involvement with DSPs. Not to mention them blindly favouring whatever is going viral on TikTok and Insta right now. 

Don’t sleep on indie playlists and blogs. I would not recommend sites like PlaylistPush or Groover (as someone who’s been a curator). Just not a fan, and seems pretty low value. Submithub works and is my favourite of these types of sites. Again, make sure your description and profile is up to date, and submit to the right places - blogs included. Write ups (and sites like Hype Machine) used to be more important, but they still hold some value. 

Best of luck, don’t stop what you’re doing just because of a lack of attention from Spotify and the like. This industry isn’t easy and thrives on personal connections. But it’s really about the music, don’t forget that.

I don't want this to be about charging artists as much as we can. It's expensive to be an artist today, and if I double prices I'm making that even worse. 

As for quality, do you mean ""more listeners""?  Because we put a lot of effort into the *quality* of our curators, and ensuring legitimate engagement. There are certainly some playlists that are bigger that aren't on our platforms, and that does indeed come down to $$$. But the difference between them and many of the curators on SubmitHub is that those big, expensive ones are obsessed with making more money, and we'd like to think our curators are paying more attention to actually curating high quality listening experiences.

All that is to say, you're right: if we increased prices a bunch, we'd get some of the ""big"" playlists. But many of this ""big"" playlists are doing sketchy stuff like selling placement, and I don't really want to work with them. Nor do I want to charge artists a lot more money.

jxr3zts,1693000526.0,musicmarketing,MysticCherryBlossom,"I haven't used playlistpush. 

I tried SubmitHub but only ever got rejected. I got tired of tracking down curators, listening to their playlists for like 30 minutes to make sure it was a good fit, writing a pitch to submit, and then still ultimately getting rejected so I decided I would just pay people to push my songs for me. No, I'm not talking about paying people to place me on a playlist (that's probably botted), but paying to have 3rd parties push my songs to legitimate curators.

So far, I have used YouGrow, Indie Music Academy, and Partnered Projects. There's dangers in using services like those too. In case you do decide to go this route:

YouGrow will 100% get you fast streams, but as someone mentioned, it was mostly Latin American streams, which probably fucked up my algorithm. You live and you learn right?

Indie Music Academy probably gave me the best results. I got on a great playlist, got some really good streams, got added to some other playlists from just being on that one, someone actually reached out to me on IG after finding me on this playlist, and I still get some streams on that song from people who found me on this playlist (not a lot but still more than any of my other songs). Couple of things about them though, they were only able to find placement for 1 of the 3 songs I submitted to them(refunds are guaranteed if they can't place you). And, it takes them fucking FOREVER to place you. Like, it took me weeks before they placed my 1 song, and then like a month or two before they told me they couldn't place me for the other 2. That's a LONG time. I didn't realize how long and thought this was normal until I tried Partnered Projects.

After Indie Music Academy kept being unable to place me, I tried Partnered Projects. They have somewhat of a co-sign from Andrew Southworth, so I figured they were probably legit. It only took them a few days to place me, and they were probably the best at actually placing me on RELEVANT playlists. The promotion I started with them is currently still running, so I am not sure how good the long term effects will be but I am happy enough with the results I want to use them again. In fact, probably going to use them for the song I just released AND the one after that. They also don't guarantee you placement, so they don't charge you until they have secured you a placement.

Anyway, paying for playlisting in anyway isn't a great idea (saying this as someone who does it) since as I mentioned it can fuck up your Spotify algo if you end up on the wrong playlists and also the long term benefits are questionable. While I got on some personal and smaller playlists from being on these paid playlists, I didn't gain any followers from it. So, lots of short term listeners, a few long term listeners of those particular songs, but no actual fans.

Only reason I still use this method is because this is the only method where I have seen SOME positive gains. I am currently promoting my new song harder than I have promoted ANY song ever (haven't paid to have it pitched for playlisting yet) by using ads on IG while also posting regularly on TikTok and YouTube. So far, the results have been abysmal (it's only been a week so far), so yeah...I can only do what I can until I start performing live, which will hopefully be the push I need to actually start gaining a following.

jrwii12,1689315207.0,makinghiphop,DJGrumbleOfficial,"What's up man. Kinda going backwards with my response, but what you're doing with the playlists is what I'm trying to do right now myself. That's one area I haven't really experimented with much until now. I've created a couple spotify playlists with mostly my production, and I'm working on getting people to save/follow them. I've never ran ads on social media but from what you described it seems like it can be cost effective. What I do is just pin a playlist to my Artist Pick and it picks up a few follows per day. My long-term goal is to get a few playlists with thousands of followers and then monetize them by becoming a playlist curator for PlaylistPush/SubmitHub/etc. As for your specific questions:

(1) I stuck with PlaylistPush just because that's the one I tried first based on reviews, and their playlists seem to be pretty high quality overall - no botted streams. I've made accounts with SubmitHub and SoundCamps but just never committed $$ to them. SoundCamps seemed like I was spending a LOT more to pitch to fewer playlists compared to PP.

(2) I kinda mix what I shop to rappers vs my self-published discography. Most of the stuff I shop for major label placements I keep off Spotify. I haven't run into any pitfalls as far as distributing the same beats that I shop to artists, BUT that's because I also don't use Content ID on anything. I deliberately keep everything out of Google/Meta Content ID because then everyone who uses a beat will start getting copyright strikes on YT/FB/IG etc. One of the main things that helped my beats go viral was YouTubers using my beats off SoundCloud in their videos. I allow all my beats to be downloaded for free and used with credit. I probably wouldn't be where I am today if I didn't have my whole catalog basically free on SoundCloud. When I sell a beat to a local/indie artist what they're essentially paying for is the extended HQ beat + stems.

(3) I think building playlists of your music is a great idea, as I discussed before, that's something I am working on. People tend to have short attention spans and usually can't be bothered to click through your discography and explore all of your releases in-depth. So putting your music in a more digestible format like a playlist I think would definitely improve your engagement and algorithmic scores.

My top-performing tracks on Spotify have popularity scores around 50%. In the last year or so, I've noticed a positive feedback loop occurring where my songs are heavily recommended to users in algorithmic playlists (mainly Radio), then they like/share/playlist the song, which causes the rank to go higher, which causes more engagement, etc. So I think I've finally got the sweet spot of Spotify popularity where the algorithm is recommending me to basically anyone listening to instrumental hip hop.

jrwgmdt,1689313900.0,makinghiphop,TapDaddy24,"Yo thank you a TON for giving such an in-depth response. This is really insightful hearing your budget, number of playlists, size of playlists, what you were targeting and how that worked in your successful early campaign. My wife and I have been really trying to dive into music marketing these past few months, trying to set up the momentum to hit algorithmic pushes on Spotify regularly.   


I have a few follow up questions you have time for em. And no worries at all if not.  


1) Have you tried other playlisting services such as SubmitHub / is there any particular reason why you use PlaylistPush?   


2) Do you distribute beats that you also sell or do you keep your discography separate from what you shop by rappers? Do you see any potential pitfalls for distributing beats for instrumental listening while also selling licensing on them to rappers?  


3) Do you think consistent algorithmic push could be achieved through investing in building deep playlists of only your music? I suppose successful examples of this would be Lofi Girl or organizations like ChillHop Music, Fantastic FM, and JazzHop Cafe. Do you see any pros or cons to chasing that sort of advertising model?  


I know these are kinda specific questions but I'd be very curious to hear your perspective. I have 295 beats distributed on platforms right now. I am also selling licenses to all of them on BeatStars. I really don't see many producers doing that, and so I'm curious if I am somehow shooting myself in the foot by also offering artists an accessible way to obtain permissions to these beats which they may be hearing on my Spotify.   


As you may have guessed, we are chasing a bit of a Lofi Girl, ChillHop Music, etc., type model where we are investing in Instagram ads (via facebook ad manager), and growing instrumental playlists which only contain my productions and collabs. We have been running very small campaigns ($100-$250) for the past 3 &amp;1/2 months. Through these ads, we've managed to find a few tracks that are getting pretty damn good costs per conversion (at least I think so, compared to all of the numbers in the tutorials we've been watching). Our most popular playlist is our ""Jazzy HipHop"" playlist which has gotten over 1000 saves with about $250-$350ish spent in advertising for it. I've currently got 1800 monthlies and we haven't hit any significant algorithmic push yet, though I'm hoping to make that leap soon. I've hit a a decent release radar push in the past without any advertising. Now, with some new releases that came out during the start of this last campaign, I've now got a few tracks approaching a spotify popularity score of about 20%. I predict that we might be able to hit a push with one or two more campaigns if we really go for it on the right releases with the right playlist. Guess we'll see.

jrwbnbz,1689310657.0,makinghiphop,DJGrumbleOfficial,"No problem. The keys to success with playlisting services, in my experience, are the following:

(1) the music has to be good! playlist curators are picky. you can burn your whole budget and get no placements if you submit something they don't like. if you submit something wack, there is zero point to doing playlist pitching. so I only pitched my absolute strongest tracks that I knew had broad appeal. which leads me to the next point:

(2) target your genres well. don't just submit to ""hip hop"" and ""rap"" playlists, find every possible subgenre that could apply to your track and pitch to those playlists as well. also look up the names of subgenres in other languages (spanish, french etc) and submit to those so you can get the international audience.

(3) put a good budget behind it. $1000-1500 on PlaylistPush would usually get the results I was looking for. For that price I would usually get about 50 playlist adds, with each playlist having anywhere between 5,000-100,000 followers on average. I was targeting \~100,000 streams in the initial 3-6 months after the campaign with an eventual goal of 1M streams, which pays for the campaign at that point. So really you're giving the track a good initial ""shove"" to where it starts organically gaining traction just by more people engaging with and sharing the music.

A couple examples of tracks that I promoted with PlaylistPush

Blake Anthony - Flaus (2019) - 3.3M plays

Blake Anthony - Flawless (2019) - 3.1M plays

Kam Robinson - Drink More Water (2020) - 1.4M plays

Kam Robinson - How u feel (2019) - 1.2M plays

The initial playlist campaign on the above tracks has continued to pay off as they remain popular and generate significant income. And as I alluded to, not every campaign is a slam dunk. Some tracks do better than others, but that's just the music biz in general. You win some and lose some.

The initial playlist campaign on the above tracks has continued to pay off as they remain popular and generate significant income. And as I alluded to, not every campaign is a slam dunk.

The keys to success with playlisting services, in my experience, are the following (1) the music has to be good! playlist curators are picky. you can burn your whole budget and get no placements if you submit something they don't like. if you submit something wack, there is zero point to doing playlist pitching. so I only pitched my absolute strongest tracks that I knew had broad appeal. which leads me to the next point (2) target your genres well. don't just submit to ""hip hop"" and ""rap"" playlists, find every possible subgenre that could apply to your track and pitch to those playlists as well. also look up the names of subgenres in other languages (spanish, french etc) and submit to those so you can get the international audience. (3) put a good budget behind it. $1000-1500 on PlaylistPush would usually get the results I was looking for. For that price I would usually get about 50 playlist adds, with each playlist having anywhere between 5,000-100,000 followers on average. I was targeting \~100,000 streams in the initial 3-6 months after the campaign with an eventual goal of 1M streams, which pays for the campaign at that point.

* These sites are essentially MLM for music.
   * You pay someone who sends your songs to a playlist organizer who gets paid to put a song on for two weeks.
* These playlists are passive. Passive is the key word here, meaning: people don't pay attention - it's background music. Yes you get a stream, but people are listening because it's called ""Cozy Cafe Vibes"" - they don't care about WHO, it's just a vibe for the background at a low volume.
* You have no control over where your music is grouped
   * They can throw you in any shitty genre playlist to ""fulfill"" your ""catered"" payment plan - have you ever listened to what you get accepted to? Generally it's trash, poorly mixed, poorly produced, etc.

SubmitHub likely will not get you anything crazy, it's a huge soul sucker and waste of time and money imo (2500 streams for $100?)

Imo **put that money into Google Ads for your music on YouTube**. In comparison, 2500 streams would cost about $30-40, depending on these factors:

* You can determine **exactly** which artists, songs, keywords, genres, etc. you want to have ads alongside. And it will **only** show your music to those results.
* You have complete control over how much money is spent and where
   * for example: it may be $.50 per stream but to your exact audience in an influential major city, or $.05 per stream in a less populated place - you get to choose which ""listener"" is more important for your money).

jegrxk8,1680300977.0,musicproduction,TheDarkPhilosopher,"Not really. I’ve just run my “biggest” Groover campaign. I’ve run numerous campaigns with them. Last campaign was about $500 and resulted in less than 2,000 plays. This campaign was about $500 (maybe $400 with some of the discounts?) and…the results are terrible. The song was accepted on many playlists. I think it’s in the ballpark of 80-100 playlists. The vast majority of these playlists aren’t fake or real—they’re simply “dead.” I noticed curators on Groover (and SubmitHub) will join the site by submitting a major playlist (say, 10-20k followers). Then they’ll create smaller playlists with a few hundred dead followers (likely other artists who already submitted songs and were instructed to “follow playlist and stream it”). This is how you end up with an ecosystem that’s so ubiquitous now: tons and tons of playlist “curators” accepting songs that get nearly zero streams. This has happened to me *repeatedly*. Even when you get a “top curator” to accept your track, it rarely ends up on their “top playlist.” As I’ve said before, it’ll likely end up on their dead playlist. I say “dead” and not “fake” even though, at this point, it’s best to just call this scheme what it is: deceptive. And since it’s deceptive, it’s also fraudulent. Hence “fake” may be the appropriate term here. (“Fake” because you are led to believe a top curator with 10-20k follower Spotify playlist accepted your song when in reality that’s not what happened, and that’s far from what’s actually going on at Groover and SubmitHub.) 

I’ve run numerous campaigns on SubmitHub and can attest to it having a much lower acceptance rate than Groover with equally bad (if not worse) results. I don’t even know if I’ve managed to get a 1000 streams using SubmitHub from 20-30 playlist placements—it’s truly that atrocious. 

My music is also professionally produced, mixed, and mastered. (Our two studios have north of $300,000 of equipment between them—with all the standard stuff like 251s, 47s, 67s, hand-built 0.8 micron ribbon mics [$8k a piece], 1073s, 1176s, etc., etc. You get the point.) There’s nothing a major studio has that we don’t. Other than a Steinway piano, maybe.

Having said all that, I’ve run over $10k worth of PlaylistPush campaigns and can say that while the rejection rate is high on there (most will reject your song), if you get on any of their playlists, they’re the real deal. Your song will get tens of thousands of real streams and organic growth. That’s the positive answer to the eternal question all of us musicians ask ourselves: what to do? 

Having said *that*, I will also point out that even PlaylistPush had a playlist or two that used bots. (Which I obviously reported.) Bots are, more or less, everywhere.

icg2ids,1655295255.0,musicmarketing,SideDownRecordings,"I used Drop last month after receiving multiple (very convincing) promo mails from Andrew. 

Here's my thoughts:

PROS:

\- They did what they said they were going to do. My song was accepted by 4 playlists and reached 114,000 followers, and I received an email whenever the song was added to a list

\- The playlists look genuine based on Soundcharts data and my own research (curators had social media profiles, lots of Spotify profile followers etc)

\-  I received around 8k streams, just under 200 saves and a handful of follows. I'll let you make your own mind up on whether that's worth $200+, but I was happy enough with the results

CONS:

\- Customer support was slow and there is no # number, just email tickets. I did get a response to every email I sent, but at times I was waiting 2-3 days for a reply. In their defense my queries weren't super important, but if you do need to speak to someone urgently I wouldn't hold my breathe for an instant response

\- If you use them, expect to be hammered with promo emails afterwards. I don't want to unsubscribe as I will most likely use one of their offers again at some point, but it would be nice if there was an option to receive less emails rather than 2-3 per week

Overall I had a pretty positive experience and I will probably run another campaign on one my next releases. But just like PlaylistPush, SubmitHub etc I think success on these platforms really depends on how good your music is and how well it fits with their playlists.

hwxlqo4,1644860930.0,musicmarketing,Evening-Border-6081,"Please post a website link to this ""consultant"" (or PM it to me).  I actually have a few ears at Spotify and they really hate third-party consultants. 

Exact same thing happened to me and I've actually made a few inroads with artist support.  I got over 1,000 fake followers and over 15,000 streams and over 1,000 song saves in one week and it completely blew apart my ""Listeners also like"" to artists who really suck and have 0 to 10 listeners per month.  This happened to me the beginning of October 2020 and in January Spotify finally removed over 1,000 followers after months of badgering on my part, and scolding on their part over using the clown I hired to ""promote"" my music.  I'm still trying to get them to remove over 1,000 song saves and the 15,000 streams to no avail.  They now they limit artists from seeing song saves to just 28 days, so I can't tell if they did anything.  

I had a really good back and forth with artist support in December on deleting my ""radio"" and ""also like"" sections, which they could do for me, but he advised against it because it may take a long time to get those back (if ever).  When I told him that I plan on pitching a new single release every 4 weeks this year and at least 2 full albums from my backlog as well, he advised me to hang in there and things will eventually correct themselves.  He also explained that the algorithm draws for several different areas in no particular order:

1. Monthly Listeners
2. Song saves to listener ratio
3. Song streams to listener ratio
4. Quality of streams (Tier 1 countries matter the most)
5. % of streams from your profile
6. % of streams coming from listeners' libraries &amp; personal playlists 
7. % of streams coming from listeners' public playlists
8. % of streams from Spotify algorithmic playlists
9. % of Spotify editorial playlists - the first 8 areas factor in to varying degrees for this, along with the song quality, performance &amp; production

I've released 2 songs so far (Dec &amp; Jan) with the next one coming at the end of Feb.  Good news is a couple decent artists finally came back to my ""also like"" section about a month ago.   I've tried facebook ads and they suck for me and my demographic (70s singer-songwriter/Classic Rock) 55+ folks don't do a lot of streaming.  I've also tried out PlaylistPush and Omari MC - and most of the streams came from South America on mostly bullshit playlists that have all of these shitty artists who are also paying for streams.  You'll get streams but the majority of the listeners will not listen to your music again.  No saves either.  But you'll get streams lol.

I actually have a few ears at Spotify and they really hate third-party consultants.  Exact same thing happened to me and I've actually made a few inroads with artist support.  I got over 1,000 fake followers and over 15,000 streams and over 1,000 song saves in one week and it completely blew apart my ""Listeners also like"" to artists who really suck and have 0 to 10 listeners per month.  This happened to me the beginning of October 2020 and in January Spotify finally removed over 1,000 followers after months of badgering on my part, and scolding on their part over using the clown I hired to ""promote"" my music.  I'm still trying to get them to remove over 1,000 song saves and the 15,000 streams to no avail.  They now they limit artists from seeing song saves to just 28 days, so I can't tell if they did anything.   I had a really good back and forth with artist support in December on deleting my ""radio"" and ""also like"" sections, which they could do for me, but he advised against it because it may take a long time to get those back (if ever).  When I told him that I plan on pitching a new single release every 4 weeks this year and at least 2 full albums from my backlog as well, he advised me to hang in there and things will eventually correct themselves.  He also explained that the algorithm draws for several different areas in no particular order 1. Monthly Listeners 2. Song saves to listener ratio 3. Song streams to listener ratio 4. Quality of streams (Tier 1 countries matter the most) 5. % of streams from your profile 6. % of streams coming from listeners' libraries & personal playlists  7. % of streams coming from listeners' public playlists 8. % of streams from Spotify algorithmic playlists 9. % of Spotify editorial playlists - the first 8 areas factor in to varying degrees for this, along with the song quality, performance & production I've released 2 songs so far (Dec & Jan) with the next one coming at the end of Feb.  Good news is a couple decent artists finally came back to my ""also like"" section about a month ago.   I've tried facebook ads and they suck for me and my demographic (70s singer-songwriter/Classic Rock) 55 folks don't do a lot of streaming.  I've also tried out PlaylistPush and Omari MC - and most of the streams came from South America on mostly bullshit playlists that have all of these shitty artists who are also paying for streams.  You'll get streams but the majority of the listeners will not listen to your music again.  No saves either.  But you'll get streams lol.

To answer your questions: I make a playlist for several reasons, which is why I also want a perfect name for my playlist.   
  
First, I am very passionate with music. Especially Hiphop/rap and believe it or not underground techno (I live in Belgium and here techno is very in). music is like many something to isolate myself.   
Many 25+ (I'm not talking about you!) will not understand my taste in hip hop as many modern rap are less appreciated by ""older"" people.   
  
As such, I have received a lot of negative feedback on the playlist(name) when I promoted it on hip hop reddit pages. Nevertheless, I have a lot of understanding of the latest hip/hop and follow it hard.  
 In addition, I am personally making Hip/hop as an artist. a great playlist boosts a small individual artist directly.   
  
In addition, I know there is a big market for the music in the playlist. Rap/hip and pop are the biggest music genres and very much in with the youth (14-25). Still where I live, assume it's the same in the US.  
  
I also did my homework on how to make money with a more popular playlist. There are websites like playlistpush that will give you money if you have a good playlist. (For more info you should look it up as it is quite a process). In addition, the playlist can also work with placements, where artists pay a little to be on the playlist.  
The best way to make great playlist (in terms of followers) are ads. I am also willing to do that once my playlist preparation is done.

gzg697i,1621983905.0,musicmarketing,76-IL,"Hey,

it will be really hard to do that as you have more eyes on social media, but its still possible

in case you want to do other stuff here is some ideas:

1. Collaborate with other artists that already have a little more monthly listeners than you have.
2. offline - print stickers with Spotify QR code that send them to listen to your music and put the stickers where you think is your audiences are
3. Playlisting - one of the best ways to get real streams and to trigger the algorithm of Spotify is playlisting, there are a lot of services like submit hub and playlistpush.  
I like to use [PlaylistMap.com](https://PlaylistMap.com) because you can find specific playlists by search artists that similar to you and pitch your song to the playlist curator, They also have a free plan..
4. Youtube ads - run some ads on youtube target only channels of musicians that sound like you with a teaser of the best part of your song
5. Email marketing - if you collect a lot of emails you can send them the direct link to your song on the day of the release, which will help you to boost steams",2.0,,/r/musicmarketing/comments/nkf0rc/ways_to_market_your_music_without_social_media/gzg697i/,"Hey, it will be really hard to do that as you have more eyes on social media, but its still possible in case you want to do other stuff here is some ideas 1.

gslmu26,1616953826.0,MusicPromotion,andreas_sundberg78,"Thanx for a good and interesting answer! I will try to give my best to answer the two main things that got most of my attention from your post:

Regarding using PlaylistPush for promoting songs I haven't tried that myself but seen how serious and professional they are from the other side (the curator side) I think this could be beneficial, and I will def try it out for my next release. I get a lot of songs sent to me that I review, and every time I hear a song that really rocks out, and has the right mood I absolutely add it to my list - so if I do it I am sure a lot of other curators there are also doing that. But the key here is: you must have GREAT songs, and also really good production. I think a lot if Indie artists fail here (especially when it comes to quality of production..). But that said you have tried that part of the process more then me, so I can't say so much more except it still is something I want to give a shot at..

Reagarding the other thing, the referral code, that is absolutely 100% real. Every curator gets one and you just copy it from your referrals- page. Then if some people post ""fake"" codes I cannot tell - but why would anyone do that? The whole purpose of these codes is they are linked to you so PP can see you are using them. And I mean there's not really any risk in trying the code. If it works you get a disocount, if it was fake you will get an error message when pasting it in your campaign - and then you probably don't move on :) hope this gives some clarity - and really wish you the best luck with your promotion wether you use PP or some other platform!

gqdw0yp,1615331261.0,spotify,TheRealKaiLord,"my g, I'm real deep in the indie hip hop realm. spotify editorials you can't get pay to be on. spotify editorial staff picks, the closest to paying to be on an official one would be if you're from a huge label that has direct connections to spotify's editorial staff. no random person can do that.

indie artists are virtually invisible. there are many playlists that take submissions for free, but your chances of being heard/placed are hella low for any of them with significant plays.

then there are shit a shit ton of pseudo pay to place, like submithub and playlistpush, you pay to be considered by a huge amount of playlists and the playlists make a little bit of money to listen to your submission.

then of course, if a random individual puts their contact info in their playlist, you might be able to reach out to them directly and ask to be on their playlist.

even after all of this, any of those playlists may have bot follows and bot plays, spotify doesn't crack down on it cuz it doesn't affect their bottom line.

the playlist world is very difficult to navigate.

this playlist represent a small niche, LO-NY/Renaissance/Splayed, it has a couple different names. It is distinctly inspired by Some Rap Songs by Earl, the works of the sLUms collective and MAVI and some other folks. It is curated by hand, I know most of the people on it personally, they are from all over the US and the world, all of them are slept on like crazy, most are on very few playlists, and certainly even fewer with power. we will never accept money. and we will never over represent any artist and we will never place artists who are already popping or famous. this is for the under the underground in our niche.

if you run ads:

* change your campaign goal on “clicks” 
* create different content videos and test them
* run the ads on News feed
* make sure you send them directly to the song URL
* i think it's better showing the ads only to mobile users...

you also should consider playlisting for the songs

&gt;  
&gt;First of all, I build an organic playlist with real followers. As I am an artist as well, I could see that I was getting a lot of streams from my own playlist.

&gt;Unfortunately Playlist Push had a bug on my account. It showed that my playlist does not get any plays. I contacted the support and they provided me with screenshots, that I was actually getting decent interaction. They were quite surprised as well about this.

fmbrusi,1585932062.0,LofiHipHop,highschoolgirlfriend,"How long have you been producing ?  If you've just recently started, a few months maybe, then your main priority should be making good music.  I hate to say it (i don't hate to say it actually), I'm just gonna be real upfront about this, you have to actually make good music before bloggers and playlisters even consider you.  even once you ARE making genuinely good sounding music, you're probably going to be rejected or ignored by 90%+ of the bloggers/playlisters that you submit to.

This is also just another fact of life, if you've been producing for a few months, then you suck.  From an audio point of view, your mixes are going to be garbage.  And you know what?  That is fantastic.  Sucking at something is the best way to learn how to not suck at something anymore.  If you want to get yourself out there in music then you have my full support, but make sure you're getting your hours in before you expect any kind of payoff.  I've been producing for six years and I just now recently started publishing music.  And I still suck at mixing lmao.  You do not have to wait that long haha and I actually do not recommend it, I screwed myself out of a lot of time learning about the marketing side of music, but just get to the point where your music sounds good before you start to market yourself.

Now, if you have been doing this for a while and your mixes sound good, or if you just really insist on getting bad sounding music sent out, go on all the music subreddits you can find that match your genre.  there should be a ton of people on there posting their playlists.  feel free to drop a comment just asking ""hey, are you taking submissions for your playlist?""  this is seriously one of the best ways to do it, I kid you not.  Also, if you're willing to shell out a bit of cash, [submithub](https://www.submithub.com/) is pretty easy and reliable.  and if you've just got money flowing out of your ass whenever you go to take a dump, i would even recommend [playlistpush](https://playlistpush.com/).  But you don't get as many placements (in my experience, at least) from these paid services as you would by just asking people posting their playlists on subreddits, since the paid services are usually blogs that are making money off of their aggregation services and they tend to be pretty picky about what they let on their playlists.  People posting their playlists on subreddits are nine times out of ten just regular old joe schmoes.  and i don't mean that as an insult if it sounds like one, i actually like working with those people a lot.  they're just regular old dudes that have a playlist.

And I can not stress this enough, beware of the [dunning kruger effect](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/dunning-kruger-effect).  This applies to any new skill you learn, but especially with music.  the article is worded just a little bit r/iamverysmart like, but it's basically saying that it's when you're good enough at something to know what you're good at, but not good enough to know what you're bad at.

fhrug9n,1581839299.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,jason-at-giflike,"Hey, SubmitHub founder here, so I'll try to be factual and not-so-biased, but I've clearly got some strong opinions :)


**Groover**

* Pretty much exactly the same as SubmitHub but focused on the French market.  
* It has a lot of the same blogs/playlists as SubmitHub (because they've systematically gone through our list and tried to sign them up).
* It costs EUR2 per submission, which is more than SubmitHub
* Their feature set is far less robust than SubmitHub's (I'm biased of course, but I've been coding daily on SubmitHub for 4+ years, and they're basically 1-year-old, so they've got a ton of lessons to learn about how to manage the submission process).
* So basically... a new competitor trying to copy the SubmitHub model, but with a long road ahead of them. Because they're less-known, you might have some success on there as there are fewer artists to compete against.

**PlaylistPush**

* Focused entirely on Spotify playlists.
* They have a minimum spend of $250.
* They provide a much more hand-held experience than SubmitHub. For example, they choose who to send your song to instead of you choosing. Some people might like this, as it's one of the more-involved parts of using SubmitHub. Personally, I'd argue that getting to choose who you spend your money sending songs to is certainly more transparent.
* A lot of their playlists are the same as those on SubmitHub, but cost significantly more. For example, Island Beats on SubmitHub costs 3 credits or ~$2.40 (our highest price tier), but on PlaylistPush I think they get paid $10+ for each song they consider. This has the disadvantage of being way more expensive, but... the flip side is that PlaylistPush has a higher approval rate. This is likely because there are fewer artists/submissions to compete against.
* It's also rumoured that PlaylistPush actually own a number of the playlists on their platform, which might be a bit of a conflict of interest -- it allows them to approve songs so that artists feel like they got some results.
* I don't think PlaylistPush has a way of tracking whether curators actually listen to your song or not, so it's possible for them to decline a song without ever actually hitting play. Maybe they've fixed this recently, but... yeah. Spotify doesn't allow streaming outside of Spotify, so I'm not sure how they'd get around that easily.
* Ultimately, they're still one of the only Spotify-specific playlist promo services you can sorta-kinda-trust. There are so many others out there running straight up scams, and PlaylistPush isn't one of those.

Ultimately this is a whole new area of music promotion, replacing an industry that was formerly dominated by publicity companies that charged $1,500+ per month for a similar service. SubmitHub's the most-popular and feature-rich of the available platforms out there. That popularity also means that you're competing against a lot more artists.

luckily for you I've saved the thread, look for: 

""SubmiHub and PlaylistPush - Extensive Review and Comparison - My experience and results - Why they are not a scam""

What kind of music are you making?

As for not finding enough playlist curators, I can tell you only about my own experience as submitter.

Yes, there seems to be quite a difference between the outlets you get shown, when you use only the free credits versus the paid ones.

But for most it makes sense, as they ask for three credits, so you will never get them displayed, with just 2 standard / free credits. Also, as a ""receiver"" you can chose to just get paid submissions, so these you also will not see with just standard credits. Besides that, I have the feeling there is an algorithm or something at work, which checks how much you have tried to submit a certain song with standard credits, but I cannot prove that. 

Anyway, if you wanna use submithub to its fullest potential, I guess you will need to buy a few credits, to take full advantage of it.

And read the very thourough post (see above) as this guy really reseached his receiver targets and wrote about this in great detail. I would advise you to do the same to get the most out of your credits.

Let me know if you have any further questions. My receiving account on Submithub is ""Radio Dark Tunnel (Shellshocked Radio)"", if you wanna check it.

I have had a playlist on submithub, and I took it down because it didn't feel like the right thing to do for my playlist. In the end, it's really not for the artists - it's for the playlist curators.

When it comes to listens, the bigger the playlist the smaller the engagement rate.  
More so, many big playlists use follow gates - ***they force the artist to follow / like them before submitting his music***. This creates a huge gap between followers and listeners.   


I found a small trick to find quality Spotify playlists, it's slightly technical but worth it IMO.  


1. open spotify on your desktop.
2. open google chrome inspect (on mac cmd+shift+c)
3. find artist that is similar to you style wise and has 10 times your followers.
4. click his about page. for [example](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7cu3oi92lUe550VejeSeP3/about) 
5. go to the Networks tab in inspect and search urls that match *spclient.wg.spotify.com/open-backend-2/v1/artists*
6. click on it, you'll now see four tabs: headers, preview, response, timing. click on **preview**
7. click on '**artistInsights**' and click '**playlists**' 

You can see the top playlists this artist is discovered on WITH THE NUMBER OF MONTHLY LISTENERS FROM IT!   
`""name"": ""Berlin Electronic Underground"", ""owner"": { ""name"": ""xburglarcatx"", ""uri"": ""spotify:user:xburglarcatx"" }, ""listeners"": 127`

&amp;#x200B;

Now start hunting these curators down, they might be available through submission sites like [submithub](https://submithub.com), [mysphera](https://mysphera.co) or [playlistpush](https://playlistpush.com).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So for the next album thats coming in couple of month I decided so far:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- start with single video with proper animation or real video, as apetizer  
&gt;  
&gt;\- within a month a second single, to keep the hunger  
&gt;  
&gt;\- soon after launch of the album but with more modern ""stills"" then I already did.

This alone makes it infinitely better than 90% of the ways you send your music out into the void from emails to blog posts, because while you can know how many people listened (the play count on your soundcloud), you don't know WHO listened. Most music that's sent out never even gets considered by influencers, let alone makes it to enough ears in the market place to live or die on its own merit.   


As for the rest of them, depends how much money you have to burn. Playlistpush resulted in quite a bit of feedback, but the ratio of ""Love it, but not for my list"" to actual Playlist acceptance makes me wonder how well the pools you pay to submit into are curated.   


That story accelerates vastly when you bring in specific pushers. Note MOST publicists don't do specific User generated playlists, and definitely don't do Spotify internal. Spotify internal is all a game between connected people (ala the management mentioned in another response), distributors (but not like Tunecore, CDbaby, etc), and the algorithm. Playlist ads and listener to save ratios are a big trigger for those supposedly. Yes you can submit via the Artist dashboard now, but I'll standby for any case studies of it actually resulting in editorial playlisting.   


If you KNOW your stuff is good, and have the budget and the confidence to see if you are right, start with Submit hub making sure you know you are sending it to the right people. If that shows great results, I'd recommend stepping it up by pushing music videos directly to listeners via Facebook or Youtube ads. I'm not going to go through the how, but you should target fans/listeners of bands that you think their fans would like your stuff.   


If you get good results from that, then worry about finding management because you've either got to be remarkably talented raw potential, or bringing demonstrable value (which we can all see via your Spotify play trending, or these ad metrics) to convince someone to work with you who is any good on essentially long term commission.

kaa1e5w,1700643330.0,musicmarketing,Krimshaw_42,"So my personal biggest takeaway is unfortunately not a great one.  I think when I started a few years ago I saw more hope than I do now for indie artists, but there's still some good news as well.  A lot of the bad news is related and it boils down to a few things. 

- All Social Media has become hostile to creators / artists.  They have suppressed their algorithms.  Organic reach is nearly impossible.  This is not by accident.  They want you to buy Ads.  They need you to buy Ads because they're publicly traded companies who need to generate more and more revenue.  That's just how the market works.  They start cool and artist friendly (TikTok) - then they get a critical mass of users and start going way too heavy on monetization, effectively ruining what made the platform cool.   So it's not your imagination.  The deck is increasingly stacked against you.  Right now there are no artist friendly platforms. None.  Zero.   Threads could change that if they get hashtags and DMs going.  Until then they are a non factor.

Spotify and YouTube.  You need to understand these are not profitable businesses.  So while yes, they are not paying artists hardly anything, they aren't turning a profit either.  Streaming is not a good business model.  You have to remember that for 10 years all content was effectively being stolen on Torrents and Limewire and before that Napster.  Piracy wiped out the traditional music industry completely.  Streaming is an attempt to bring it back but even big artists are not making bank and neither is Spotify.  The money is in having fans.  Fans that pay to see you live.  Buy merch (although the overhead on that is not great, until you're moving huge amounts of it).  So realistically the game is this, get fans and play live shows - or sell them stuff.  Physical Media, or Merch if you don't plan on playing live.  Or you could go the influencer / Podcaster route.

That being said - Spotify still has a HUGE market share of streaming activity AND presents a massive opportunity to reach fans anywhere in the world.  This is the good news.  It's a global market!  When you dig into the data on Chart Metric - most of the biggest streaming markets are in Latin America.  They LOVE music down there and the currency exchange rate is extremely favorable. 

So, if you have a small marketing budget, I would honestly put it towards Spanish language Ads in Central and South America and also Portuguese Ads in Brazil. 

Then, very important, I would familiarize yourself with Google Translate.  This is the part of the job I enjoy most.  The most important thing you can do to turn a casual listener into a fan is actually very simple. 

Talk to them.  Technology is now a great tool and without speaking a word of Spanish you can have a full conversation with someone in Guatemala.  Who will actually be grateful to hear from you.  And you'll learn about other countries and their culture. Their perspectives.  And your money will go infinitely further than trying to compete in the oversaturated and incredibly expensive to advertise in Primary Markets that everyone is always advertising in.  You can also learn how to run ads for $1 / day until you get better at it and then apply what you've learned to the major markets. 

Other than that, the biggest thing I would suggest is having a decent playlisting budget.  Spotify claims payola isn't allowed but that is an outright lie.  Every decent playlist wants money or a paid service to reach the curators and Spotify does not enforce their policies AT ALL.  There are some free resources to help with playlists, and sure, you can spend all day pitching, but you won't move the needle without money.  Why is playlisting important?  If done correctly it will train the algorithm to recommend your song to the right people.  And that is when Spotify starts working for you, not against you.  You must pitch the right songs to the right playlists though. Really know your genre, sub-genre, mood, activity, target audience.  (Gym / Workout playlists are popular for example.  Summer Playlists.   Chill Playlists.  Driving Playlists.)  You need to know the playlisting landscape. There's over FOUR BILLION playlists on Spotify!  And very few good ones!

Free Playlist Services:
Soundplate.Com
DailyPlaylists.Com

Good Subscription Services:

Artist.Tools (most valuable because they have a bot vetting service that is very helpful)
Playlist Supply
Playlist Hunter

SubmitHub is good for hitting up a few dozen curators and maybe some influencer placements if you're on a budget.  $100 worth of credits can get you meaningful results

Playlist Push is probably the best premium service - starts at $297 though - goes up to $5k campaigns

Indie Music Academy also starts at $297 - if you just wanna get in some big playlists, guaranteed streams and juice your numbers, they start at 10k guaranteed streams

Then after that there's a bunch of smaller players or ones I've not read good reviews on that I wouldn't use

My artists I've worked with have small and tight budgets, and are self financing their careers, so we're always looking to stretch every dollar far as we can so I just thought that might help some of you out and answer some questions.  I'm happy to answer any specific questions but that's kind of the main overview of what I've learned in a couple years in this crazy ""business""

Long live independent music!

Screw the corporate gatekeepers and the big money keeping all you talented mofos down!

🎶Namaste🎶",1.0,1.0,/r/musicmarketing/comments/1814tk8/my_quick_overview_of_the_music_marketing/kaa1e5w/,"So my personal biggest takeaway is unfortunately not a great one.  I think when I started a few years ago I saw more hope than I do now for indie artists, but there's still some good news as well.  A lot of the bad news is related and it boils down to a few things.   All Social Media has become hostile to creators / artists.  They have suppressed their algorithms.  Organic reach is nearly impossible.  This is not by accident.  They want you to buy Ads.  They need you to buy Ads because they're publicly traded companies who need to generate more and more revenue.  That's just how the market works.  They start cool and artist friendly (TikTok) - then they get a critical mass of users and start going way too heavy on monetization, effectively ruining what made the platform cool.   So it's not your imagination.  The deck is increasingly stacked against you.  Right now there are no artist friendly platforms. None.  Zero.   Threads could change that if they get hashtags and DMs going.  Until then they are a non factor. Spotify and YouTube.  You need to understand these are not profitable businesses.  So while yes, they are not paying artists hardly anything, they aren't turning a profit either.  Streaming is not a good business model.  You have to remember that for 10 years all content was effectively being stolen on Torrents and Limewire and before that Napster.  Piracy wiped out the traditional music industry completely.

k2gmnd8,1695836997.0,musicmarketing,wolflikeme23,"Hi Geoff,

Years ago we set out to create an efficient promotion network that could get your music to thousands of curators in a few clicks. Its pretty simple: if you have budget use Playlist Push, if you have time use SubmitHub.

Your concerns about the cost of promotion are valid. It's a challenging space, and there's room for improvement. Ideally, platforms should find a balance between transparency and compensation for both artists and curators. Unfortunately you get what you pay for if you are utilizing cheap services. In a direct to submission model the company itself holds very little accountability for the results you end up with...  
We are always trying to increase transparency and provide as much data and info to help artists effectively manage campaigns. Artists should have a clearer understanding of where their money is going and who's considering their music.  
Quality vs. Quantity: Finding the right playlist or curator can make a world of difference. It's not just about the quantity of streams but also the quality of engagement and the potential for genuine fan connections. We have extensive tools that weed out bad playlists and only sign up curators with fresh listeners and solid engagement. 

If you had a bad experience with Playlist Push please message me I would be happy to look at your campaign and see what I can do to help you out!  

If you want more detail on Playlist Push vs SH just google it and DYOR. Both services hold a vital place in the music promotion space.
