iei3smu,1656710716.0,Blogging,FixSoft9735,"I know that earlier you said that you are interested in music, and have a blog where you share songs you discovered and fallen in love with and since your main focus right now is getting traffic…what I say from my experience is this:


There are 2 types of blogs/blogging styles which are personal blogs and business blogs.

Business blogs are intended to bring value, solve problems, or provide information for those who are in need. These are the blogs that usually get more traffic, money, and are just generally bigger.

Personal blogs are blogs that are usually done in one’s self interest, which kinda trades in the more traffic/having a bigger website for something you want to simply do for fun as a hobby/or for self enjoyment.

The bright side to this is that people usually merge the 2—personal-business blogs—people take a niche that interests them a lot and find out some way it can provide value to people that need help. With that being said…

From what I’ve seen, music blogs typically fall into 2 categories:

&gt; Newscasting/music scene reporting such as:
&gt; pitchfork, popjustice, xxlmag, elevatormag, genius

Or

&gt; Musician help, such as:
&gt; omarimc, smartrapper 


Newscasting/music scene blogs are usually blogs that are fixated on a certain scene in music or that are just focused on reporting news in that scene/genre.

Musician help blogs are pretty self explanatory, they’re usually blogs that provide guidance and assistance to upcoming musicians that need it. They do this by providing reviews, answering questions in their articles, and all other sorts of things.

There can also be a blog that combines both of these types of music blogs. And how these blogs generate traffic is the same to how every other blog generates traffic which is:

&gt; mastering SEO and optimizing it the best you can in your articles and in your website

&gt; through social media (Pinterest in typically the best social media for blogs from what I’ve seen)

&gt;  trying your best to get your websites ranked in googles front pages (by increasing domain authority)

&gt; constantly learning and finding out better ways of expanding your website and increasing its traffic from more experienced people

&gt; consistency lmao (1 post a week, or 2 posts a week, or 1 post a day, or even 2 posts a day, so long as you’re getting out at least 1-3 articles a week Google will slowly recognize you more, and traffic will pick up)

&gt; patience, raising a blog is kind of like raising a child, it takes anywhere from 6 months to 3 years for a blog to start doing things. But also never be afraid to cut off a blog that you feel has no potential.


I also highly advise you to read up and watch videos about people who make blogs and are experienced at it (on YouTube, Reddit, Google, etc.) it really helps you to do better in blogging.

Mr. Osse,

What does loyalty look like to you?  Is it the fulfillment of a promised number of minutes? Is it a long tenure and proven commitment to a single program? Is it a contract extension that will secure your coach throughout the duration of your college career?

All of these things are perfectly serviceable, and even noble, displays of loyalty.  Any coach worth his salt should be able to demonstrate these points. I certainly do.

But they don’t really differentiate any of NCBCA’s score of nominally loyal coaches.  They, frankly, don’t require much active effort.

But I’ll tell you what does.

20 years of dedicated in-state recruiting.  Two decades of bypassing more “talented” prospects to, instead, provide opportunities to local players to play basketball at the collegiate level without having to leave their home behind.

The reason I know these are major sacrifices is because I am the only coach in NCBCA history to undertake such a monumental and sustained effort like this. So if you want loyalty, opt for the coach who demonstrates it year in and year out on the recruiting trail.

This practice has manifested positive impacts on the program in virtually every respect. For instance, we boast the most unmistakably Texan team atmosphere you’ll find anywhere. Every single one of your teammates will be Texan, who will share in your nuanced understanding of Texan culture.  As such, you’ll find this to be the most welcoming environment in college basketball. A home away from home.  For a West Texan like you, you’ll find common cause with Lance Cousins and Marquis Harrison.  All like pieces fitting snuggly together in a big Texas-shaped jigsaw puzzle.

Such team chemistry, naturally, wins games.  And the proof is in the pudding, as, in the past two seasons, we posted the first and second highest win totals in TCU history.  In fact, our seven-year streak of 30+ wins is the second longest in the nation.  In-conference, our dominance is unparalleled.  We’ve averaged only *1.6* conference losses in the last five seasons, so it’s no surprise that we will be defending the Big XVI crown in the upcoming season.

Speaking of which, we return 10/13 players from that 35-game-winning roster.  Our starting core is chock-full of veterans who have routinely proven their ability to win games.  Once I fill those remaining slots with talented prospects like you, we’ll be positioned to expand upon the successes of last season.

This small snapshot of recent success is only a fraction of the larger picture.  TCU has sustained this level of excellent play for decades.  Our NT streak nearly spans a quarter-century, and, within that timeframe, it would be a rare week to see TCU excluded from the top 25.  Featured in frequent heavyweight matchups and a routine place in the postseason, this program is a household name across the nation and one that is synonymous with elite basketball.

This renown is another thing that I attribute to my in-state recruiting efforts.  Before I forged the identity of this program, TCU was an NCBCA basement dweller.  But once I had a unique vision to offer, and the talented players of this state bought into that vision, the tide turned for TCU.  So, I will readily credit young Texans like you for the proud stature of this program.

In sequence with that rise in prestige, TCU also became one of NCBCA’s greatest sources of professional basketball talent.  In my career, I’ve sent nearly 50 players to the NBL, who altogether have earned nearly $3 billion.  This is one of the most impressive pro repertoires you’ll find.

You might be surprised that multiple walk-ons have contributed to those numbers.  Starting in 2059, I converted Blake Johnson—a *2-star* prospect—into an early entrant and first-round draft pick.  He spent a decade in the NBL.  More recently, you might recognize famed Trailblazer and All-Star Travis Fischman.  Despite being once the 177th-ranked recruit, Travis also left college as a first-rounder.  He saw success quickly in the pros signed a near-max deal in his fourth season.  Altogether, he’s salaried over $150M and serves as an aspirational figure for any NBL-seeking 3-star.

With my history of sending walk-ons to the NBL, it’s no surprise that walk-ons have also found significant playing time under my coaching as well.  Fischman is a great example, having started in his last two seasons with TCU.  Michael Kreefer, Omari Mcclanahan, Bryan Roberts, Mike Cham.  These are all walk-ons who earned starting roles in the past several seasons, proving that I don’t shy away from rewarding the players who work the hardest, regardless of their scholarship status. You will have just as much opportunity to reap the same playing time rewards.

Off the court, TCU is competitive institution academically, and you’d be well served by a degree here.  We excel in a wide range of fields of study, so you’re free to pursue anything you fancy.  Our Neeley School of Business and the Bob Schieffer College of Communication are particularly renowned—both top-50 in their fields.  So, if you’re looking for prep in negotiating your NBL contract or see yourself landing in sports broadcasting, TCU will have you covered.

the upcoming season. speaking of which, we return 10/13 players from that 35-game-winning roster.  our starting core is chock-full of veterans who have routinely proven their ability to win games.  once i fill those remaining slots with talented prospects like you, we’ll be positioned to expand upon the successes of last season. this small snapshot of recent success is only a fraction of the larger picture.  tcu has sustained this level of excellent play for decades.  our nt streak nearly spans a quarter-century, and, within that timeframe, it would be a rare week to see tcu excluded from the top 25.  featured in frequent heavyweight matchups and a routine place in the postseason, this program is a household name across the nation and one that is synonymous with elite basketball. this renown is another thing that i attribute to my in-state recruiting efforts.  before i forged the identity of this program, tcu was an ncbca basement dweller.  but once i had a unique vision to offer, and the talented players of this state bought into that vision, the tide turned for tcu.  so, i will readily credit young texans like you for the proud stature of this program. in sequence with that rise in prestige, tcu also became one of ncbca’s greatest sources of professional basketball talent.  in my career, i’ve sent nearly 50 players to the nbl, who altogether have earned nearly $3 billion.  this is one of the most impressive pro repertoires you’ll find. you might be surprised that multiple walk-ons have contributed to those numbers.  starting in 2059, i converted blake johnson—a *2-star* prospect—into an early entrant and first-round draft pick.  he spent a decade in the nbl.  more recently, you might recognize famed trailblazer and all-star travis fischman.  despite being once the 177th-ranked recruit, travis also left college as a first-rounder.  he saw success quickly in the pros signed a near-max deal in his fourth season.  altogether, he’s salaried over $150m and serves as an aspirational figure for any nbl-seeking 3-star. with my history of sending walk-ons to the nbl, it’s no surprise that walk-ons have also found significant playing time under my coaching as well.  fischman is a great example, having started in his last two seasons with tcu.  michael kreefer, omari mcclanahan, bryan roberts, mike cham.  these are all walk-ons who earned starting roles in the past several seasons, proving that i don’t shy away from rewarding the players who work the hardest, regardless of their scholarship status. you will have just as much opportunity to reap the same playing time rewards. off the court, tcu is competitive institution academically, and you’d be well served by a degree here.  we excel in a wide range of fields of study, so you’re free to pursue anything you fancy.  our neeley school of business and the bob schieffer college of communication are particularly renowned—both top-50 in their fields.  so, if you’re looking for prep in negotiating your nbl contract or see yourself landing in sports broadcasting, tcu will have you covered. coach strokesradio",867

The base rate for Spotify is .003 cents per stream but it all varies to what countries the streams come from, what's in the overall pot for that day and other factors. I suspect outside of the Spotify team itself there is only a small percentage of people who could accurately figure out how much an artist makes on a day to day basis. I remember one time I paid $80 to Omari MC to get on a playlist that should have at least made my money back. I was hoping for long term listeners. I got just 500 streams from India and made a nickel. They are supposed to be one of the premier promo companies but since then I have heard many consider them to be a scam and just a money taker. There out is always, ""Well, we can't guarantee anything."" No, but they could at least put their clients on a better list.

 The idea as far as I know for running ads is long term listeners but I generally over the now four years I or my band has been on Spotify just don't see it. You also have to really know the nuts and bolts about marketing and have a good sized budget in order for that to work. As far as playlists go, it seems like whenever you are rotated off a playlist your monthly listeners drop off. My band has had as many as 1,900 monthly listeners when we were on a bunch of playlists at the same time. Over time I had trouble finding more lists. We just went off the last one we were on and are at 54 monthly listeners. We consistently kept around 200 followers however. IMO chasing playlist and streams if you don't have the time or the budget is a loosing proposition. I think artists that are in that situation should look into selling directly off their website and or focusing on Bandcamp and the other similar sites. These have built in communities and if you can connect with those people, you'll probably be much better off in the long run. The band and I have always made more money from selling albums on Bandcamp. We leave our music on Spotify so people who don't know about Bandcamp can find it since it accounts for most of the listeners. We only post a couple of songs or at most half of the songs from an album on Spotify.

Scholarship

Mr. Fields,

That oppressive Gulf Coast humidity has been a weight on your back for far too long.  Pining for cool nights and cold winters, you sought refuge at Sam Houston State.  However, you found that the Huntsville air was near as balmy as it was in Devers.

Now that you’re taking the leap to the NCBCA, you’ve got a collection of programs in front of you spanning the nation, each offering its own cool solitude.  However, you needn’t look far for the relief you desire.  Just follow the Trinity River a few hours further inland and you’ll see the humidity percentages drop precipitously.

If one could devise an algorithm optimizing for both cooler climes and closeness to home, I have no doubt Fort Worth would tower above all other options.  Compared to your hometown, TCU provides cooler nights, lower temperatures, and an atmosphere that is less muggy, more breathable.  And, crucially, this solace is achieved within your beloved home state, still throwing distance from Mom and Dad and your friends in Devers and in Huntsville.

The Big XVI’s gargantuan conference footprint is another boon in this regard.  Away games will take you to WVU and BYU and the chilly peaks of the Appalachian and Wasatch Mountains.  You’ll spend cold December nights in wind ravaged Iowa when facing UNI or the aptly named Cyclones of Ames.  All while having planted your flag mere hours to the northwest.

The lack of overwhelming heat makes the TCU campus a pleasant refuge.  Beautiful green lawns dotted by American sycamores.  Students sunbathing and playing frisbee.  But the campus comes most alive when the weather starts to cool.  Fall brings football, and we cherish the season like any southern school should.  Participate in the ritual of tailgate barbecues, warmed by the fires of the grill or your TCU sweatshirt as the temperatures drop.

For Worth is also home to the Mecca of Texas basketball—not just for our top-to-bottom Texan roster, but also for the storied renown the TCU name radiates.  During your lifetime, few teams have maintained the level of consistent excellence we have.  You have never witnessed us miss the Big Dance and can count on one hand the number of seasons you’ve seen us win fewer than 25 games.  We are a behemoth on the recruiting trail and a staple of the top 25.  And no program in recent memory has been so dominant over their conference as TCU.

Last season was a testament to our prowess.  We clocked a final record of 30-9, our fifth straight season of surpassing the 30-win threshold.  Our non-conference slate was rife with ranked matchups and saw us notch victories over Gonzaga, Seton Hall, and Loyola, as well as further wins over tourney teams like Houston and Wake Forest.

Our steam only picked up once we entered conference play. From week 11 through week 28, we held an 18-game win streak, tearing through foe after conference foe.  Iowa State and a mere four-point loss were the only things separating TCU from our second consecutive regular season in-conference sweep.  In fact, the Cyclones handed us just our fifth regular season conference loss in the past four years, by far the nation’s lowest such mark in that span. As such, we have maintained at least a share of the conference crown since you were in middle school.

The 2075 season was clearly a continuation of all the excellent trends that have come to define this program.  I expect 2076 to be no different.  Despite losing our three most talented players from last season, we are still projected to be a tourney team come March.

The pollsters have rightly recognized the bevy of young talent on our roster. We’re led by two five-star recruits, and 4/5 of our scholarship players are underclassmen.  Furthermore, nearly every player on the roster has sat through a redshirt season, honing their skills before making their debut, and preserving a crucial year of eligibility.  This affords our team a level of maturity and experience that sets us above our peers.  These men are poised to make significant gains in the coming offseason and recapture all of last year’s successes.

With such a solid returning core, our three open scholarships are an opportunity to bolster our position.  This recruiting cycles, I’m directing my focus toward JUCO and graduate transfers for an immediate infusion of talent.  Your commitment alongside two other quality recruits would send TCU surging into the top 25 and return us to our rightful position as contenders on the national stage.

You would make a critical addition to the roster.  As I mentioned, we are a young team, and all the potential that brings can only be realized if it’s cultivated by steady mentorship.  The two years of experience you have under your belt would be invaluable for the team.  Particularly as a player who has had to fight to earn his keep and make the daring jump to the NCBCA, I’m eager to see you step into a leadership role at TCU.  

The exodus of Joe Robinson, Posh Muhammad, and Omari Mcclanahan has left the roster wide open for anyone to step up and be the star.  At TCU, you’ll make an immediate impact on the court as one of our go-to guys down low.  You have all the hallmarks of a traditional big—size, strength, rebounding—so I intend to use you accordingly.  When you’re on the floor, you will live in the paint, slamming ferocious dunks, gobbling up boards, and setting up an iron wall on defense.  Much like your role at Sam Houston.

You were a beast in the JUCO league and will be a competitor in the NCBCA.  While many coaches may see your status as a JUCO transfer as a deterrent, I see it as an asset.  The small crop of players that make the transition each season know what it is to persevere, to reap the fruits of their labor.

That’s why, relative to my peers in the highest echelons of coaching, I have a unique reputation for entrusting JUCO transfers with significant roles on my rosters.  A quick rewind through my history on the recruiting trail will reveal commitments from the likes of Stephen F. Austin, San Francisco, and former JUCO giants like Oklahoma, UTSA, and UTEP.  Many of these men were, not only starters, but some of the largest contributors on their respective rosters.  Players like Mik Mbayi, Jerel Gibson, Terrance Wilbekin, and Q.J. Najdawi.  Michael Fields can be the next name in that list of TCU’s JUCO stars.

More than just playing time, I reward these players with something far more elusive to a JUCO transfer: a path to the NBL.  The crop of players to make the jump to NCBCA each season is already exclusive enough; to elevate one level further to professional basketball is drastically more improbable.  That’s why your ears should perk up when I tell you that I’ve facilitated this coveted second leap several times over.

My first success story was modest, when Darryl Dorsey, an Omaha transfer, was picked up as an undrafted free agent by LAC in 2059.  His career was short lived but at least proved that the JUCO-&gt;NBL pipeline could pass through me.  My first JUCO-turned draftee was Terrance Wilbekin ten years later, another step along the path to my most recent success story in this vein, Jerel Gibson.  You him as a starter for the San Antonio Spurs, but I remember the day he arrived in Fort Worth from Stephen F. Austin.  At the time, he was a rising junior like you, but now, nearly a decade later, he is living proof that my tutelage can lead even a JUCO transfer to a long, prosperous career in the NBL.

If you broaden your scope to my entire NBL repertoire, it becomes even more impressive.  With just under 40 pros and $2.7 billion to my name, I am widely recognized as one of the most prolific pro producers in the nation.  My recent history producing lottery picks is more evidence of this fact.  In the last five drafts alone, I’ve sent four players to the lottery, all within the top ten.  2072 was particularly prolific, since I had two players—FCs like you—selected in the top five.  One was Brandon Rybak, the #1 pick, who notably followed Gary Weitzel, another Horned Frog #1 pick, by just *two years*.  Only three active coaches have multiple #1 picks in the Sawpom era, and you have the good fortune to share a state with one of them.

My respect I show JUCO transfers is an extension of the attitude I take toward all my players.  Mine is a legacy built on trust and dedication.  I’ve demonstrated this in my long tenure at TCU and the way I have dutifully signed extension after extension.  And, of course, I’ve marked myself as a coach of unparalleled dedication in my unceasing commitment to recruiting in-state talent.  But most of all, it’s the fact that my players always know they can depend on me that I hang my hat on.  My loyalty score is a perfect 100 and has remained unblemished for longer than you’ve been alive.

court as one of our go-to guys down low.  you have all the hallmarks of a traditional big—size, strength, rebounding—so i intend to use you accordingly.  when you’re on the floor, you will live in the paint, slamming ferocious dunks, gobbling up boards, and setting up an iron wall on defense.  much like your role at sam houston. you were a beast in the juco league and will be a competitor in the ncbca.  while many coaches may see your status as a juco transfer as a deterrent, i see it as an asset.  the small crop of players that make the transition each season know what it is to persevere, to reap the fruits of their labor. that’s why, relative to my peers in the highest echelons of coaching, i have a unique reputation for entrusting juco transfers with significant roles on my rosters.  a quick rewind through my history on the recruiting trail will reveal commitments from the likes of stephen f. austin, san francisco, and former juco giants like oklahoma, utsa, and utep.  many of these men were, not only starters, but some of the largest contributors on their respective rosters.  players like mik mbayi, jerel gibson, terrance wilbekin, and q.j. najdawi.  michael fields can be the next name in that list of tcu’s juco stars. more than just playing time, i reward these players with something far more elusive to a juco transfer a path to the nbl.  the crop of players to make the jump to ncbca each season is already exclusive enough; to elevate one level further to professional basketball is drastically more improbable.  that’s why your ears should perk up when i tell you that i’ve facilitated this coveted second leap several times over. my first success story was modest, when darryl dorsey, an omaha transfer, was picked up as an undrafted free agent by lac in 2059.  his career was short lived but at least proved that the juco->nbl pipeline could pass through me.  my first juco-turned draftee was terrance wilbekin ten years later, another step along the path to my most recent success story in this vein, jerel gibson.  you him as a starter for the san antonio spurs, but i remember the day he arrived in fort worth from stephen f. austin.  at the time, he was a rising junior like you, but now, nearly a decade later, he is living proof that my tutelage can lead even a juco transfer to a long, prosperous career in the nbl. if you broaden your scope to my entire nbl repertoire, it becomes even more impressive.  with just under 40 pros and $2.7 billion to my name, i am widely recognized as one of the most prolific pro producers in the nation.  my recent history producing lottery picks is more evidence of this fact.  in the last five drafts alone, i’ve sent four players to the lottery, all within the top ten.  2072 was particularly prolific, since i had two players—fcs like you—selected in the top five.  one was brandon rybak, the 1 pick, who notably followed gary weitzel, another horned frog 1 pick, by just *two years*.  only three active coaches have multiple 1 picks in the sawpom era, and you have the good fortune to share a state with one of them. my respect i show juco transfers is an extension of the attitude i take toward all my players.  mine is a legacy built on trust and dedication.  i’ve demonstrated this in my long tenure at tcu and the way i have dutifully signed extension after extension.  and, of course, i’ve marked myself as a coach of unparalleled dedication in my unceasing commitment to recruiting in-state talent.  but most of all, it’s the fact that my players always know they can depend on me that i hang my hat on.  my loyalty score is a perfect 100 and has remained unblemished for longer than you’ve been alive. coach strokesradio",1538

Mr. Rogers,

Only thirty miles to your north, is a college basketball paradise, which can fulfill all your desires.  At TCU, there’ll be no need for tearful goodbyes to family and friends.  They’ll be close enough for regular visits and can be on the sidelines of every home game—and many of the away games too, thanks to the Big XVI’s TX-saturated schedule—without so much as a day off work.

What’s more, you’ll find unrivaled comfort in the TCU locker room.  Our top-to-bottom Texan roster will make the transition to college seamless, and your shared state pride will turn any road venue or hotel room into a little pocket of home.

The architecture fanatic in you will be enthralled by the majestic gold brick structures that comprise TCU’s campus.  It’s a measured blend between Neoclassical and Art Deco, simultaneously evoking the prestige and sophistication of the former, and the sleek modernity of the latter.  Look at how the stark white columns of the Walsh Performing Arts building emulate the Pantheon.  Or the maximalist façade of Amon G. Carter Stadium, with its swooping curves, buttresses, and relief sculptures.

No exploration of TCU’s architecture is complete without mentioning the iconic gold “TCU buff” brick that coheres every building on campus into a singular artistic vision. When the Texas sun illuminates the pale gold brick and boldly contrasting red roofs, the resulting visual feast is unlike anything you’ll find at another university.

The sophistication of our architecture complements the prestige of our basketball program.  As one of NCBCA’s most enduring dynasties, our NT streak dates back two full decades, and we routinely procure top seeds come March.  We have a stranglehold over the Big XVI, having won at least a share of the regular season title for five consecutive seasons.  When also considering our successes in recruiting and the NBL draft, we are multi-faceted in our dominance.

Last season was emblematic of TCU basketball’s ascendancy.  We ranked top-ten in the preseason AP poll, and subsequently proved we deserved that recognition when we notched 34 wins, including a historic 22-0 clean sweep of the Big XVI.  While critical injuries robbed us of a CT title, we overcame the setback and rallied all the way to the Elite 8.

Despite losing half our scholarship players from that powerhouse roster, we still clocked in at #13 in the pre-recruiting polls.  An acknowledgement of returning stars like Joe Robinson and Omari Mcclahanan and our wealth of young talent coming off the bench.  With such a solid foundation, those four scholarships allow me to invest in players like you who will ensure TCU’s success for seasons to come.

Which brings me to your role on the TCU roster.  You’ll likely be redshirted your freshman year in order to maximize your contributions to the team.  As an athletic young center with surprising ball movement capabilities, you’ll become a critical piece of our lineup as upperclassmen in the frontcourt, like Mcclanahan, graduate.  I see you as a lockdown defender who can challenge shots and bully opponents in the paint, while, offensively, you’re more of a blue-collar guy, setting screens and finding open teammates on the wing.  Though, you certainly have the strength to slam it when called upon.

School Visit (3/5)

Mr. Harrison,

West. Texans. Love. TCU. What can I say?  Our current roster has two of ‘em: Omari Mcclanahan from El Paso and Jake Tobias from Spearman.  And you’re probably aware of Damier Martin, the Amarillo native we just sent in the first round.

It’s not too surprising though.  Fort Worth has long been Texas’s Mecca of college basketball.  The TCU locker room is where players from every corner of this state convene to represent their beloved state on the national stage.  As such, the team culture here is steeped in state pride. So, by taking that four-hour drive on I-20 (an afternoon stroll for West Texas), you too can join your fellow statesmen and feel the embrace of Texas brotherhood no other school can offer.

You’d also be joining one of the most elite clubs in the NCBCA.  TCU is the model of consistency with our 20-year-long NT streak—good for fourth in the nation.  We routinely clock in 30+ win seasons, dominant conference performances, and high seeds come tourney time.  Our stranglehold over the Big XVI is staggering, with a five-year streak of at least a share of the regular season title, including last season’s historic 22-0 sweep of in-conference opponents.  In addition wins, we’ve made our mark on the recruiting trail—regularly pulling in top-ten classes (and that’s *with* the all-TX handicap)—and in the NBL (more on that later).  We are truly a well-rounded program, elite in all respects.

It should be noted that TCU didn’t always have such renown.  When I took over this program, we were one of the very worst in the league.  The laughingstock of the (then) MWC, which itself was the laughingstock of the NCBCA.  Slowly, by making strides on the recruiting trail, then by cementing ourselves as regular NT participants, I built TCU into the juggernaut it is today.  Very few active coaches can claim they have built a program from the ground up like I have.

Of course, my long tenure has seen constant fluctuations from season to season.  I’ve had teams that have returned ten or eleven men, immediately prepared to improve upon the previous season’s successes.  I’ve also seen massive exoduses that required full reloads in the following offseson.  Unfortunately, this offseason is closer to the latter end of the spectrum.

We lost half our scholarship players from last season, including our star—Big XVI POTY and All-American Honorable Mention—Damier Martin.  With so many openings, the team’s immediate future hangs in the balance.  Will we be able to replenish and follow up our illustrious last season?  Or will recruiting misfires endanger the streak of excellence we have managed to maintain for so long?  Critical role players like you can sway the direction of the program going forward, and I know having that tangible impact is very important to you.

Another one of your priorities is the NBL.  I commend you for not allowing your recruit ranking discourage your dream of playing professional basketball.  With a coach like me, such discouragement would be unfounded.  Few coaches have been able to convert as many walk-ons into NBL talent as I have.

The league today possess two such examples: Bryan Roberts and Travis Fischman.  At 209th in the nation, Bryan was ranked lower than you out of high school.  But after five years at TCU—two as a starter—he was drafted by Miami in the ’69 Draft.  Even six years later, he’s managed to maintain a career, later signing a $10 million deal with Houston.

Three years before Roberts, Travis Fischman was another breakthrough walk-on, but his career trajectory has been even more impressive.  Once the 171st-ranked recruit, Travis was also a two-year starter for TCU.  However, he progressed so much in his time here, that he was an early entrant and first-round draftee in 2066.  He continued to improve at the professional level, earning an MIP and All-Star nod in his third season.  He then signed a near-max contract and has since amassed $155 million.

These two men are testaments to what walk-ons can achieve under my coaching.  The key to this success is my tendency to make more use of my walk-ons than my peers.  I have a very egalitarian mindset when it comes to privileging scholarship players versus walk-ons.  The best players play, and TCU’s roster last season was a good example.  We were a top-ten team that featured *two* starting walk-ons—Omari Mcclanahan and Michael Kreefer—both of whom return and will likely play even larger roles in the coming season.  So if you aim to see significant playtime in college, TCU is a good bet.

That non-discriminatory attitude shows how much I respect and value my players.  As such, I have built a community of trust and loyalty at TCU.  You will receive the same attention and devotion I show any of my players; I guarantee that.

Finally, TCU provides one of the finest educations in the state.  I’d particularly recommend our Neeley School of Business.  As a prospective pro athlete, gaining some financial acumen will be a major asset.
