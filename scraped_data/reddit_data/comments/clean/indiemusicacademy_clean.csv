Only this one guarantees streams. Playlist Push is a crapshoot.  Up to the curators.  But they have a lot of of the bigger curators under their umbrella

kaa1e5w,1700643330.0,musicmarketing,Krimshaw_42,"So my personal biggest takeaway is unfortunately not a great one.  I think when I started a few years ago I saw more hope than I do now for indie artists, but there's still some good news as well.  A lot of the bad news is related and it boils down to a few things. 

- All Social Media has become hostile to creators / artists.  They have suppressed their algorithms.  Organic reach is nearly impossible.  This is not by accident.  They want you to buy Ads.  They need you to buy Ads because they're publicly traded companies who need to generate more and more revenue.  That's just how the market works.  They start cool and artist friendly (TikTok) - then they get a critical mass of users and start going way too heavy on monetization, effectively ruining what made the platform cool.   So it's not your imagination.  The deck is increasingly stacked against you.  Right now there are no artist friendly platforms. None.  Zero.   Threads could change that if they get hashtags and DMs going.  Until then they are a non factor.

Spotify and YouTube.  You need to understand these are not profitable businesses.  So while yes, they are not paying artists hardly anything, they aren't turning a profit either.  Streaming is not a good business model.  You have to remember that for 10 years all content was effectively being stolen on Torrents and Limewire and before that Napster.  Piracy wiped out the traditional music industry completely.  Streaming is an attempt to bring it back but even big artists are not making bank and neither is Spotify.  The money is in having fans.  Fans that pay to see you live.  Buy merch (although the overhead on that is not great, until you're moving huge amounts of it).  So realistically the game is this, get fans and play live shows - or sell them stuff.  Physical Media, or Merch if you don't plan on playing live.  Or you could go the influencer / Podcaster route.

That being said - Spotify still has a HUGE market share of streaming activity AND presents a massive opportunity to reach fans anywhere in the world.  This is the good news.  It's a global market!  When you dig into the data on Chart Metric - most of the biggest streaming markets are in Latin America.  They LOVE music down there and the currency exchange rate is extremely favorable. 

So, if you have a small marketing budget, I would honestly put it towards Spanish language Ads in Central and South America and also Portuguese Ads in Brazil. 

Then, very important, I would familiarize yourself with Google Translate.  This is the part of the job I enjoy most.  The most important thing you can do to turn a casual listener into a fan is actually very simple. 

Talk to them.  Technology is now a great tool and without speaking a word of Spanish you can have a full conversation with someone in Guatemala.  Who will actually be grateful to hear from you.  And you'll learn about other countries and their culture. Their perspectives.  And your money will go infinitely further than trying to compete in the oversaturated and incredibly expensive to advertise in Primary Markets that everyone is always advertising in.  You can also learn how to run ads for $1 / day until you get better at it and then apply what you've learned to the major markets. 

Other than that, the biggest thing I would suggest is having a decent playlisting budget.  Spotify claims payola isn't allowed but that is an outright lie.  Every decent playlist wants money or a paid service to reach the curators and Spotify does not enforce their policies AT ALL.  There are some free resources to help with playlists, and sure, you can spend all day pitching, but you won't move the needle without money.  Why is playlisting important?  If done correctly it will train the algorithm to recommend your song to the right people.  And that is when Spotify starts working for you, not against you.  You must pitch the right songs to the right playlists though. Really know your genre, sub-genre, mood, activity, target audience.  (Gym / Workout playlists are popular for example.  Summer Playlists.   Chill Playlists.  Driving Playlists.)  You need to know the playlisting landscape. There's over FOUR BILLION playlists on Spotify!  And very few good ones!

Free Playlist Services:
Soundplate.Com
DailyPlaylists.Com

Good Subscription Services:

Artist.Tools (most valuable because they have a bot vetting service that is very helpful)
Playlist Supply
Playlist Hunter

SubmitHub is good for hitting up a few dozen curators and maybe some influencer placements if you're on a budget.  $100 worth of credits can get you meaningful results

Playlist Push is probably the best premium service - starts at $297 though - goes up to $5k campaigns

Indie Music Academy also starts at $297 - if you just wanna get in some big playlists, guaranteed streams and juice your numbers, they start at 10k guaranteed streams

Then after that there's a bunch of smaller players or ones I've not read good reviews on that I wouldn't use

My artists I've worked with have small and tight budgets, and are self financing their careers, so we're always looking to stretch every dollar far as we can so I just thought that might help some of you out and answer some questions.  I'm happy to answer any specific questions but that's kind of the main overview of what I've learned in a couple years in this crazy ""business""

Long live independent music!

Screw the corporate gatekeepers and the big money keeping all you talented mofos down!

jxr3zts,1693000526.0,musicmarketing,MysticCherryBlossom,"I haven't used playlistpush. 

I tried SubmitHub but only ever got rejected. I got tired of tracking down curators, listening to their playlists for like 30 minutes to make sure it was a good fit, writing a pitch to submit, and then still ultimately getting rejected so I decided I would just pay people to push my songs for me. No, I'm not talking about paying people to place me on a playlist (that's probably botted), but paying to have 3rd parties push my songs to legitimate curators.

So far, I have used YouGrow, Indie Music Academy, and Partnered Projects. There's dangers in using services like those too. In case you do decide to go this route:

YouGrow will 100% get you fast streams, but as someone mentioned, it was mostly Latin American streams, which probably fucked up my algorithm. You live and you learn right?

Indie Music Academy probably gave me the best results. I got on a great playlist, got some really good streams, got added to some other playlists from just being on that one, someone actually reached out to me on IG after finding me on this playlist, and I still get some streams on that song from people who found me on this playlist (not a lot but still more than any of my other songs). Couple of things about them though, they were only able to find placement for 1 of the 3 songs I submitted to them(refunds are guaranteed if they can't place you). And, it takes them fucking FOREVER to place you. Like, it took me weeks before they placed my 1 song, and then like a month or two before they told me they couldn't place me for the other 2. That's a LONG time. I didn't realize how long and thought this was normal until I tried Partnered Projects.

After Indie Music Academy kept being unable to place me, I tried Partnered Projects. They have somewhat of a co-sign from Andrew Southworth, so I figured they were probably legit. It only took them a few days to place me, and they were probably the best at actually placing me on RELEVANT playlists. The promotion I started with them is currently still running, so I am not sure how good the long term effects will be but I am happy enough with the results I want to use them again. In fact, probably going to use them for the song I just released AND the one after that. They also don't guarantee you placement, so they don't charge you until they have secured you a placement.

Anyway, paying for playlisting in anyway isn't a great idea (saying this as someone who does it) since as I mentioned it can fuck up your Spotify algo if you end up on the wrong playlists and also the long term benefits are questionable. While I got on some personal and smaller playlists from being on these paid playlists, I didn't gain any followers from it. So, lots of short term listeners, a few long term listeners of those particular songs, but no actual fans.

Only reason I still use this method is because this is the only method where I have seen SOME positive gains. I am currently promoting my new song harder than I have promoted ANY song ever (haven't paid to have it pitched for playlisting yet) by using ads on IG while also posting regularly on TikTok and YouTube. So far, the results have been abysmal (it's only been a week so far), so yeah...I can only do what I can until I start performing live, which will hopefully be the push I need to actually start gaining a following.

There are a ton of places you should upload/register your song no matter *where* you release it. A shortlist would be:

* [BMI](https://youtu.be/Bvum75E14Jk) or [ASCAP](https://youtu.be/Bvum75E14Jk)
* SoundExchange
* SongTrust (or CD Baby Pro)
* US Copyright Office

You can even upload to more places like [Allmusic.com](https://Allmusic.com) to get your song properly credited in music databases.

I also agree with the others that using a distributor like Distrokid or CD Baby would be a good move.

Here is a YouTube video explaining everything I mentioned above in regards to where you need to register your song:
