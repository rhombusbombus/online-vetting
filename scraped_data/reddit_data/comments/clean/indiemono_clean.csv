Try to submit to spotify's editorial staff at least a month a head of time, and then use playlist submission websites like Indiemono, Submithub, and Playlist Push. If you don't care about blowing up, don't worry about social media. Just focus on getting plays, and this is your best way to do it. Like everything else, it will only work if your music is good, though.

An understated part of the process is also making sure your bio and album art cover are all top tier. People judge the music along with the image and your status as a musician. If you don't already have crazy amounts of volume plays wise, you're already at a disadvantage. So you really need to knock the music and visual out of the park.",2,,/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/j1hguz/how_do_a_properly_release_an_ep/g703wft/,"Utilize a good distribution company.

1) mostly add 20-80 tracks per playlist.
2) Make sure you have similar group of BPM (like 60-100, 80- 120). in short, don't add one track which is very fast and other very slow in speed. It will boost your algorithm
3) Be on submithub, indiemono, etc. They are services where most musical artists cones to promote there new songs. Your playlist can skyrocket if someone get viral from your playlist. Also, you can do pay for playlist campaign if you got organic reach.
4) Don't add single artist over and over. It not only kills Spotify algorithm but also make Spotify think that you are bot.

2. College radios - it works!! check [this podcast](https://songtalk.ca/shows/college-radio-how-do-i-get-my-music-played/) about submitting to them.

Second, I'd scout the web for more independent playlist curators - some of these playlists have a serious following and there are a lot playlisters out there that are not on SubmitHub.

* [MySphera](https://www.mysphera.co/our-curators/) / [Musicto](https://www.musicto.com/) / [indiemono](https://indiemono.com/) \- sites with free submissions options.

dqqsbtd,1512383778.0,edmproduction,blazin2323,"If you are releasing your tracks independently (i.e. through a distributor like Distrokid/CDBaby etc), then there are a number of ways to submit to playlists *on* Spotify:

* SubmitHub has some blogs that run small/medium sized Spotify playlists
* Indiemono and Soundplate both offer ways to submit to some small/medium playlists
* Pay for a marketing firm to pitch your track to independent playlist curators (this is by far the most expensive method, but will give you the most ROI - providing your track is actually worth pitching)

There is a way to submit tracks to the Official Spotify Electronic playlists - via a Google form, can't find the link right now but will have a hunt through my emails. You do have to submit your track a good 3-4 weeks before release though, as I expect they get a TON of submissions.

If you are releasing through a label, then I would imagine they should cover all of the marketing.
