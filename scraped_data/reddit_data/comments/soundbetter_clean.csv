kqyiz8o,1708238600.0,Deuce9lives,theJoshFrost,"from my experience working with artists (not just Deuce, and for the record i got a feature from Deuce that i was moderately happy with), but doing a feature with someone and then telling them what to do on the feature doesn't usually go well. i find that its always better to just let them do their own thing on the song. if you start telling artists what to do, they're going to feel some type of way about it and the collaboration is going to be worse because of it. 

it'd be one thing if you were a biggol producer or curator and telling artists how to do their parts, but i'd imagine most people you will be approaching for features have more listeners/experience than you, and therefor do not think you know better than they do.

if you REALLY need a feature to do exactly what you want, i'd recommend going on soundbetter (or even fiverr) and getting someone from there to do it, because they actually will do whatever you want.",1,1.0,/r/Deuce9lives/comments/1ati0ih/deuce_scammed_me/kqyiz8o/,"from my experience working with artists (not just Deuce, and for the record i got a feature from Deuce that i was moderately happy with), but doing a feature with someone and then telling them what to do on the feature doesn't usually go well. i find that its always better to just let them do their own thing on the song. if you start telling artists what to do, they're going to feel some type of way about it and the collaboration is going to be worse because of it.  it'd be one thing if you were a biggol producer or curator and telling artists how to do their parts, but i'd imagine most people you will be approaching for features have more listeners/experience than you, and therefor do not think you know better than they do. if you REALLY need a feature to do exactly what you want, i'd recommend going on soundbetter (or even fiverr) and getting someone from there to do it, because they actually will do whatever you want.","from my experience working with artists (not just deuce, and for the record i got a feature from deuce that i was moderately happy with), but doing a feature with someone and then telling them what to do on the feature doesn't usually go well. i find that its always better to just let them do their own thing on the song. if you start telling artists what to do, they're going to feel some type of way about it and the collaboration is going to be worse because of it.  it'd be one thing if you were a biggol producer or curator and telling artists how to do their parts, but i'd imagine most people you will be approaching for features have more listeners/experience than you, and therefor do not think you know better than they do. if you really need a feature to do exactly what you want, i'd recommend going on soundbetter (or even fiverr) and getting someone from there to do it, because they actually will do whatever you want.",174

kphiocl,1707401953.0,musicproduction,AjiGuauGuau,"Is that price for the premium gig or standard? 

I ask this because sometimes people put limits on the standard and basic gig in order to encourage you to go for the top tier. 

I think that when talking to the person you'll know if their vibe is to strictly stick to the wording of the agreement or if they just specified that to protect themselves from time wasters. It avoids, for example, being asked to do endless revisions by some amateur who then refuses the final work and they end up not even getting paid at the end. 

So, you might find that the person isn't unreasonable and will honour whatever revision the work needs, two is often more than plenty anyway if you know what you're doing. 

On the other hand, I find the strict limits that fiverr encourages artists to specify in their gigs i.e. two minutes, to be annoying and off-putting. Usually though you find that this limit is much higher with the premium gig. 

So, unless you're looking at a v specific job, like, I need someone to just sing a couple of verses, and if you're looking for someone for the whole song (with maybe double tracking, or background harmonies as well) you need to look at their premium gig to see if they are really in your price range.

In any case, talk to them, they might be flexible about their prices and make you a custom gig price. 

You put the cash up at the beginning, but they don't receive anything until you release the funds via fiverr once you're happy with the results. 

One last thing. If you're on a budget, it can be daunting parting with $200 without knowing if you're going to get what you need from someone who is far away and with whom you are dealing remotely. Perhaps you can offer to pay their lowest priced gig in exchange for a quick test run, which can be upgraded to, say, the premium gig if you like what you hear. This way you're both confident about working with each other and the singer still gets paid something for their time if it doesn't work out. Some sellers even  offer free demos, although I imagine most don't advertise it because you could end up being taken for a ride by a bunch of time wasters. 

I think there are some amazing singers on fiverr, although it's also true that many find it too much of a hassle and end up leaving. There's also a lot of quite terrible amateurs.

kp102rv,1707142932.0,audioengineering,HillbillyEulogy,"This business is the same now as it was when I started out in the mid-90's. It's a referral-based business. Sure, get your profile out there - there's no harm in that. And getting a good social media ground game out there to build brand recognition is a great idea - even if you are paying a bit to appear in peoples' feeds. 

Marketers refer to this as '[the purchase funnel](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/The_Purchase_Funnel.jpg/1200px-The_Purchase_Funnel.jpg)'. Your prospects need to be made aware you exist to generate interest, which ultimately drives consideration, desire, and trial. 

What it leaves out is the ""CRM"" or ""Consumer Relationship Management"". Even being blunt with your early adopters and saying, ""listen, imma cut you a break on my rates while I build my client base"" puts them on your team. You want what (again, marketing gibberish) is now called brand loyalty and evangelism. Not just repeat visits from your existing clients, but for them to be singing from the hilltops to anyone following them IRL *and* social media that their guy is amazing. 

Later chapters deal with the idea of cultivating exclusivity. Look at the drooling masses camped out like good consumers to get an iPhone 15 the day it comes out - even though we know there are pallets being shipped and you can just walk into the store and buy one in fifteen minutes if you can wait a week. The idea that ""oh, I hope I can get this guy to work on my project"" creates a huge demand. 

BUT - you need those initial clients. And you need to provide them with a superior service (price/performance/personability) in a *very very very* crowded market. I'm just some guy with a few significant credits under his belt and more experience and better tools than a lot of competition - but I also work entirely by referral. I don't have a SoundBetter page - I just send people a link to my Discogs. The fact I'm not actively promoting at this point arguably *helps.*",1,1.0,/r/audioengineering/comments/1ajh8jg/remote_work_as_a_music_producer_and/kp102rv/,"This business is the same now as it was when I started out in the mid-90's.

kk4uxa9,1706550809.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,OpalArmor,"At this level, you’re probably not renting a studio and also hiring an engineer and also a mixing engineer and also a mastering engineer. At the professional level you’d hire the best of each you can afford, but for getting a competent recording done on a budget you are likely going to a small studio owned by the engineer who’s time is included n the price. They may be available to mix and master it for you or at least be able to refer you to someone. I would budget at least $500usd a song and that’s assuming you can nail each part in two or three takes. 

What does a studio like this get you? First and most importantly someone who (presumably) knows what they’re doing. “The second line was a little pitchy, let’s try that again” type feedback. They should be able to hear what’s off and what needs to be done to fix it. They will know what microphones to use and where to put them to get the sound you want.  Second, they’ll have better gear. Microphones for one, but also preamps, compressors, etc etc. Third, a good sounding room, which depending on what you’re doing could make or break the record. 

Now do you need any this to get to a level you’re happy with? I don’t know. It depends on whether or not you have the time and aptitude to figure out the whole process. Going DIY you can spend as much time as you like to really nail a take you’re happy with. You may not have good mics, but great albums have been cut with just SM57s. Your bedroom might sound good enough to get a clean recording with minimal treatment. It all sorta depends on your situation. 

Mixing is a different ball game. And honestly if youre going to spend money this is where you should do it. 

For my money I’d track it at home, get simple, clean recordings of everything and send it off to someone to mix it. Soundbetter is fine for finding someone to do this. At this level expect $100-300 per song depending on their resume. Be clear with what sound you’re hoping to achieve. The mixer may be willing to master it too at their hourly rate, but expect to find someone else to do it. Expect 50-100 a song. There are free AI mastering services available through like distrokid and the like, but unless you have no money I’d advise against it.

There's nothing counterproductive about it - in fact, it's quite the opposite.","i'm not actually looking for services / quotes - the reason why i ask is that many artists make music as a hobby. it's not a career or a money maker - it's something that they do for fun / out of passion for music.  so, paying out 50 quid for someone else to run their song through a shitty ai mastering plug-in on soundbetter isn't really option and shelling out multiples of that for professional / semi-professional services is largely a waste of money.  that's why so many artists strive to get better at mixing - so they can produce their own mixes, as well as learning a craft.  in many ways - for many artists - being able to mix their own stuff *is* an intergral part of making music. there's nothing counterproductive about it - in fact, it's quite the opposite.",144

For every project, we have a zoom call and we talk about in detail what the vision for the song is. For example, one of my future releases had a real Juice Wrld/The Kid Laroi Vibe on the demo beat. So when we met, I told him, ""I'm feeling a Juice Wrld vibe for this one. I want some strong 808s, a nice guitar rhythm/lead. The first half of the chorus is soft so I want a smooth piano there and I like vocal samples playing in the background for ear candy."" I don't have anything time stamped, I just talk about the vision and let him choose the samples, and the rest of the orchestration of the song. Sometimes I have no reference and just say do what you think is best. We always talk about the structure of the song and move things around as needed. He has A LOT of experience, has almost 1k reviews on SoundBetter so I always trust his instinct. I always tell him what I want, then he tells me what he thinks, and we find some middle ground because ultimately I want the track to be the best version of the track that it can be and want it to be attractive to multiple genre listeners (so as commercial as possible in that regard). So to answer your question, it just depends on the producer. Work with the guy, tell him your vision, then let him know the rest is left up to you and to be creative. If he doesn't do what you want, now you know, find a better producer for your next release.

[There are many reasons why artists and producers mixes don't sound good](https://www.timelesssoundbk.com/why_your_mixes_probably_dont_sound_good/) \- You need to ask yourself if you want to be an artist or if you want to be a mix engineer. Sounds like you want to be an artist.

To find engineers, you're going to hear a lot of SoundBetter, EngineEars, messaging artists you like on IG and asking them who the engineer was, etc. I think the real magic is in how you as an artist can vet the engineer yourself.

\- Ask them for ""before"" and ""after"" examples of songs they have mixed privately and see if they will send, that way you can hear what they are capable of. As an engineer myself, I feel it's difficult to know exactly how another engineer impacted a song if I can't hear the raw multitracks or raw demo - After all, mixing is a game of improving the initial production and recording. We often can not publish many rough demos of tracks we have worked on publicly, because that would require the artist to have their rough demo floating around on the internet and many are sensitive to that (no all though). 

\- Ask them to walk you through their process. You'll get a handle on if they're good at the ""client work"" stuff like setting expectations, replying in a timely fashion, asking you about your project, etc.

Hope this helps - Again, I'd love to hear how it panned out for you.",1,1.0,/r/ableton/comments/16bcpa5/audio_engineer_recommendations_for_mixingmastering/khaaoyu/,"I'd love to hear how your situation played out.

kh9zqv0,1704926408.0,audioengineering,wazzup_izurboi,"You have probably already moved on from this - In case you haven't, 

It's tough for a few reasons to find ""great"" at ""the right price"".

1) Once engineers and studios publish their rates, they can get locked-in to them. This is why a lot of recording studios and engineers don't publish their rates on their websites, so they can reserve the right to charge more or less where applicable when it comes to big projects.

2) IMO (as an engineer) it's difficult to determine to quantify how well an engineer can mix a song. As a consumer, you never get to hear what they started with. A lot of tutorials of the great engineers you see online are working with something that was immaculately recorded, and has been prepped for them by an assistant. They have probably worked on songs that sounded much worse in the outset, and they were able to polish that turd into a decent sounding song, but you'd never know it because you didn't hear the initial multitracks. I try to compensate for this by getting explicit permission from artists to post ""before"" and ""after""s of their songs [https://www.timelesssoundbk.com/projects/](https://www.timelesssoundbk.com/projects/)

3) Every song is different - Even the best engineers don't win in some shootouts because everyone has their own approach to mixing. 

To get past all of this I'd suggest the following to you:

\- Look for engineers on SoundBetter, but contact them off-platform. Ask them for ""before"" and ""afters"" of songs so you can hear what they were actually able to do to bring out the best qualities in the music and artists.

\- DM artists you like on IG. Just tell them, ""hey I love your music and the songs sound amazing -"" (butter them up a bit) ""- Who do you use for an engineer? I'd love to get in touch with them"" keep it short and direct.

\- Check locally on Google Maps, Yelp, etc. for Studios and Mix Engineers. They may not be the most well known (esp. if you don't live in a city) but these types are everywhere now. Working with someone local might mean working with someone you can trust will work with you to get it right.

As for enforcement you can either select a distributor that offers income splitting from the source \[ideal\] or send the producer a statement/accounting every single year for the rest of your life. \[some of them require quarterly\]

Guys, seriously. If you respect your music, and want others to respect your work, **do NOT find professional creative collaborators on Fiverr or upwork or soundbetter. It's your music, it's not a freaking UBER.**

&gt; his best package was only $200 but he said he won Grammy awards for being on Pharrell‘s album titled GIRL

$200 is NOTHING to an engineer with real experience and credits of that caliber, even if they only assisted on those records. Think more starting at $500-600 and that's still cheap. So this should have been your first red flag.

&gt; Anyway, I’m very disappointed but I’m just wondering why would someone with this level of professionalism do this?

1. Overall I’m ‘only’ been mastering full time for 6 years. I went from 50 projects my first year to 350 projects this year (190 last year so a very big jump in the last year). Till now I invested back in the business/studio to the point I don’t need to invest anymore (got to my dream desk status and the best one can get). 
I say full time basically from the point I’ve decided to quit my day job and just do that. I would say about a year until I made an ‘average yearly salary’.

2. My website to be honest is more of a business card, I barely get contacts through there. 
My strongest POC’s is social media, and more specifically Instagram. 
I’m on Soundbetter from the beginning as well and it did help lunch my career with lots of strong contacts, but now days it’s barely moving and I’ll just get the random contact here and there. My rate is to high for these platforms.

3. I always wanted to be in the music world, started as a DJ, music producer, mixing engineer and found myself mastering. I related to mastering the most also because music production didn’t work out for me, which is what I wanted to do the most. 
How did it worked out? I hustle hard, I’m creative in my marketing, I’m strong on customer service and approaching people, I work when people are lazy or down, I’m 24/7 on top of this, keeping ambition high and just pushing towards my goals always. There’s no way around it. It’s difficult, it’s depressing, you need to do a lot of things you’re not meant to do/want to do, but actually mastering is 30% of an engineer day, you need to also be great In marketing, social skills and overall creative.

kcqfgo2,1702186143.0,Filmmakers,vivid_blue_sea07,"Fellow filmmaker, props to you for wanting to diversify your skill set! It really does speak to the multidimensional nature of our craft. First off, yes, Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) such as Garageband or Logic Pro X are pros if you're Team Apple. For Windows, consider FL Studio or Cubase.

These DAWs are jam-packed with tons of in-built instruments and musical loops, which completely bypasses all the rigamarole of sound recording or dealing with mics. Don't underestimate the sheer amount of tutorials on platforms like YouTube - it's pretty much Film Scoring 101.

One point to note though - film scoring is a whole other beast. Tones, mood shifts, aligning to on-screen action - it can be a meticulous endeavor, particularly if you're already juggling a myriad of tasks on your plate. What do you think about leveraging royalty-free music sites, or even bringing onboard a budget freelancer? Platforms like Epidemic Sound, Bensound, AudioJungle could be time-savers, categorized by theme, mood, genre.

If you do consider outsourcing this, Fiverr, Upwork or Soundbetter have some budget-friendly options. It's about directing the music more than producing it, freeing up more of your time for core filmmaking duties. 

What are your thoughts, folks? Any film scoring experiences to share or anyone with deep knowledge of DAWs who could provide a 'pro tips' rundown for our friend here who's new to music creation?",1,1.0,/r/Filmmakers/comments/18ej0ld/how_do_i_learn_how_to_compose_music_for_my_short/kcqfgo2/,"Fellow filmmaker, props to you for wanting to diversify your skill set!

2) Suena como si el man ya hubiera dañado/perdido/vendido/robado el resto de los equipos. Pelearle al man no va a lograr mucho si ya lo hicieron.

""It's great that you're exploring ways to turn your passion for music into a potential source of income. Both creating sample packs and ghost producing are viable options, and here's some advice on how to get started with each:  
\### Creating Sample Packs:  
1. \*\*Quality is Key:\*\*  
   \- Ensure that your samples are of high quality and unique. Stand out from the crowd by offering something distinctive.  
2. \*\*Research Platforms:\*\*  
   \- Platforms like Splice, Loopmasters, and Gumroad allow producers to sell sample packs. Research these platforms to understand their submission processes.  
3. \*\*Market Yourself:\*\*  
   \- Create a personal brand for your sample packs. This could include a website, social media presence, or a distinct artistic style. Building a brand can make your packs more appealing.  
4. \*\*Engage with the Community:\*\*  
   \- Join online music production communities and forums. Share your knowledge, participate in discussions, and subtly promote your sample packs when relevant.  
5. \*\*Pricing Strategy:\*\*  
   \- Research the pricing of similar sample packs. Consider offering a free sample or a demo to attract potential customers.  
\### Ghost Producing:  
1. \*\*Build a Portfolio:\*\*  
   \- Create a portfolio showcasing your best work. This can include a variety of genres to demonstrate your versatility.  
2. \*\*Online Platforms:\*\*  
   \- Join freelancing websites like Upwork, SoundBetter, or Fiverr. Create a profile highlighting your skills and experiences.  
3. \*\*Network:\*\*  
   \- Connect with artists, producers, and managers on social media platforms. Joining music production groups and forums can provide opportunities to showcase your skills.  
4. \*\*Collaborate:\*\*  
   \- Offer to collaborate with emerging artists. This can be a way to build relationships and gain exposure.  
5. \*\*Professionalism:\*\*  
   \- Approach ghost producing with professionalism. Clearly communicate your terms, pricing, and expectations. Establish a contract to protect both parties.  
6. \*\*Feedback and Revisions:\*\*  
   \- Be open to feedback and willing to make revisions. Satisfied clients are more likely to recommend you to others.  
Remember, success in these areas often requires patience, consistency, and a commitment to continually improving your craft.

If you go to [soundbetter.com](https://soundbetter.com) and there are tons of grammy winning pros over there.

Look up your favorite artist and thee are bound to be a few guys and girls who worked with them. 

Reach out and tell them what you want.

I requested a one hour 1 on1. 

We looked at some of my songs I had been working on and he showed me some of the songs he was working on.

What struck me was not just the detail to the tracking but the forethought to the tone selection that was all made pre production.

For example, when I used to work I'd say ""that drum sound is cool bet it work well with this bass. Then I'd add in my awesome guitar tone, throw in some vocals"" 

inevitably I'd end up looking to EQ something to stand out or sit back.

When he chose his tones it wasn't ""the best"" tone it was the best tone that would sit best in that part of that song. 

He knew the role of the instrument and what color to make it before it even got tracked.

Changes everything

Combine that with ***thoughtful arrangements*** and your mixes just create themselves. 

Not saying I've mastered it by any means and it 100% adds a ton of time to my workflow  but the results are much better than my previous work.

Anyway....

Go to soundbetter there are tons of pros there with label experience and you can hire them for a million different things (vocal production, producing, evaluation, mixing, mastering).",1,1.0,/r/musicproduction/comments/1815t4l/best_cheap_gear_under_100_that_has_improved_and/kaan1hl/,I read your comment  quickly as Which Primate.

There is nothing wrong with buying or wanting shortcuts by looking for music gear and software, but it is an endless pit that we all fall into at one point or another. There is no software that will make you great at music production. I would recommend choosing something and sticking with it for a couple of months. Hopefully, this list of recommended beginner/prosumer items for starting your home studio may be helpful to OP as well.  
  
Hardware:  
\- Computer (this could be an entire post on it's own)  
\- Audio Interface (Recommend Universal Audio Apollo Twin or Focusrite Clarett+ 2Pre)  
\- Midi Keyboard/Pads (Recommend MPK series or Native Instruments Kontrol S-Series)  
\- Speakers (Recommend Yamaha HS8  or HS7)  
\- Headphones (Recommend AKG K240)  
\- Microphone (Recommend Neumann TLM 103 or Rode NT1)  
  
Software:  
\- DAW (Studio One)  
\- VST (Native Instruments Complete Standard or Ultimate)

k2jwutu,1695891728.0,audioengineering,howboutdatden,"What I find, on fiverr, is that a ton of five star reviews just means that the person concerned has a good price to job ratio with something that pleases people who mostly have no idea what a good job would look like. Which is fine for them. However, if you're looking for someone who can do a great job you have to employ other criteria on fiverr and with mixing engineers it is kind of tricky. When hiring session musicians, you can tell a lot from the examples they provide. This is not so straightforward with engineers and to add the problem, in my experience, although most people on fiverr will ask that you get in touch first before booking to make sure you're on the same page, in actual fact they will *never* say no, even if they aren't suitable for the job. At least, like you point out, fiverr does make it easy to cancel a job done badly (although this aspect must suck for sellers who encounter difficult customers). 

So what I'm saying is, I'm sure there are very good engineers on fiverr, but you really have to do your homework and not rely on the mostly useless feedback. And yeah, you will likely find someone really good for 150-300. Personally, I haven't tried it for engineers, but I've worked with a lot of session musicians. Some of them are incredible and what I find happens is that as we continue to work together, we build a realtionship and move on from the slightly icky vibe that fiverr emanates. I can't afford to throw money around taking wild chances but once I know a certain person will deliver, then I can pay more because it is a form of guarantee. I see it as a way of getting to know new contacts who aren't local to me but might become future partners, so to speak.

k2bhafy,1695752841.0,audioengineering,The66Ripper,"You get what you pay for. There's a reason why most engineers who are actually worth their salt start at a low of $250/song. For a while when I was still mixing full-time I was around $500, but I've got major label credits with household name artists, so it's justifiable for most people. 

Another angle that's often left out of the discussion is turnaround time. A lot of the fiverr folks are swamped with mixes (which you need to be if you're charging $25/mix), so the amount of time they can spend on a mix is way less than someone who's charging upwards of $250. 

IMO all of the online platforms are really just ways for engineers who have established a history of clientele on that platform to rake in extra money by dropping some stuff into a template and changing a few settings around. At the end of the day, whether you like the mix or not, the work is done and they're paid for it. 

Engineears is a little bit different IMO (not on the platform, nor do I want to be) but it definitely seems like the vetting process from the team there leans towards some more qualified folks, and the pricing honestly isn't too bad when compared to a soundbetter or the more expensive folks on fiverr.

Overall, it is a great platform and I have had very good experiences. 

Main suggestion is to always listen to a good amount of their work and listen for people where you like where their ear goes. There are lots of highly skilled people on there, but finding someone where you really like their sound and how it can work with your music will make it better. I always like to give them some flexibility to interpret and tweak because they know their instruments and have well trained ears.

My only bad experience was a vocalist who took it upon himself to completely rewrite half the lyrics to the song Ghost in my Reflection. I was open to rewrites but had very specifically requested he run anything other than a minor tweak past me. I restated that on a few occasions.

And while I am not the best lyricist, his changes were honestly terrible lol.

k11xvc7,1694992473.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,CanIGetAnEncore-,"Hi there!

I've been in the exact same spot as you are. I'm lucky enough to work in music. I'm also autistic so I know the specific struggles that come with it.

I went through a huge stint of a ""normal"" job before landing a role within music so I also know the struggles of that. I used to hate festivals because I'd be jealous of the artists playing. I never really became an artist but I do work with a lot of them, and do a full-time, heavily production-focused role.

I saw this post and want to give a few personal things that helped me - it may not help, but wanted to share nonetheless in case it does:

1 - Few book recommendations - Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*** + Unf*ck Yourself + The War of Art really got me out of specific ruts. Read or audiobook, I personally prefer the latter. Mark Manson, Gary John Bishop, and Steven Pressfield (I think?) are the authors. Slightly unconventional self-help books, but it may help give you a healthier relationship between your life and music.
2 - If you want an artist/band career, it is so common for people to either have a job or live with family. It takes a lot to fully sustain an artist career and live off of it, and takes a full team. Most people do both. And that's totally okay.
3 - Relationships are everything. Yeah it sucks, but you do have to put yourself out there. I know autism comes into play, so don't shy away from being open about your struggles if you need to (How to win friends &amp; influence people is another great book - I had to learn how to be social and interact with people, as I'm sure you have had to as well). Send demos, post music content, go to events/conferences/networking opportunities/etc. Go with friends or by yourself. Or be active on forums. Eventually if you want an artist career, you'd need a full team (mgmt, legal, pr, marketing, touring, etc) - can't all be done alone.
4 - There are so many other roles within music other than being in a band. See places like SoundBetter to see what some creative professionals do, but there's also roles within companies, labels, publishers, venues, management, studios, etc. 
5 - Age honestly doesn't matter, don't let anyone say otherwise. So many artists are breaking out in their 30's, it's never too late. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to do it by a set age or timeframe.
6 - Rejections sucks but it will happen 99.9% of the time. You build thicker skin, and the only way to do so is exposure. Only really takes the 0.1% to kickstart something.

These were all just off the top of my head. Idk if this will help or be counterintuitive, but I know how much it hurts to be in your shoes so I just wanted to take the time to share a few things that helped me that I've learned over the years, and maybe something here will help you; either by helping get yourself back out there or by building back a healthier relationship with your passion.

Didn't proof read this so hope it all makes sense.

I'm sure there'll be other people replying to this post who can also do it too. Sites like SoundBetter and Fiverr are also a good place to look, although be wary of people offering super low prices and super fast turnarounds - these people will just slap a preset on your vocals and not give them the time they deserve.

The level of production needed depends on how ready your vocals are - have you comped them yourself, or do you need an objective third party to listen to multiple takes and comp the best ones together? How tuned and tight do you want them - super ""radio ready"" perfect, or just catch the odd flat note and nudge a couple phrases in time with others? Do you need the vocals mixing too or just produced, ready for another engineer to mix?

Try make things as easy for your vocal producer as you can - proper prep work sometimes means a cheaper price, and often a better result. It's always worth taking the time to properly prepare your vocal recordings - this means export each multitrack as a 24-bit WAV file at the sample rate it was recorded at, making sure all start at the same point, and LABEL THEM RIGHT!

No. The drawbacks of platforms like Fiverr (ie: upwork, soundbetter, etc) is that tons of people are on them and in order to get good reviews it pushes you to lower your rates to scraps for the privilege of getting the chance of having some very good reviews which will gradually let you raise your price. All while the platform taking a cut. Also all communications happen through the platform, so you don't really get to develop direct relationships with your clients most of the time.

Nice intro riff. I like the cut off effect.

Vocals are pitchy.

Unique arrangement though it seems unintentional. I think some delicate elements would sell it better. 

A VERY soft pad, some soft celeste bells reinforcing the guitar arpegios, maybe some percussion... nothing crazy, shakers or a hi hat part. Something top end to give it some movement. Very soft, buried... more of a feeling.

With just the bare parts it sounds like you didn't know what to do not that you went for sparse. 

Vocal performance is your biggest issue. Need to get some better takes and maybe send it to someone on fiverr or Soundbetter and have it professionally tuned. If you don't want to do that try double or tripling it. Sometimes layering it hides pitchy performance. Def. hit those harmonies with layers and thicken them up.... pan them.

Get yourself a few inspiration songs and dissect them. What are they doing in the space. Is there reverb? Synths? I doubt it's hard silence...

Last time, I was warned that there was a snare that was a bit too loud and if he tamed it in the master it would affect other things as well. So he checked my homework and I fixed that snare up before sending it back.

I can't imagine this isn't a total rip-off. They've got to be making money somehow and I'd wager it's grafted from each transaction coordinated through that site. Or maybe the pros are paying the advertise there and it stands to reason that they'd pass the cost onto you. And if the artist is paying then they're a straight up chump. 

Find an album you like. Check out the names of the people who worked on it. Google them. They almost certainly have a website with an email address or a phone number. Tell them what your project is and they *will* get back to you. Because if they don't then someone else will. 

The weird thing is that THIS IS A CORNER OF THE MUSIC INDUSTRY THAT DOES NOT NEED THIS SHIT. Recording/mixing/mastering engineers and musicians are all skilled and they have bodies of work that speak for themselves. They also have to hustle day to day just like anyone else. They need to take your call. SoundBetter isn't breaking down some barrier or flattening out the playing field. 

The world of A&amp;R, promo and marketing is just the reverse. You can't make a good record by just having the right friends but you can leverage connections to get something into print. Most music journalism is total garbage; I've seen plenty of Brooklyn Vegan articles that are obvious press kit copypasta. So when I see a website like SubmitHub it's like... horses for courses. 

&gt;To me, there's no better networking than going to shows, talking to artists, and having a decent web/social presence with some solid work examples to give you some legitimacy.

Most of my clients are one degree of separation away from me and just hit me up.

So when someone hits me up cold through social media and they don't know ANYBODY who is more than two degrees of separation away and they don' tell me which records of mine that they like then I figure it's spam.

If you have any more rare services to offer (maybe wind instruments v guitars, for example) that could be an easier path.

jlaqp55,1684853882.0,AskReddit,SmokeyCarmichael,"Networking with music professionals can be a great way to increase your visibility and chances of being discovered. Here are some tips to help you connect with music professionals:

1.	Attend Industry Events: Look for music industry conferences, workshops, seminars, and local networking events in your area. These events often attract a range of professionals, including artists, producers, managers, and record label representatives. Attend these events, introduce yourself, and engage in conversations with professionals who share your interests or are in positions relevant to your career goals.

2.	Utilize Social Media: Social media platforms, such as LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, provide opportunities to connect with music professionals globally. Follow and engage with individuals and companies in the music industry, participate in relevant conversations, and share your own music and updates. Direct messaging can be an effective way to initiate conversations and build relationships with professionals.

3.	Collaborate with Other Artists: Collaborating with other musicians and artists can help expand your network. Seek out opportunities to work with artists who have a larger following or have established connections in the industry. By collaborating, you can tap into their network and gain exposure to new audiences and industry professionals.

4.	Join Music Organizations and Associations: Look for local or national music organizations and associations that align with your genre or area of interest. These organizations often host networking events, workshops, and conferences specifically designed to connect musicians with industry professionals. Joining these groups can provide valuable networking opportunities and resources.

5.	Build Relationships with Local Music Industry Professionals: Research and reach out to music professionals in your local area, such as venue owners, talent agents, music producers, and studio owners. Attend local shows and open mic nights to connect with musicians, industry insiders, and other professionals who are active in your community. Building strong relationships with local professionals can lead to further connections and opportunities.

6.	Utilize Online Platforms: Explore online platforms specifically designed for connecting musicians and industry professionals, such as SoundBetter, Music Gateway, and Indaba Music. These platforms allow you to showcase your work, collaborate with others, and connect with professionals in the music industry.

7.	Be Proactive and Professional: When networking, it's crucial to approach professionals in a proactive and professional manner. Prepare an elevator pitch that succinctly describes who you are as an artist and what you're looking to achieve. Be respectful, genuine, and attentive in your interactions, and always follow up with a thank-you note or email after connecting with someone.

Remember, networking is a long-term process that requires consistency, patience, and building genuine relationships. Focus on creating meaningful connections, nurturing those relationships, and continuously improving your craft.

jjpiu4o,1683785666.0,podcasting,feedingacuriousmind,"Hey!

As an audio engineer and podcast engineer, I'd recommend finding some smaller podcasts you already enjoy or seek some out and see who their mixers are and see if they are available. I've had some good work through Craigslist that has turned into working on some major podcasts, so could be worth a shot posting on the gigs section there but that might require filtering through a lot of questionable people. I've also been hired through Soundbetter and Upwork for podcast work, so that could be a good place to post too.

&amp;#x200B;

Red flags I'd say are:

\- bad communication, even little things like misspelling words in emails could show a general lack of double checking one's work.

\- someone who doesn't seem like a genuine podcast fan - I've found the more I listen to the top of the line podcasts, the more I learn about their timing, music placement, foley etc which I can apply to my own work

When I first got started, I emailed all of the high school choir directors in my area, and they needed help at a district choir retreat where I showed up and lead the alto sectionals. I got my first few students that way, from connecting with kids in that environment. Now it’s a combination of social media presence, in person networking and word of mouth. A lot of times local music stores will be looking for teachers, one of my voice students works as a teacher in that kind of environment and my daughter takes piano lessons at a music store. The store will do the marketing for you simply by existing! 

Piggybacking off a few other comments, with a mic and Audacity or GarageBand, you can find session work online though Airgigs or Soundbetter. You usually need at least one finished song so people can hear you to decide if they want to hire you. If you have the mic but not the finished song, send me a message and I’ll see if I can help you out. 

If you can also play an instrument and write songs, you can make a couple thousand a year writing/recording for Songfinch (you have to audition, but if they accept you they’ll just send you work, it’s pretty great). 

The most important thing to realize is that not all, but a lot of musicians make money doing multiple things, and every little bit adds up. Start with one thing at a time so you don’t overwhelm yourself - whichever you think will be easiest to sell and make money is often the best first place to start, and then add on from there as you learn to manage your energy and schedule.

To answer your question re: vocals. I start by making my drums, bass, and melody at a BPM and key that I choose depending on style. Make a cool short track with the general idea of where it's going.

jdwihmh,1679941950.0,mixingmastering,atopix,"MANY things to comment on.

First. What he did here may be interesting as an experiment, but it's not how anyone should work with a mastering engineer. **He never communicated with them, he didn't listen to the feedback and he never requested revisions.** All of which is the polar opposite of [what's important about mastering](https://www.reddit.com/r/mixingmastering/wiki/importance-of-mastering).

Second. He practically never compared the masters to his original mix, he only compared them between each other, and not even level matched.

Third. In almost the entire range of money he paid, with the exception of Abbey Road and Metropolis, he seems to have hired mostly guys with nearfields and that's what happens when you go on Fiverr and SoundBetter. If you are going to hire a mastering engineer, make sure they at the very least have better monitoring than you do.

Fourth. He is completely right about hiring the online services of Abbey Road and Metropolis, both which are some of the very best mastering houses in the world, but for attended sessions or at least remote work hired through a label/agent. Their online service is like he calls it ""a black box"", where you don't hear peep from the engineers. It's a production line, it's not great (even though this guy thinks it is). For the price of every single rate he paid, he could have gotten to hire a professional who will personally work with you, give you feedback with full range monitoring (well, maybe except for the $20 bucks).

Five. Any idiot with a pair of headphones/speakers and a computer can give you a fuller/louder sounding master, the AI online mastering services can do that. A preset can do that. ANY of these guys could have given him a master matching the one he liked the most (if given the chance). That's not the point of mastering. Mastering is all about a professional second opinion, it's quality assurance: https://www.reddit.com/r/mixingmastering/wiki/mastering",50,,/r/mixingmastering/comments/123s53o/a_guy_on_youtube_pays_5_different_mastering/jdwihmh/,"MANY things to comment on.

j4ca6hx,1673720287.0,audioengineering,Azimuth8,"First things first, if you are interested in money then just about any other job on the planet would be a better bet than ""music"" mixer. If you enjoy working on music maybe keep it as a hobby while you earn money doing something that pays reasonably. Even live audio and broadcast are much easier to get into. Generally speaking (there are always exceptions), but the engineers that stick around long enough to get good enough and to meet the right people, will have sacrificed a lot (money, social life, family life) over the years. 

There is a traditional route that exists to get to the role of ""mixing engineer"" for the mainstream commercial industry. That being ""assistant engineer, recording engineer then mixing engineer"".  It can take many years, to not only progress through this hierarchy but also to develop the tastes and skills required to become a stand out mixing engineer. It took me 16 years working full time to get the the point where I was consistently putting out competitive, good sounding work and get into the fringes of the industry. 

But there is a major shortcut that exists, which basically cuts out the middle. I've seen several people go this way, and if you are serious about it, I would strongly suggest making this a primary goal, and that is working as an assistant to a busy working mix engineer. Not only are you exposed to world class working methods and sounds day in day out but you are also developing relationships with the people who can actually give you work. The importance of these relationships cannot be understated.  

Of course, this business has changed over the years and some people might just wander into the career as a mixer straight away, but frankly I don't really see how. There is a lot of knowledge you pick up even from just sitting in the corner of a studio making coffee now and again, that becomes foundational understanding and confidence as you develop. 

There are websites that exist where you can advertise your services like Soundbetter or Airgigs that gives you access to the large semi-professional market. A bit of luck and some hard work might pay off....The difficulty is standing out.",1,,/r/audioengineering/comments/105rrwa/what_to_do_to_become_a_mixing_engineer/j4ca6hx/,"First things first, if you are interested in money then just about any other job on the planet would be a better bet than ""music"" mixer.

There is a traditional route that exists to get to the role of ""mixing engineer"" for the mainstream commercial industry. That being ""assistant engineer, recording engineer then mixing engineer"".  It can take many years, to not only progress through this hierarchy but also to develop the tastes and skills required to become a stand out mixing engineer. It took me 16 years working full time to get the the point where I was consistently putting out competitive, good sounding work and get into the fringes of the industry.  But there is a major shortcut that exists, which basically cuts out the middle. I've seen several people go this way, and if you are serious about it, I would strongly suggest making this a primary goal, and that is working as an assistant to a busy working mix engineer. Not only are you exposed to world class working methods and sounds day in day out but you are also developing relationships with the people who can actually give you work. The importance of these relationships cannot be understated.   Of course, this business has changed over the years and some people might just wander into the career as a mixer straight away, but frankly I don't really see how. There is a lot of knowledge you pick up even from just sitting in the corner of a studio making coffee now and again, that becomes foundational understanding and confidence as you develop.  There are websites that exist where you can advertise your services like Soundbetter or Airgigs that gives you access to the large semi-professional market. A bit of luck and some hard work might pay off....The difficulty is standing out.","first things first, if you are interested in money then just about any other job on the planet would be a better bet than ""music"" mixer. if you enjoy working on music maybe keep it as a hobby while you earn money doing something that pays reasonably. even live audio and broadcast are much easier to get into. generally speaking (there are always exceptions), but the engineers that stick around long enough to get good enough and to meet the right people, will have sacrificed a lot (money, social life, family life) over the years.  there is a traditional route that exists to get to the role of ""mixing engineer"" for the mainstream commercial industry. that being ""assistant engineer, recording engineer then mixing engineer"".  it can take many years, to not only progress through this hierarchy but also to develop the tastes and skills required to become a stand out mixing engineer. it took me 16 years working full time to get the the point where i was consistently putting out competitive, good sounding work and get into the fringes of the industry.  but there is a major shortcut that exists, which basically cuts out the middle. i've seen several people go this way, and if you are serious about it, i would strongly suggest making this a primary goal, and that is working as an assistant to a busy working mix engineer. not only are you exposed to world class working methods and sounds day in day out but you are also developing relationships with the people who can actually give you work. the importance of these relationships cannot be understated.   of course, this business has changed over the years and some people might just wander into the career as a mixer straight away, but frankly i don't really see how. there is a lot of knowledge you pick up even from just sitting in the corner of a studio making coffee now and again, that becomes foundational understanding and confidence as you develop.  there are websites that exist where you can advertise your services like soundbetter or airgigs that gives you access to the large semi-professional market. a bit of luck and some hard work might pay off....the difficulty is standing out.",374

j39816v,1673043748.0,audioengineering,Fender_Gregocaster,"I get paid to do audio work but it kind of happened on accident. I learned how to make music so that I could produce my own music, then other bands reached out to me for help but my attitude was, ""sure, if I have the time."" This was after I had been making my own music for probably about 5 or 6 years. This was back in the mid 2000's so the competition wasn't the same as it is now. If you had a home studio at the same time that you're in a decently popular local band you were automatically a pretty popular guy.  


Fast forward 12 years or so and I kind of fell into doing this sort of thing as my main gig because it's the only thing I know intimately that I can provide value to people for (aka get paid) without killing myself for low wages in the construction industry (back surgery at age 32 was a bit of a wake-up call).  


Even with my experience and having somewhat of a built-in set of clientele, it's still extremely tough for me to make decent money at this. I mean I'm not struggling as much as I used to, but that's only because I'm married to an incredibly supportive wife who understands the ups and downs and we both bring in money for the household and our living expenses are relatively low. Things are looking up lately, but only after climbing out from under a rock and starting a YouTube channel to remind people that I'm alive and that I exist, and a lot of the new work is from people who already know me from prior work or from word of mouth. The channel isn't blowing up, but it's reminding people that I'm still around and doing this thing.  


There's soooooo much marketing that needs to happen with any business, even if you're really good. That's why Fivver and Soundbetter exist. They give you a platform where people can browse through a bunch of other freelancers who are also undercharging for their services. If you do well, you might get some good reviews. These reviews become your only differentiator unless you throw some extra services in that others don't offer (good luck with that).  


Here's the catch: You're renting space on someone else's platform, and you've basically commoditized your services. You're just another ""mixer"" or whatever, in a sea of mixers, where shoppers casually window shop, looking to pay less than a fair wage for ""a mix.""   


Not your mix, pretty much any mix meeting a certain threshold will do, and that's why they're looking on Fivver. What's worse is that these sites control your communication with your clients. All communication is supposed to happen through their websites, like visiting an inmate in jail. It's supervised and contact is limited. I hired a voice actor from Fivver and using the word ""email"" in a communication threw up automated red flags because some bot thought I was trying to communicate outside their platform. You can break the rules if you want I'm sure, but this last reason is why I'll never offer services on these sites. If I can't call, text, or video chat about a project that someone is paying me thousands of dollars for I'm just not comfortable with it. I might be missing out on some work for sure, but I don't want that kind of work.

I've never considered myself particularly good at this in my own opinion, but clients are always really happy and they always come back, so I guess I don't suck too bad, or maybe I'm just not a dick, in a world of dicks, I dunno. That's the other thing: People hire people that they like. If two mixers are up for a gig, the more likable person is more likely to get the gig if all other things are equal. So make sure your networking skills and people skills are just as sharp as your audio skills, because both are about equally important if you want to do this for any sustained amount of time.  


Long story still long AF as fuck, I don't think there's anything wrong with you just fucking going for it. True, there's room for potential embarrassment if you're still green when people are paying you, and some people who have been doing this for even less time than I have will get pissed at you for it, but fuck them. As long as you're providing value and giving people something for their money and they're happy with the results you've given them, what's wrong with that?  


The most disturbing thing to me about the whole thing is the reminder that Fivver is still a place where overworked audio engineers are racing each other to the bottom of commodity pricing, and the musicians who need to hire us for things start to believe that $50 is a reasonable rate for mixing a song.

You can search all types of spots online. IG because you can see mostly everyones credits. But you will have to DM people and hope they get back to ya. It isnt easy

Soundbetter is an alternative that has a ton of producers on it ranging from intermediate to professional. With everything on it as well, writers, singers, mixers etc. 

And obviously here but its a crazy mixed bag from complete beginners to maybe some professionals but highly unlikely unfortunately. 

Secondly for someone who wants to make a song. You really need to know how to explain and describe what you are looking for and at least have the song written or a very good idea on what or how you might hear it. 

The fee you are talking about paying will maybe get you someone in the intermediate stage. That person might be a musician but hasnt worked with anyone major and might be pursuing a career for themselves but hasnt found the right path yet. 

Anyone above in the pro range might charge between 3500-5k. If you are an awesome artist, there might be some wiggle room if they see something special in ya.

If you are new, anyone might sound better than nothing but make sure to always ask for a link to check out their music &amp; to see their credits even if they havent worked with anyone major.

Fighting piracy was a stated goal from Spotify from the beginning.  And if you look at the trends, that is effectively what happened after Spotify/streaming took hold in the US... piracy went down and recorded music revenue went up.

It’s always possible to find good solutions for the specific phase that someone is in. No need to generally make a decision on whether you outsource everything or not.

To give you an example: Maybe doing a great EP (with a professional engineer) is a better option than doing a mediocre album with the engineer from SoundBetter who you can easily afford but doesn’t live up to the expectations.

Generally on the budget question (return on investment): I would  highly recommend you spend a bit more and only get mastering compared to spending less but get mixing and mastering. 

If you work with a seasoned mastering pro (for a rate between you 100 and 200 USD), you will usually get incredibly valuable advice on what to tweak in your mix (or even in the composition and production) to generate a high quality end product.

irbmzjj,1665086318.0,edmproduction,kauziiofficial,"First of all, you're doing a great job pushing yourself to the next level of producing by finding vocalists and originality. I've only worked with a few vocalists but holy hell it is a new beast to master other than producing instrumentals so here are some tips:  


1) Choose your favorite website for singers and plan your budget!   
I used to dig through fiverr but I personally like ""SoundBetter"" because those freelance people are insanely talented but at a higher cost. I think its more worth it than fiverr  


2) Reference Singers!   
This is a big one: Pick a singer you already enjoy listening to and find SIMILAR voices of that singer that match the vibe of your track! I sometimes think HALIENE is on my instrumental but theres no way Id actually get her to sing on it, so I track down similar voices like her and it totally fits the vibe that I was going for in the first place!  


3) Be reliable!   
Singers would love to work with you but you need to have the money already in hand to send them and also your idea. Singers are a whole different talent and they deserve to be respected just like you, so make sure you're making them feel comfortable and fun to work with. A lot of singers are not huge producers so make sure you translate your ideas to them easily. Its more of social skills but itll help in the long run if you tell them how to execute your vision in your head for your track  


4) Pre save singers  
I usually take a day to save the singers I prefer to work with in the future on a website of my choosing, like 10 should be good (make sure you have money). I like hearing their demos and imagine myself working with them and matching the track of their voice in my head. Saves a bunch of time and it prepares my budget before a actually message them. Then when I feel like im ready, I dm them and go from there, shouldn't be complicated.   


Bonus: I know money is hard to get and shouldn't be wasted so easily so make sure you choose the right singer-songwriter and work your day job or something to fund yourself.",15,,/r/edmproduction/comments/xx6gsf/best_place_for_solid_vocals/irbmzjj/,"First of all, you're doing a great job pushing yourself to the next level of producing by finding vocalists and originality.

You listen to their portfolio, and compare it to stylistically similar, commercial-grade releases.

&gt;what is the price you should expect

This varies greatly based on location, market, and how many famous credits they have. You can think of it this way. How much would you consider a professional's time to be worth per hour? What's the approximate number of hours you'd expect them to work on your mix? Set a minimum/maximum range for your answers to both of those questions, and now you have a ballpark range for price.

Now, if they have famous credits, they can easily double that price based on that reason alone. But, keep in mind, there are many great engineers out there that don't have famous credits. This is why listening to their portfolio is the most important thing.

&gt;where should you look

You can look at the credits of your favorite albums and contact those engineers. Or, SoundBetter is okay too -- better than Fiverr at least. Feel free to add me to your list of considerations too if you'd like. If you Google my name, you can find me on SoundBetter, as well as my own personal website.",3,,/r/musicproduction/comments/xd2nny/should_i_hire_a_mixing_engineer/io8kok3/,">But how do you know if someone is good You listen to their portfolio, and compare it to stylistically similar, commercial-grade releases. >what is the price you should expect This varies greatly based on location, market, and how many famous credits they have.

So, it's very good that you write songs on regular basis, but you should love your songs, you should be proud of it. I think it's better to spend more time on creating and to miss some regularity but find something really cool.

The only question you need to ask yourself about your songs: ""Is it really cool for me? Do I really love it from first to the last note? Does it inspires me?"" (Yeah, that's 3 questions already, but they are about one thing that I'm trying to explain). And if you can't answer: ""Fuck yeah, I really love that shit!"" - you need to work on it little bit more. Or make something another.

The best way to improve your stuff is to find a professional producer to work with. I write my demos, I send it to him, and we make it better together. He changes something and I accept that or not, but anyways it's much better than to do it by myself only.

I can recommend to go to to SoundBetter to find a specialist to work with. And yeah, there are really good producers that work with very heavy music.

ikjnu2l,1660671115.0,mixingmastering,atopix,"Some personal recommendations:

1. NEVER EVER pay extra for ""mastering"" to the same person who did the mix. Mastering is traditionally done by an expert in mastering, someone who will be listening to the mix with fresh ears in a controlled environment with full range monitoring, it's a quality assurance stage. [More on this here](https://www.reddit.com/r/mixingmastering/wiki/importance-of-mastering).
2. If for budget reasons you can't afford to pay a separate professional for mastering, then you won't be doing quality assurance, you'll just be getting a loud master from your mixing engineer. That's okay, but don't pay extra for it because it's just mixing. Ideally find an engineer who isn't even marketing it as mastering. Anyone who mixes can give you a loud master. If they can't, then don't work with them.
3. Stay away from platforms like SoundBetter, Fiverr, Upwork, etc. They are *not* good places to find professionals and engage in a good professional working relationship.

So before getting into where to find professionals to work with, let's talk about money. While there is generally some correlation between the engineer's experience and how much they charge, hiring a very expensive engineer is NO guarantee that they'll be a good match for you or your music.

Work with someone *you* like, someone you think is cool, that strikes you as having a similar creative sensibility as you. Of course that's much easier said than done, but that's the key to any successful creative partnership. Music is a very subjective thing, so are people's personal tastes.

I can guarantee you that there are PLENTY of solid mixers in the $100-$300 range.

Studio guys will always want to sell you the *whole* package. Once more, I don't recommend one-stop shops. Want a music producer? Someone who will work with you to develop and flesh out your music/performance, maybe even play some parts themselves, program beats, tune vocals, etc. Find someone that does *just* that. More often than not they'll have at least their own small studio where they could do basic vocal tracking, and they are likely to be fairly decent at mixing.

Want to go to a studio to do good tracking? Just go there to get your recordings and then you can get those mixed *anywhere* by anyone.

If you already can get decent recordings done yourself, if your music is already working at a musical level and just needs a better mix, then just hire a mixing engineer.

So where do you find people to work with? Look up who engineered the music that you like, obviously the higher caliber artist that you look up the more expensive and out of reach the engineers they work with will generally be, but even so don't be too quick to look elsewhere. Find out who this engineer's assistants are, they all very likely charge half or even a quarter of what the engineer they assist does, and they will be intimately familiar with their way of working, they'll often have the same approach and similar taste.

Whoever you are interested in, research them deep, stalk them on their socials, find out what kind of persons they are to figure out if they'll be a good match for you.

Peruse Gearspace forums, in which most english-speaking professional engineers hang out, many of who will have their website/socials on their signatures.

And also, while generally there's overall ess experienced people here, this subreddit is also a good place to find more affordable mixes but still with direct contact with the engineer: https://www.reddit.com/r/mixingmastering/wiki/guide-request

There are other sites like SoundBetter which are specifically for music production, but they all have the same problem: They create an environment in which if people don't already know of you, or you don't have some serious credits, then you are forced to lower your rates just for the privilege of getting to have some positive reviews.

And you don't get to have any direct communication with your clients, to me it's absolutely crucial that I have an open line of contact with my clients, and my clients with me, and that we can reach out to each other outside of one specific gig. That's how you develop a lasting working relationship. They often email me to let me know when the thing I mixed for them is released, I can add it to my portfolio, and I can also share it on my socials which in turn helps them.

On those platforms communication is tightly controlled by them, so almost none of that can happen.

&gt; Building a portfolio. I obviously won't be able to charge for a service without some examples of my work, but what are ways that you could build your portfolio when you're starting out? Did you mix your friend's tracks for free? Or use some royalty free multitracks online?

Most of the freely available multitracks online are *not* royalty free, but you can still use them in your portfolio to show what you can do. If you are afraid of sharing that publicly (no reason to be, I've had some of those in my portfolio for like 15 years), then share them privately.

And then yes, do some free mixes for friends, or mixes for favors, get whoever you mix for to buy you a plugin that you'll use in the mix, etc. You can find recommendations for all of that in the wiki: https://www.reddit.com/r/mixingmastering/wiki/practice

Once you have a little portfolio of some solid mixes to show, start heavily networking, reach out to bands and musicians who are at a similar level of experience on their music as you are on your mixing.",11,,/r/mixingmastering/comments/w8sthd/im_looking_for_advice_on_starting_to_provide/ihr9nnm/,"> What sites work for operating a service like this?

ihal6ln,1658558384.0,Songwriting,vgvf,"offerings will vary wildly by producer. a producer is traditionally a project manager, but they can also offer writing, tracking, performing, mixing, mastering, etc. some will be able to make everything in the box, others will hire talent.

the bad news is, its going to be expensive, or low quality, unless you are very lucky and find someone who is willing and able to do a lot for a little. you could even try something like r/BedroomBands or r/MusicInTheMaking, but generally the less you are able to contribute, the less likely someone will want to work with you.

if you're really dead set on getting a song produced without being a musician yourself, your best bet is to find some way to communicate your ideas (record yourself singing it, find a friend who can strum a guitar and piece it together, just any kind of demo you can make) and research full service producers in your genre (soundbetter looks great, i haven't used it), then talk to one about your vision. if they think they can accommodate you, they'll be able to give you a quote. and don't forget those subreddits if you are able to demo something that could inspire someone to help you.

make sure you know exactly what you can and want to contribute. are you just handing off the idea and $1000 and expect a finished track? thats fine, but be prepared for it to come back and not be at all what you expected. are you going to want to provide input at every step? arranging, tracking, mixing, etc. that's fine, too, but every iteration is more time on the clock, and time = money. and to be clear, i would be shocked if you spent less than $1000 on a  production of any quality. i know you said to ignore cost, but it will be one of the most significant factors in your production, and it will constantly make decisions for you throughout the process if you don't plan for it.

also, a producers goal is to satisfy the client, not necessarily produce a hit record. when the client is a record company, sure, those goals might align. just keep that in mind. some producers will push back, but others will absolutely put a ping pong delay on a harpsichord in your dream pop track if you think its cool. you should know which kind of producer you want.

or get a cheap midi controller and a cheap mic and just do your best. chances are your first song is going to suck no matter how much money you spend on it. might as well be a cheap lesson. but who knows, maybe you'll catch some lightning in a bottle.",3,,/r/Songwriting/comments/w5u51d/whats_the_process_to_get_your_music_produced/ihal6ln/,"offerings will vary wildly by producer. a producer is traditionally a project manager, but they can also offer writing, tracking, performing, mixing, mastering, etc. some will be able to make everything in the box, others will hire talent. the bad news is, its going to be expensive, or low quality, unless you are very lucky and find someone who is willing and able to do a lot for a little. you could even try something like r/BedroomBands or r/MusicInTheMaking, but generally the less you are able to contribute, the less likely someone will want to work with you. if you're really dead set on getting a song produced without being a musician yourself, your best bet is to find some way to communicate your ideas (record yourself singing it, find a friend who can strum a guitar and piece it together, just any kind of demo you can make) and research full service producers in your genre (soundbetter looks great, i haven't used it), then talk to one about your vision. if they think they can accommodate you, they'll be able to give you a quote. and don't forget those subreddits if you are able to demo something that could inspire someone to help you. make sure you know exactly what you can and want to contribute. are you just handing off the idea and $1000 and expect a finished track?

ieoliyi,1656844713.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,frankiesmusic,"Hi, i'm an Engineer, let me share my thoughts.

About money:

There are ""extremes"" that doesn't (very likely) pay off. A 20-30 bucks for a master it's 99% made by some unprofessional, so if this is your budget, it's better to spare that money and do it yourself, they can sound cheap, but you are just trowing money away to someone who doesn't really know how to do it.

200+ bucks they may be top engineers with analog equipment and this can sound amazing, BUT. You are not famous, so very likely they will give your song to someone else to work with, maybe an internship, or an external, so you pay for the best one and you got a someone else. I worked for years for other studios that way, cause they were ""famous"" but preferred to keep working with big artists, but instead reject minor artists, they gave me the songs to work with, they ask big money, my prices are more fair, so i get my fee for my job, they get their money for do nothing.. well they just use their ""brand""

&amp;#x200B;

About how to chose:

This is a russian roulette for different reason. First i dislike online services, automated or something like fiverr and soundbetter. The automated are just bad, you pay for an eq and a compressor/limiter, the AI is miles away from an human, at least for now.

Other services (fiverr/soundbetter-like) make the purpose to receive a good review/stars, so the engineer doesn't really work for your song, rather than make some average decision to try to do not disappoint you, and this can be different from make a proper master, expecially for semi-professional mixes. If the mix is made by a professional mixing engineer, as mastering engineer i'm sure i have to fix very little issues to none, otherwise i also have to care about too much to fix the mix before the real mastering session, and this can shape the song you are used to ear a lot (not always ofc, but it can happen) and some people, i whould say 50% of them, when ear something that it's ""very different"" can feel disappointed, cause they are already used to that issues, and they sound fine to them, even if it's very wrong, and this will lead to a professional and good master, but a bad review. Time to time i see on reddit people that come here telling they are disappointed cause their mix sounded better than the master, they post both, and people say the master is way better.

So imagine you to be the seller, the only stuff that really matter if you wanna work, are the ratings, you just need a bad one to screw up your profile, you know even 4 star out of 5 it's ""bad"" 

&amp;#x200B;

With that said you are still left with your question, would be easy for me to say to reach me for your music, and ofc you can if you want, but trying to be more objective what i can say, is that isn't easy to find the right guy to work with that may care about your music, not just your money, so try to live this research more as jurney till you find the right one",14,,/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/vqcmd8/any_recommendations_for_a_mastering_engineer/ieoliyi/,"Hi, i'm an Engineer, let me share my thoughts.

iej2spn,1656727734.0,musicproduction,onemanmelee,"Hey, I'm an independent musician too and I often hire people for things like this. It does depend on budget, but it doesn't cost a fortune. If you look on Soundbetter and Airgigs, there are people for this purpose.

Eg - I have a string guy I've hired several times. My last album had 5 songs with strings and he did all 5 for \~$500. He does anything from a small group (solo, trio, etc) to a full string section where he records like 8 takes of violin, 6 viola, 6 cello from different chairs/angles. I know he is actually doing this cus when he sends over the waves, there are like 20 takes and they aren't duplicates (ie no phase issues). They mix together beautifully. And yes, it sounds like a big string ensemble. He also sends a stereo mix for convenience.

I write my own arrangements and just send him the midi. He prints it out to sheet music and does the rest, even allows revisions and etc. His profile says he can also write arrangements if you don't do your own.

I once hired a brass band in the same way. That was a bit pricier at \~$350, but it was make or break for that song, IMO, and worth it. The difference from midi to live was unmistakable.

Of course, if you were really doing full orchestras (strings, woodwinds, brass, etc) then yes it would add up, especially if it's on numerous songs. So it depends on budget and needs.

For me, I decide where VSTs can get it done and where they can't. I have a few new songs that will need strings and will def use my guy. I think it's worth it if you're going for that truly natural and warm sound.

In the end, budget, number of songs, etc change the conversation, but I have no regrets making such hires to get my songs to that next level. 

If you have any questions just ask, as I regularly use drummers/bassists/horn players/harpists/etc to get my work produced, so I'm pretty familiar with the process.

ibnxm2b,1654727727.0,audioengineering,AlexRomeSound,"Hey!! 

I run a 6 figure freelance audio engineering (mainly mixing) business at a fairly young age. 

It's a hustle like everything else out there.

I'll write this with the assumption that you mix well enough to consider your skill sellable.

**Here are some things that helped me start and grow my mixing business:**

**Getting clients.** Here is a list of the main ways I use (and used) to get clients:

1. Build a Youtube channel talking about audio engineering. This is the best way to get traffic to come to you instead of having to go out and find clients. This is also the only way I use now to get clients and build my book (I'm Alex Rome on YT with almost 250k subscribers). Content creation is so effective because it builds trust with prospective clients on autopilot. 
2. Build an Instagram and post content about audio engineering and mixing advice. Instagram is cool because of how easy it is for people to DM you. 
3. Leverage freelancing sites like fiverr, Soundbetter (my fav), and Airgigs. Freelancing sites are great for getting traffic to come to you. As you build a list of good reviews on any of these sites, they will start to naturally boost your profile to the top of the page so that visitors of these sites see your profile first. The result is an endless stream of prospective clients. This takes time, but it's worth it.

**Start cheap and get reviews!!!** In the beginning, you'll have to be cheaper than your competition. The purpose of this is to get as many reviews as possible so that you can leverage these reviews to get more clients. Reviews are the number one thing that will get people to trust you enough to hire you. The more reviews you get, the better. So be cheap or even give away work for free in exchange for a review. 

As your online presence grows with more content, subscribers, followers, and reviews, more prospective leads flow in. This is when you can begin raising your prices. Slowly replace your cheap clients with high-paying clients. Get rid of your pain in the ass clients too. Some clients feel like they own you and aren't afraid to ask for too many revisions, refunds, or just take up all your time with pointless requests. Replace these clients with clients who trust your results and who take the least amount of time to please. 

My most lethal secret for building a lucrative 6 figure mixing business is to build up your reviews on [Soundbetter.com](https://Soundbetter.com) while simultaneously building a big social media following on Youtube and Instagram. This way, you have two big pools of traffic sending you clients. This system (if done right) will take you about 3 to 5 years but will feed you for a lifetime. So it is well worth it (:

Feel free to ask me any questions you'd like! Hope this helps.",2,,/r/audioengineering/comments/v7ode6/whats_the_best_way_to_start_a_freelance_audio/ibnxm2b/,"Hey!!

I use a guy who will do large and small arrangements. He plays violin, viola, and cello, and for like $100-150 a song (discount if I do a few at once) he will take my midi arrangements, print out the scores, and send me the files. Sometimes it's just a trio, or sometimes it's an orchestra where he separately layers like 8 violins, 8 violas, 6 cellos, or whatever.

iark7ck,1654073299.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,guysthisisserious,"Ahh, the age-old conundrum of quality vs expense! I feel you. There’s no way around it when you’ve got finite capital and time and energy.

This is kind of a case of managing expectations - if you work with a professional, most likely the results will be professional. If you work with someone less than professional, it will probably sound less that professional. 

Not to say that you can’t find a diamond in the rough, when it comes to hungry, young, producers! Just be aware that you may spend time and energy anyway, and still be left with a disappointing final product. As far as finding them, scour local music spots and talk with other musicians. Word of mouth recommendations will probably yield a better fit than a Google search. There are undoubtedly up-and-coming producers that are willing to work for small budgets.

There’s also a site called [ItyDity](www.itydity.com), that lets you set your budget, and then producers vie for the opportunity to work on your song remotely. You remain in control a little more than SoundBetter, and the site helps you along the way.

And lastly, I just want to add, in case there is any feeling of apprehension about self-recording/self-producing; you can do it. Yes, it is a skill, and yes, it takes time to get results you’re happy with. BUT in the long run, it will pay back dividends a hundred times over. Every artist I work with that has some recording/production knowledge is infinitely better equipped to make good music, even if they’re paying me to produce. And I have never met an artist who truly could not do it.

The internet is full of a ton of recording advice. It may seem daunting to wade through, but I know plenty of singer-songwriters that have made great works of art in their bedroom with the slimmest of budgets and equipment.

Ofc it's pricey but it's always all depend on how much serious you are with your music, if it's just a passion and you want to do the best YOU can do, everything is fine ofc, otherwise a professionist can do more, because his skills but also because he have a fresh pair of ears, and can bring a different vision on your music.

I hear what you mean about the bassline in the first tune. You’ve got abit too much mids (200-400hz) going on. 

TBH, hire an engineer. You’re mixing issues are pretty subtle and a decent stem mastering job will fix them. If you’re based in or near a large city you should be able to find a an engineer where you can do an attended session and that’ll be a big learning experience. If you can’t find an engineer in your area I recommend www.suturemastering.com Dude is based in australia, he’s pretty cheap and he does good work.

EDIT: Read your other post about lackluster engineer. Finding a good engineer is a whole process. More $$$ doesn’t always = better mix/master. All the really expensive guys are pop engineers and will tend to mix your tune like a pop record. But you should be able to get a good mix/master for less the $300-400. It’s sort of like hiring a barber. You just try different people until you find somebody who vibes with your aesthetic.

If you can spare the $$$ it’s worth trying out multiple engineers on the same song and then build a relationship with the one who does the best job.

i mentioned suture, Bot also does mixing/mastering https://twitter.com/bot106 hit him up.

Good to know! I hope payments don't have to occur through the platform? If so, could definitely be an issue. 

I am always really clear and careful as to when payments occur for services. If the mixer mixes with no down payment up front then he is at risk. If the client pays 100% upfront, then he is taking a lot of risk. A lot of people having issues didn't properly set this up to reduce risk. 

I don't have a lot of experience with paying for mixing, but when I pay contractors for other work, I pay part up front and part upon completion so that we share the risk. 

I think the same thing makes sense for mixing, so when I paid for remote mixing recently, I negotiated 50% up front with the other 50% due at completion.",1,,/r/audioengineering/comments/twsej5/how_many_of_you_mix_without_the_clients_attending/i3jon2g/,"Thanks for the link!

If the mixer mixes with no down payment up front then he is at risk. If the client pays 100% upfront, then he is taking a lot of risk. A lot of people having issues didn't properly set this up to reduce risk.  I don't have a lot of experience with paying for mixing, but when I pay contractors for other work, I pay part up front and part upon completion so that we share the risk.  I think the same thing makes sense for mixing, so when I paid for remote mixing recently, I negotiated 50% up front with the other 50% due at completion.","thanks for the link! i read through all the replies. it doesn't seem like too shady, just really poorly run. it seems like soundbetter should only be used as a listing service and not as a reliable arbiter to settle payment disputes. you can't count on them to refund payments as if they were paypal. good to know! i hope payments don't have to occur through the platform? if so, could definitely be an issue.  i am always really clear and careful as to when payments occur for services. if the mixer mixes with no down payment up front then he is at risk. if the client pays 100% upfront, then he is taking a lot of risk. a lot of people having issues didn't properly set this up to reduce risk.  i don't have a lot of experience with paying for mixing, but when i pay contractors for other work, i pay part up front and part upon completion so that we share the risk.  i think the same thing makes sense for mixing, so when i paid for remote mixing recently, i negotiated 50% up front with the other 50% due at completion.",195

I also base it on what I'm working on. Ie for my main project last album (and will do the same next album) I found someone with a great work history (ie - similar artists) and great results. Paid several thousand for the mix/master, but absolutely worth it. Results were amazing. Hoping to have next album ready to mix by \~summer, and will be looking to work with him again. 

Recently I finished mixing an album for a side project which is less important to me, and is more straight forward (\~punkish).

   Hey guys,

I'm looking for a part-time virtual assistant that is proficient with Google and knows about what's hot on Instagram / Youtube / TikTok. 

This is to help me and two artists I'm managing. Someone who loves/is knowledgable in music is a plus!

&amp;#x200B;

Tasks I'm looking to have done

\- Search for music venues hosting events matching our needs

\- Finding event promoters near specific areas to help connect with our artists

\- Finding venues around the US to shoot music videos / photography sessions

\- Help find influencers that will fit the music we're trying to promote

\- Finding services (photography, film, other artists) matching what we need on sites like Fiverr, SoundBetter, Upwork, etc.

\- Finding Spotify playlist curators that best match the music we're trying to promote

\- Writing curated or template messages to all of the above (I will be doing to contacting, you just need to find and write a message)

\- Help us brainstorm content for TikTok based on what upcoming artists are doing

\- Manage different components to projects we're working on (like following up on people we're waiting on, finding a specific service we need done, etc)

I hate to see people give up on music because of the lack of success, so I try really hard to make sure people keep the joy of music in general in mind.

I'm really happy for you friend! No worries, I don't need names, I trust your word anyways considering your extensive background. Me saying there's small labels etc isn't something I've *experienced* myself, but something I think has to be true because it just has to, it can't not. Getting confirmations like these makes me very happy O:)

As for soundbetter and vocalizr, no I've never hired anyone there, only browsed, so I wouldn't really know. I know the general listed prices and the quality of the vocals people have gotten there and that's it. Personally I'm broke as fuck, so even the starting prices are all too high for myself, but I figured I'd mention them in case you didn't know - I had no idea about the increasing of a price during the work itself :/  
Anyways, I just wanted to make sure you keep alternative methods in mind. For someone used to hundreds of dollars for a single vocal, fiverr would be a goldmine of shopping for example. Yeah, most on there aren't the best, but for the price it can end up being worth it. I'm sure there's some site or other somewhere where you could find a reasonable vocal consistently for a mid-tier price, but I haven't found one yet myself.  
Thanks for the info though, I'll be more careful now if I ever choose to use soundbetter etc, keeping an eye out for increases in costs, so you might have saved me a bit here.

For the fifth one, yeah you're right 100%. However, for me, I'm broke, so the money needed is the first step anyways in my case, hence why I didn't focus on strategy (I just don't have the experience for that yet, and I figured you'd know better than me anyways).

Fourth: Thank you. That's really all I want out of any of this. Keep music, ditch the business if you have to, but if you like music, do music. It's fun when you let it be, and my philosophy is to keep the fun parts alive as long as possible

First. I agree, smaller labels often do a better job than big labels that sees producers as a naive musicians.   
I have a friend that was tied to Ultra music who never really promoted him. He made a second allias and found Actuation when it still was small. They did a fabulous job with him, he’s really happy. (Sorry I can’t give names)

Third. Soundbetter and stuff are good, but have you ever purchased a vocal from there? it can start at 300$ but it can easily go to 3k. There are plenty of ways to find vocals. But if you want a hit song, you need killer vocals, and those are usually expensive. I sometimes make my own top lines or work with singer-songwriters that I know can do the job I need… anyway vocals are a big discussion for another time…

Fifth. It’s not always about the amount of money you put into promotion, it’s about the strategy. You could give me 100k now but if I can’t reach to the right people or if I don’t know how to use that money, then it’s useless. The most successful artists have great teams behind them. The main reasons I stuck with big labels, are the fact that they can provide you with a good strategy, they add some value / prestige and give you exposure. I was disappointed many times.

hpfhqsi,1640098510.0,edmproduction,PM_ME_BOOB_PICTURES_,"This is sounding really familiar to me.  
I have a few pieces of advice, from someone who's seen enough of the music industry: Depend as much on yourself as possible, instead of the label. Labels like Spinnin don't care about your passion, your vision or your grand talent, they're a successful business and those ones tend to get very, very focused on money. If you want to go for a label like spinnin, leave as little work and money for them as possible, there's always cheap ways that work better than what that label could do. Spinnin is exposure and status, and a manual cannon that launches you, but you have to choose where to aim yourself, otherwise it goes straight down and you stay where you are.  
If you want to go for a label, and you want to gain things not mentioned above from them, go for a small one. You have the status and resume now, you can line up a bunch of labels and figure out which ones are the best fit for you as an artist, not which one is the biggest moneybag. That way, you'll get people that care about you, that want to see you grow and that will stay involved with you because they believe in you.  
Hell, I got lucky and randomly switched distributor to Beatchain and apparently they fucking love me. They keep promoting me, interviewing me and asking for updates and chatting etc despite me being pretty much nobody, because they're small, and they have the right people for me. Dan especially is just the best, i swear to god one day I'll meet him and give him a giant hug.

  
Second piece of advice, or rather just information: You got scammed. Hard. Spinnin puts no effort into their cover art etc, and it definitely isn't worth what you paid. You make them money, so they're making sure you keep doing it. Leave them immediately.

  
Third: r/bedroombands is a great place to find vocalists etc when you need that, and it's free. Otherwise, follow your own footsteps and check out fiverr for that stuff. There's also vocalizr and soundbetter for more premium stuff, but the people on Fiverr are more likely to want to work with you, instead of just completing their work assignment and be done with it.

  
Fourth: fuck money. Do you like producing music? Great, then keep producing music. If you have to work at a gas station to pay the bills while you do it, so what? You get to produce music! 

  
Fifth: Don't fuck money. Contradicting myself here, but if you want your music to get heard, and you're not putting money into it, then you're probably relying on luck, and that's not good for business. Same advice as above goes for this one too: Find people who care about YOU. The smaller the company, the more likely they have people who are just really excited about this shit. Surround yourself with those people.

Or don't, you can cover your own promotional expenses too. It's slower and less of a fine-tuned process, but it's yours and you're the one in control.

  
Sixth: THis is pretty much the same as the first advice, but rephrased: When a label, person, company or whoever brings up expenses, PROs, cover art, you name it - Make it your own business. They're practically telling you how you don't need them, by giving you the terms and names of things to research for your own sake, instead of letting them handle it which is always going to be crazily overpriced (unless you got a great small label who cares for example).

Seriously. The money doesn't have to be a problem. People who just graduated art school will make a fucking masterpiece for a fraction of the cost spinnin quotes you for their stock photo burglaries.

hp1vv1j,1639838761.0,drums,Zack_Albetta,"Well, that's kinda my point, nothing is typical for me. Recording an album over the course of a week...how many songs? At my place or someone else's studio? Will recording this project myself be a good opportunity for me to learn something new about recording drums? Is it an old friend of mine who I love playing with or is it a stranger who kinda sucks? Is there a producer or engineer attached to the project whose radar I really want to be on? Is the client a huge commercial corporation or a broke-ass singer/songwriter? 

I'm sorry to come back with more vagueness but you see how many factors there are here. I get that you're looking for a number. On Airgigs and Soundbetter, I charge $120 per track. But that's just on those platforms, which represent a small percentage of the recording work I do, and doesn't mean that's what you should charge. I set that number based on what I know about myself -  that no matter what comes in, even if it's dogshit (which it sometimes is), that number is motivation enough for me to suffer through one track long enough to do a good job. On those platforms, I feel like that number is kinda in the middle of the price range. Many rates are way more or way less, and the quality of the work doesn't necessarily keep pace with the price. That number is going to be different for you based on your experience, your availability, your tolerance for bullshit, etc. 

So that's online. In person, in your community, what are other session musicians charging? How much experience do they have? Are you the only game in town or are you a small fish trying to work your way into a big pond? Are there constraints on your time or is your schedule pretty open? Is there competition for your time or are you just taking gigs as they come? 

There's a meme going around of two cowboys in a standoff. One says ""What's your rate?"" The other says ""What's your budget?"" This is the recording game in a nutshell. Even top cats like Aaron Sterling have a sliding scale based on all the factors I mentioned. I read an interview with Kenny Aronoff from years ago where he was talking about how some producers and MDs he had previously worked with were lamenting ""I really want you on this project but I can't afford you anymore."" Kenny would say, ""well, what *can* you afford?"" and take it from there. I respect that a great deal. Even for one of the biggest baddest cats ever, doing the work and cultivating the relationship are more important than adhering to a specific rate. 

I would say generally these days, most session musicians' rates are per track. But that rate varies wildly and is often tossed out the window for any number of reasons - charge more because of this, charge less because of that, charge a flat rate instead of a per track rate because blah blah blah. If you set a rate and say ""I *will not* work for less than X,"" you are inevitably going to miss out on work. Use your judgement. The number between what is enough for you and what is too much for the client is usually a moving target. Reading the situation, being flexible, and finding that sweet spot is going to result in more opportunities. With some projects, you'll be less willing to be flexible and not lose any sleep by turning it down. With others, you'll be all too happy to bend over backwards to make it happen.",2,,/r/drums/comments/riylc9/how_did_you_work_out_your_pricing_for_session_work/hp1vv1j/,"Well, that's kinda my point, nothing is typical for me.

hn99qj7,1638661452.0,audioengineering,Many_Slices_Of_Bread,"Very exciting! But also strong agree here. You will be hard pressed increasing the prices for this friend later on to a level that is remotely worth your time. I just mixed a 10 song album for my friend, and spent between somewhere in the ball park of 500 hours on it (I did some production and re-recording too though). Even so my base price for my first tracks was $220 (I'm australian, so $AUD, which is a lot less than $USD), which ended up being less than $12 an hour.

If this is $USD I would definitely reccomend charging like at least $100 per track. Cause each track should take you at least 8 hours to mix.

So if he loves your mixing he will ask for your work again, or reccomend it to his friends. They will probably prices in the ball park of what you charged before. Even if you x4 your previous price for the 2nd album ($120 a song), it isn't commercially viable in the long run.

This is from ASCAP website:

""Budget. So how much does a good mixer cost? Mixes are usually charged per song, and there’s a very wide range. Here are some anchors, based on actual prices that thousands of engineers have provided at SoundBetter:

Someone with better mixing chops than you but starting out professionally might charge around $200-300 per song.

For $400-600 you can get a fantastic mix from an engineer with some recognized credits. This is a sweet spot for many serious indie musicians who want quality, but are self-funding and price sensitive.

If you know where to look and get lucky, for $600 - $1,500 per song you can get a mix from a name engineer who mixed some hits and might even have some Grammy nominations or wins.

The world’s top mixers, whose mixes you hear on the radio every single day, charge $5k-$10k per song at their prime, and in some rare cases get fractions of points on future royalties in addition to their fee.

TL:DR I don't have a straight answer. Do whatever you want, and be mindful if you follow a guide for 200,000 other people on how to market yourself, that method stopped working once that video posted.

This tends to not sit well with musicians but it's easily one of my favorite ways to get a more objective ear. I would invest a good $500-700 on a song I don't make at all if I were you. Go on Soundbetter or even Fiverr and vet the top producers into Oblivion, and find one you really like.

Have them make the entire track for you. The reason for this is if you don't make it, you can be far more objective over if it's ""good"" or if it ""has potential"" and personal bias will have no way to cloud your thinking.

Post it under a new artist name, and try doing the same things you were doing under your own artist name, compare the results. I hate to admit this, but, my ""art"" the folk music I wrote at rock bottom. Songs about grief, and love, and everything I care about never got traction.

I look back and I had no idea what commercial sound was. Even indie acts need to know this. Check out Cobi, and JT Roach, or anyone full time but not viral. Noah Kahan is a good example of ""Commercial art"" lol.

If you want to build your music ability into an objective, worthwhile product, still you, still your perspective, I think separating yourself from the learning process is very helpful. I get a lot of heat for this tip but you'd be surprised what it can do for your craft.

Also I have said this in other threads but I am only making around $1,000 a month right now. That's my personal monthly income. I have an LLC and am making a good bit more but I have operating costs at this point. I can go into that if you want.

I am easily the least talented person I know in a room full of professionals. I get some positive feedback every day, but the majority of it is constructive criticism.  Most of these people are industry professionals in some aspect.

Music Supervisors, Producers, writers, song pluggers. If I didn't have these connections I'd ask for other artists to review my work. That's one of the few consistent ways I think you can grow as well.

Ask any genre relevant creator who hasn't blown up, to give a full review of your track, and then post the review, tag them, and thank them. It's good because they know you're asking them for their artistic insight, it's a favor to you that boosts their ego a bit, and taps into their fan base and shows their audience they are worth the time of others.

I think that when you're going against the entire music world from hobbyist to pro, doing what anyone else says to, publicly, even this rant of a follow up, isn't what's best. This is what I tend to tell people in person:

""The music industry is filled with gatekeeping, and outdated mindsets. Dinosaurs from the 90s charging for college radio, bot driven playlists, marketing gurus who haven't actually done anything charging a months rent to show you what FB ads are.""

I hope that makes sense )","i'm actually going to set aside what i am doing as it will more than likely just cause confusion. if you'd like more info on that dm me. with that said... tldr i don't have a straight answer. do whatever you want, and be mindful if you follow a guide for 200,000 other people on how to market yourself, that method stopped working once that video posted. this tends to not sit well with musicians but it's easily one of my favorite ways to get a more objective ear. i would invest a good $500-700 on a song i don't make at all if i were you. go on soundbetter or even fiverr and vet the top producers into oblivion, and find one you really like. have them make the entire track for you. the reason for this is if you don't make it, you can be far more objective over if it's ""good"" or if it ""has potential"" and personal bias will have no way to cloud your thinking. post it under a new artist name, and try doing the same things you were doing under your own artist name, compare the results. i hate to admit this, but, my ""art"" the folk music i wrote at rock bottom. songs about grief, and love, and everything i care about never got traction. i look back and i had no idea what commercial sound was. even indie acts need to know this. check out cobi, and jt roach, or anyone full time but not viral. noah kahan is a good example of ""commercial art"" lol. if you want to build your music ability into an objective, worthwhile product, still you, still your perspective, i think separating yourself from the learning process is very helpful. i get a lot of heat for this tip but you'd be surprised what it can do for your craft. also i have said this in other threads but i am only making around $1,000 a month right now. that's my personal monthly income. i have an llc and am making a good bit more but i have operating costs at this point. i can go into that if you want. i am easily the least talented person i know in a room full of professionals. i get some positive feedback every day, but the majority of it is constructive criticism.  most of these people are industry professionals in some aspect. music supervisors, producers, writers, song pluggers. if i didn't have these connections i'd ask for other artists to review my work. that's one of the few consistent ways i think you can grow as well. ask any genre relevant creator who hasn't blown up, to give a full review of your track, and then post the review, tag them, and thank them. it's good because they know you're asking them for their artistic insight, it's a favor to you that boosts their ego a bit, and taps into their fan base and shows their audience they are worth the time of others. i think that when you're going against the entire music world from hobbyist to pro, doing what anyone else says to, publicly, even this rant of a follow up, isn't what's best. this is what i tend to tell people in person ""the music industry is filled with gatekeeping, and outdated mindsets. dinosaurs from the 90s charging for college radio, bot driven playlists, marketing gurus who haven't actually done anything charging a months rent to show you what fb ads are.""

hj09e6i,1635858531.0,ThisIsOurMusic,CanIEditThisLater,"Good stuff, thank you for sharing. I can only imagine what kind of a trip down memory lane listening to those old tapes and then re-recording them must have been. Really cool.

Some others in this thread have shared their input when it comes to mixing the vocals and I can completely see this from both angles: The way you did it and the one others have recommended, putting the vocals a bit more forward.

In case you want to go in the direction of putting the vocals a bit more forward, here are a few things I have found helpful in my journey (apologies if you already know or use those, in that case maybe someone else might find this helpful). Three are free, one is paid (but really good). To the mods: I hope it's OK, to post this here, I'm not affiliated with any of these companies.

1. Get a free [SoundBetter](https://soundbetter.com/) account, log in and click ""My Account"" - ""Member Benefits"" to get free licenses to iZotope Neutron &amp; Ozone as well as Mastering the Mix Expose, which are all great tools for mixing and mastering. Expose shows you potential problem areas in your mix.

1. Regarding gluing the mix together, there's possibly no better free option (Patreon donations accepted) than putting [Analog Obsession BUSTERse](https://www.patreon.com/posts/busterse-42658623) on the master bus to give it a vibe similar to using an SSL bus compressor.

1. Since Black Friday is coming up: There might be a sale of the insane Wavesfactory tool [Trackspacer](https://www.wavesfactory.com/audio-plugins/trackspacer/). It automatically makes space for vocals (or anything else) in your mix by ducking just the frequencies that might be clashing, making it very transparent.

1. An option somwhat similar to Trackspacer is [TDR Nova](https://www.tokyodawn.net/tdr-nova/). It's a dynamic EQ that's a bit CPU intensive, but free.

And here's the most important thing: If you guys are happy with the mixes, don't do anything to it. Thanks again for sharing and good luck with the marketing!",2,,/r/ThisIsOurMusic/comments/qkjksx/when_i_moved_house_i_found_a_shoebox_of_dozens_of/hj09e6i/,"Good stuff, thank you for sharing.

Title: **Soundbetter.com provided me a fake PayPal Transaction ID for a job and they’re blowing off my attempts at contacting them.**

Original Post: 

&gt; Came here because I don’t know what my next course of action should be. 
&gt; 
&gt; Recently became a provider for audio production/mixing/mastering work on Soundbetter.com after using the website as a client and being satisfied overall with it and the process.
&gt; 
&gt; So I got my first job (mixing and mastering for 2 songs) the client funded the job and I worked on this project very diligently for about a month. Overall…no problems. I saw where the money was funded and completed the job when my client was satisfied. 
&gt; 
&gt; Well….after I completed the job, I noticed the money had not shown up in my PayPal. I did some digging and saw that I had the wrong email address for PayPal (100% my bad) this should be an easy fix, right? 
&gt; I’ve had to send several emails before getting an actual response from the support at Soundbetter. They provided me a Transaction ID so I contacted PayPal….
&gt; 
&gt; PayPal tells me they have no record of that Transaction ID and that it could potentially be fake. I tell Soundbetter this….no response. Just that they’re “looking into it” 
&gt; 
&gt; I have to send several emails just to garner a response, and it’s always a short half assed response like they don’t care that they owe me an explanation for this mess.
&gt; 
&gt; I’ve called the support number several times but there’s never an answer. Left several voicemails explaining the situation…but I feel I’m not being heard.
&gt; 
&gt; What should I do? It’s $700.00 that I’m owed and they’re just blowing me off.
&gt; I’m definitely never using Soundbetter again….I just want the money for the work I did. 
&gt; 
&gt; Do I have a case here? It’s not like they’re a small company. They’re partnered with Spotify for god’s sake.

I think what they did is automate the threshold of the limiter on the master channel so it pushes harder on the drops, therefore if feels louder than the verses. but because it's so compressed it just feels squashed? idk if that makes sense to u but i'd ask for the plain mix and maybe try doing the mastering yoursel if they can't get it right.

Don't get me wrong, if clients are resonable this system could work, but unfortunatly a lot of people hire someone not because the knowledge of the engineer, but to feel better with himself, but when the engineer send them something they don't like it's a mess, even if the engineer is the professionist who know why had to fix bad production decisions, but someone just don't like to listen his song to sound different. So a that point the engineer on that kind of platform must make a choice, be a real professionist, but then he get a bad rating, or just follow what the client want (i'm not talking about smal revisions ofc) to get a good review but doing a poor job.

As engineer i feel this is a bad service, that's why i've left that kind of service, because i prefer to let clients listen my previous work, and talk with them, explaining what's happen, what's my role, before beeing hired, then i can do my job for the best of the song, if the client understand my knowledge and my fresh ears can bring something usefull to the song.

I see, and i've talked with some other engineer that work there, and you guess what? They told me they stoped to make what they would do normally, but they just limit themself to fix issues to let the song to sound more close to the production as possible, then they do revisions client ask for, and this is work.

I feel myself different, i didn't chose this job to work like a dumb, but because i like it, and i like to put 100% my knowledge, take some ""brave"" decisions, to make the song to sound best as it can, and sometime this mean to change the vibe of the song.

i.e. i had a damn beautifull pop-rock song to master, i really loved, but the mixing was done by the producer i think, and it was a mess. Mastering isn't about fixing mixing, anyway the producer didn't had the budget for the mixing so asked me to do whatever i can to make it sound better, so i've talked with him explaining how i work, and my philosophy, at the end we was super happy not just because i fixed 70% of the mixing issues, but also because the song got a very different vibe and he liked a lot. 

Another time i had the samish story with an hip-hop song, i've done the same talk and so, but the rapper really disliked, because he wasn't ready to listen the song in a different shape, i've asked him what should he changed and guess what? What he was asking is something more closer to the production, that was completly wrong. I told him we spoked before about this, but you know everyone is different, so understanding it's hard.

If you want to give to the artist the finished product, probably the best way you can do is to search for a mixing/mastering engineer you know, or you like how his past work sound, and include his fee in what you charge to your artists.

As mixing and mastering engineer myself, i can also say, that there is not a perfect engineer, because something is tecnical but some other stuff are just matter of taste and decisions, so if you don't know yet an engineer and you should looking for one, i suggest you to start with one song only and see how it goes, don't hire someone for multiple songs so you can try if it works for you.

Talk a lot with the engineer before doing anything, i usually do it with artists and producer to let them understand how i work, and how my philosophy is, i.e. i'm not on sounbetter because i think the ""rating"" are just a bad way to be a b\*tch that do everything the client say for a good rating, and with the respect for the producer and the song itself, i'm the engineer, this mean i'm the one with a specific knowledge, and i'm also the fresh pair of ears that can bring something different with an unbiased opinion.

I'm an engineer, and i dislike soundbetter, and honestly i dislike the ""stars"" rating, because they do not tell the true, and you know because you are unsatisfied by a 5 star engineer, and you gave 5 stars.

I also dislike soundbetter because i'm an expert engineer, and not a b\*tch, and this kind of services, for the sake of a good review make you as engineer, to do whatever the client want, and this is wrong and now i'll explain why.

You are the producer, the song and the money are yours, and as engineer i fully respect it, anyway, you don't have my knowledge, and you are used to listen the song to sound in a certain way, while soundwise i could shape it a lot, this could make you a bit disappointed in the ""usual"" soundbetter like way to work.

My workflow and the way i prefer to work, is without ""stars"" or ""b\*tching"" myself, but i like to let the producer listen what i've already done with other songs, so he can hear if my sound, could fit it song and his taste, this doesn't mean he will be 100% happy ofc, but as part of my experience and professionality, this is a part of the prior talk before start to work on the song.

Imo you are not just paying someone to make your song to potentially sound better, but also another pair of ears with enough professionality and knowledge to have some bravery if needed to make some important decisions on how some element could sound. Unfortunatly this is something lost in the ""rating"" era, because some producer doesn't just want a real engineer to do their work, but they are just looking for a bias to feel comfortable about this song, and as i can see, a lot of 5 star rated engineers, do very little changes, that usually are just some clean up, a bunch of compressors to make the song to sound louder and call it a mix. But this is not a mix imo

The client asked for an arrangement/orchestration, so I arranged a portion of the song as a sample and sent it. The client was overwhelmingly fascinated -which I found a bit weird since I didn't actually put that much effort on it- and funded the proposal.

After completing the arrangement, and doing unnecessary -the client finally realized that first version was the best one!- revisions twice, the client disappeared and never replied back! Although all the messages that I sent to him was getting marked as ""Seen"" quite a few hours after! 

I reached out support by Email and they assigned an intern to help with the issue. After three weeks -the actual project took one week to complete- the support intern said that maybe it's a good idea to negotiate with the client on a partly refund. The strange thing is that the support intern asked me to negotiate the issue with the client! I had to re-inform the support about the fact; *""That's what I'm actually seeking help for in the first place! I contacted you since I can't seem to reach the client!""*

A month passed and the support reached me informing that the client is not happy with the output! I didn't observed any progress from the support in 2 months and I felt my both client and the support are wasting my time, after two months of repeating the obvious and not getting to the problem so that we eventually come up with a solution.

I was still confused after registering Analog Lab Lite because there does not appear to be a download for Analog Lab Lite or Analog Lab Intro available even after registering the product - but I saw via websearch that the download needed is the same download as Analog Lab V, but the registration status determines whether the ""lite"" or the ""full"" features will be available.

h4cbn4e,1625656523.0,edmproduction,FelineFantastic,"I tried fiveer only once and that was enough to never use it again. I know a lot of people have had some positive experiences with it so maybe it can work for some peeps, but I stay away from it like.

Have you tried soundbetter. The majority of vocalists there are well versed in recording and working professionally and it is significantly more expensive but you really get what you pay for.  I've used it a fair bit and never had any issues. Also you are protected against vocalists disappearing after payment because they only get the funds once you decide the stems have been adequately delivered. The only issue I have was when covid happened and one of them could no longer access the recording studio, and soundbetter just cancelled it and returned all my funds.

The hard part though is finding the RIGHT singer for the song. It can take days and days of listening to demo's. You can't rush this process. This is where you might be going wrong. You can't judge just on a demo either, you have to check out their spotify and youtube and listen to a lot of their work to be get a FULL picture. One demo can be very misleading, as they can be very wet but usually you can hear more of their dry sound on their adlibs they may do on Ytube or insta. It seems like a very time consuming process but there is no way around it if you want it done right. Sometimes I never find the right one and I give up that particular tracks search, as its better to have no singer than go with the wrong one, but sometimes you find the ONE that you identify as perfect right away and each listen to more of their work just confirms that more and more, then you know you found it. 

 I suspect you just havn't looked hard enough for the right artist when selecting, so you are not getting the result you want. It ain't easy,  and as I said its expensive in both money and time, but when it works out, the results are pretty golden. My advice to take with grains of salt, search for at least a wk, in the $350+ range, don't look at number of reviews but look at number of returning clients, (people with hundreds of reviews but all one offs Vs people with fewer reviews but a few of the same returning clients is preferable), and stay away from fiveer.

Also you don't need to have worked with someone on soundbetter for them to leave you a review.  So if you've get any clients from anywhere else, local, fiverr, etc. You can ask them to leave you a review.

And look through all the categories on there and see if there is anything else that you fit into. I do think editing is still one, but if you play an eclectic instrument that doesn't have much representation on soundbetter... If you write music in a specific niche genre... Anything to make yourself stand out.  And gear your page specifically towards that one thing.  Don't try to be a jack of all trades.

Mixing is completely saturated on soundbetter.  Almost impossible to break through the noise unless your credits are absolutely insane.

Unfortunately, I realized it’s as feasible as expecting to be a unicorn. As a result, I’ve bounced around several paths only realizing each time that I’ll never escape the music urge, as much as “bowing out” tended to appeal to me. I know a lot of uber-talented musicians that work unrelated day jobs for this same reason, and the more I learn about “the streaming era” the more I’ve attuned myself to the self-promo methods it takes. No avoiding it. At a certain point I said to myself, doing whatever it will take to get there is better than a life avoiding it. Sounds like you’re at that point too. 

I’ve heard from engineers at some of the biggest studios in the country that even when you land a permanent job it’s an unsubstantial wage. This comes from the bottlenecking of demand for those jobs among music lovers, same as in the market for actual musicians, music journalists, etc. I don’t blame studios; they’re in deep trouble. The big acts today often just record with a C800 in a hotel room, so unless you’ve booked Adele for the year, revenue is hard to come by. 

Not being all doom &amp; gloom about it though; I know engineers who made a name and got great credits from those studios and used that to get big freelance work. In a way, freelancing is a fun challenge to be creative. It motivates the musician to learn how to produce, the engineer to learn how to mix, etc. 

Getting on sites like SoundBetter and Fiverr is always good. In my experience living in LA, where there’s a world-class studio on every block, your chances of making a name are actually better in a smaller city where you can strike a niche. Especially in a time where the Internet and Covid have made remote freelancing that much easier.

Saving up and building a studio, maybe partnering with some fellow musicians, is always on my mind. A Neve console and a rack of vintage outboard helps attract clients. Another good idea is teaching; lots of people will pay to learn these skills, myself included. Fixing/flipping gear is a great way to meet people too.

I can't speak for Komplete but I'm a hip-hop producer and have Omnisphere too. Both Analog Lab and Omnisphere are amazing. Only bad part about Analog Lab is there's not much editing you can do to the sounds, whereas in Omnisphere you have full control. Analog Lab requires the V Collection in order to have full control, which is annoying. It's basically a large preset library without it. But, the sounds inside are incredible and there's a ton of variety. And for $39 you can't go wrong. 

I don't have Komplete, but from my research, the main thing that'd be good for hip-hop is Kontakt, and Komplete comes with quite a few libraries for it. Most are piano libraries though so if you have anything like Keyscape, Addictive Keys, or Analog Lab, you'd be fine without it. The guitar and bass library it comes with might interest you. But if you did just want Kontakt alone, you can get a free library called Arcane by Embertone and then you get a discount on Kontakt itself. This would be cheaper than buying Komplete but you also get less libraries for Kontakt, and none of the other plugins Komplete comes with.

gzrfoej,1622211698.0,indieheads,samdyalexg,"in case of paywall:

&gt;Music streaming can be something of a catch-22 for fledgling artists: You can’t break through without impressive streaming numbers, and it’s hard to get impressive streaming numbers without breaking through.

&gt;Spotify is making an attempt at leveling the playing field. On Wednesday (May 26th), the streaming service announced its new Fresh Finds program, which will spotlight indie musicians in marketing campaigns and equip them with a variety of educational tools. The program is a spin-off of the Fresh Finds playlist, which has added more than 25,000 emerging artists since its launch five years ago. In 2021, about half of the artists added to the playlist previously had fewer than 21,000 monthly listeners, but the average artist sees their listens increase by 108% in the month after being playlist, according to Spotify in a new blog post. The streamer positions Fresh Finds as a launching pad, citing the likes of Clairo, Omar Apollo, and Amine as alumni.

&gt;Marian Dicus — Spotify’s VP, Global Co-Head of Music &amp; Global Head of Artist and Label Services — says the playlist’s success made the company realize that doing more for this type of artist was the “next logical step” in Spotify’s commitment to independent artists. “Where we can provide personalized, one-on-one support, I just think that’s really meaningful,” she says.

&gt;The first four Fresh Finds program artists are Wallice, Unusual Demont, Julia Wolf, and EKKSTACY — each of whom have less than a million monthly listeners. Going forward, there will be two groups a year. Dicus says both Spotify’s marketing and editorial teams are involved in the selection process. Spotify first used an algorithm to identify data-related growth both on and off platform, taking things like blog coverage and social chatter into consideration, before editors waded through the music itself. For now, the Fresh Finds program is U.S.-only, but Spotify is expanding the reach of the Fresh Finds playlists, adding new regional versions in 13 territories including the U.K., South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as other parts of Asia, Europe, and Latin America. “I wouldn’t be surprised if this is something that [eventually] rolls out on a larger, multi-market basis,” Dicus says. She says Spotify is also open to the idea of taking submissions for the program in the future if there is enough demand.

&gt;Spotify will provide all involved artists with a “personalized masterclass” as well as credits to use on Spotify for Artists resources like Soundbetter, where artists can hire designers to create Canvases. (These classes are basically crash courses with Spotify executives on the ins and outs of audience growth and networking.)

&gt;Spotify will also offer one-on-one mentorship opportunities with “established artists as needed,” though this component does not seem as fleshed out as others yet. The initial idea was to connect current class members with Fresh Finds playlist alumni — “but they might tell us, ‘Actually, I’d really love to talk to this crazy, incredible artist who’s known by all globally,'” says Dicus. “So, it depends. We don’t want to give it strict parameters. It’s about partnering them with people they feel like they can learn from.”

&gt;Meanwhile, the company’s publishing team is pairing the foursome up with established producers to create original songs that will be released in June under the Spotify Singles banner. EKKSTACY will work with The Drums’ Jonny Pierce, Unusual Demont will work with The Idiot, Wallice will work with both Marinelli and Ariel Rechtshaid, and Julia Wolf will work with Jackson Foote, who is one half of production duo Loote. Dicus says Jonny Pierce is an “idol” of EKKSTACY’s, and Wallice, also, has “always wanted to work with Ariel.” While Marinelli is already Wallice’s only long-time collaborator, the new team-up will see Wallice working with two different types of sounds in a co-production situation; Julia Wolf has also worked with Foote in the past.

&gt;Perhaps most importantly, Spotify will feature the artists of the Fresh Finds program in a “major marketing campaign on- and off- platform,” which includes docuseries-style content on social media.

&gt;Wolf — a Queens-based artist with the smallest following of the bunch — tells Rolling Stone that she’s getting a billboard in Times Square. “Years ago, I’d be walking through Times Square and looking at all these billboards,” the singer, whose genre-free music often melds electric guitar with pop and hip-hop beats, poetic songwriting, says. “You don’t understand how people get to that point; You just feel really lost in it. I was confused, and I just didn’t know anything about this industry. For Spotify to take the time to look past big streaming numbers and following count, and just look at the artist, the message, and the music they want to share… It’s unreal.”


&gt;Wolf prides herself on being very hands-on and DIY in everything that she does, from music to visuals. While she only started releasing songs in 2019, she’s been writing and preparing since high school. “Those were the ‘eating lunch alone in the music room’ days,” she says. “I knew from that point that this was what I wanted to do, but there were so many dead ends in trying to find people to help me. Half of it was being too afraid to ask people for help, because you’re just a shy kid. The other half was learning to produce, sending songs out, and getting them back unrecognizable. I just couldn’t find the right people to help bring to life what felt really clear to me.”

&gt;While streaming services are often critiqued for not paying the majority of artists, songwriters, and rights-holders a living wage, they do provide global exposure — and so have stripped record labels of a considerable amount of power in the last decade. “Spotify and streaming have driven the democratization,” Dicus says. “But now there’s so much out there. That’s really why we built these tools and resources for this community. You will continue to see us investing in this area just to give more options to artists.”

&gt;How much of Spotify’s new Fresh Finds initiative, then, is a pointed response to bad press about not being artist-friendly? “Listen, it’s complicated,” Dicus says. “The people at Spotify are really the most incredibly passionate group of people who care deeply about supporting artists and democratizing the industry. I think we take [the criticism] on the chin. We know we’re the biggest global streaming platform; it just comes with the territory. We really support artists big and small. We also say, ‘Okay, 57,000 artists now represent 90 percent of monthly streams on Spotify, and that number you can see has quadrupled in six years.’ Is it frustrating sometimes? Yes, sure, but it doesn’t bother us that much. Our job is to just build a ton of resources and tools. You might not use all of them, but you have the optionality, and that’s incredible.”

On Wednesday (May 26th), the streaming service announced its new Fresh Finds program, which will spotlight indie musicians in marketing campaigns and equip them with a variety of educational tools.

gx7izgx,1620341438.0,audioengineering,sw212st,"It depends on your budget. 

This might sound silly, but it is often unfortunately misunderstood and surprising to many, that anyone can approach any mixer (or at least their manager) and ask for their rates and availability. You don’t need to be signed to a record label or famous you just need to have budget and in many cases make music the mixer is into.

I think a lot of smaller or unsigned artists fear rejection but so many names in mixing who you might think are untouchable and only do major records will still get involved in a project if they like it. Budget wise though you should be prepared for some eye watering rates which can be impossible if you don’t have a label behind you or a rich dad. 

I can’t help but feel that soundbetter can be misleading. It is social media meets linkedin and we know how social media is used to show you what people want you to see rather than the whole truth. Certainly I know people who I wouldn’t trust mixing records are on soundbetter self promoting in a pretty dishonest way. 

My advice would be to listen to peoples work. Consider that a mixer can’t turn a shit into a hit, they can only enhance what is already there so listen to a cross section of their output and jump on an email if their manager will allow for that- the bigger the engineer the more protective a manager will be about direct contact but don’t be afraid to ask. 

If you’re working on tighter budgets then you might find a more more engaging experience with a local studio but there is no reason not to work with someone half way around the world if they will accommodate your budget and are into what you do.

glk3jc9,1612150596.0,Songwriting,njrous,"I haven’t used Soundbetter or Fiverr but I usually charge $75 per song, and for a 5-6 song EP I’d charge $300-375 (one song free basically). Here’s the production company I work with (I’m Nick for reference lol) [Terranaut Recordings](https://www.terranautrecordings.com/)

As far as artwork goes, I have a few graphic designer friends Ive turned to, and depending on how artistically proficient you are and how elaborate your idea is, you may be able to do it yourself. 

Usually you’d have them all finished before rolling out singles, and the traditional route is 2 singles before the release for albums, so you might even want to consider 1 if it’s an EP. But essentially for this kind of thing, the single has to serve as hype, the idea is that after listening to it the listener will want more and follow you on social media, join your mailing list, etc. so they could hear the rest. Then your release will do better on the initial day. 

Another aspect that you didn’t really mention is getting reviews, which is super crucial! I’m not sure if you didn’t mention it because you were already familiar, but reaching out to blogs and playlist owners and writers to talk about your music brings awareness to it and get your music to more people.

glk1jgv,1612149594.0,bedroompop,MoMoDaLandShark,"You’ll have better luck with SoundBetter than Fiverr if you’re looking to get any work done through a site like that. Getting any decent quality work done on Fiverr would be surprising. SoundBetter will probably yield higher quality results but you’ll definitely end up paying a bit more for it. You’re probably better off getting into contact directly with an engineer. A 5-6 song EP will cost however much you’re willing to invest in it and you’ll probably get results equal to the size of that investment. That being said, there’s definitely no reason to go spend thousands of dollars, especially on your first EP. The main thing that’s going to require budgeting is the fact that you’re ideally going to want to have a different engineer handle each stage of the song. Production and mixing you can usually get away with using the same engineer if they’re willing to do it, but mastering should definitely be handled by a separate engineer, just due to the nature of that specific process. Your best bet would be to find an engineer who will produce and mix the whole thing for you first. Obviously you can hunt around Instagram and social media for an underground engineer and DM them. You can also post a request over in r/mixingmastering and probably get plenty of responses to choose from. They’re also very helpful over there if you have any further questions. 

As someone else already stated a lot of basic artwork can be done yourself nowadays. Canva is a fantastic free resource that’ll allow you to create something you’re happy with, as long as the idea is relatively basic. If you want actual, good quality artwork then hunt around on Instagram or Twitter and find some artists you like. They’ll probably have a link to submit a commission request and if they don’t you can DM them to ask. 

Here’s the tricky part. In my personal opinion you probably shouldn’t release an EP at all right now. EPs used to be a great introduction to an artist that would allow them to demonstrate a small range of their work in a concise package. Unfortunately, with the rise of streaming, this is no longer a feasible marketing scheme. Listeners have short attention spans, and prefer playlists featuring various artists more than long form releases by one single artist. Obviously artists still release Albums and EPs, but this is typically done by larger artists or at least by artists who have been able to generate some hype. Albums are expensive to make and if you don’t already have a following no one is going to listen to a 10+ track album from an artist they’ve never heard of, let alone a five song EP. Your best bet is releasing some singles first. Generate some buzz on social media around each one and try to make sure you’re getting decent attention for them. As awful as it sounds, a good place to generate hype is Tik Tok. There are numerous ways you can generate buzz there as an artist without resorting to stupid dance trends, just do a little research into how musicians are marketing themselves on Tik Tok. Do a bit of marketing and release one single and see how it fares. Learn from that process and release the next one even better, then rinse and repeat. Once you actually have some people that care to listen to what you put out then you can start putting together a strategy for releasing a whole EP and it’ll face a way better (and less soul crushing) reception than if you had just dropped the whole thing out of nowhere. 

That’s my take on releasing stuff after having spent a good few years working with professionals on both sides of the industry. Hope it helps!

1. Try some vocal stacking especially with the response parts during the chorus
2. Possibly also try some rhythmic plucky guitar parts during the chorus 
3. Cool vocals during the bridge, you could still expand on them even more 
4. Guitars are very loud after the bridge and as a result, the mix really starts to sound compressed 
5. Maybe this is something you’re already planning on doing, but I’d recommend looking for someone on Soundbetter or even fiver to melodyne your vocals for a more polished sound (mainly in the verses)

I don't think that excludes the possibility of being ignorant regarding the role professional mastering plays. People ARE being taught the value of good engineering and good mixing, but are not being educated even remotely equally on mastering.

&gt; Here on the subject of Fiverr/Soundbetter folks (disclosure, I do some work on Soundbetter), u/atopix, we need a little context.

It's just a simple of example of the many kinds of things any bedroom producer is exposed to, which will influence their understanding of mastering.

&gt; The same pattern of economic stratification we see in other sectors of the economy hit musicians and thus the whole music ecosystem. So people seek to lend their more experienced ear to other processes like mastering. 

I'm not sure what argument you are doing here. You first seem to suggest that things are leaning towards being less specialized, but then you end by saying that more experienced professional lean towards doing mastering?

&gt; just because you are, say, a mixing engineer, doesn't mean you can't pull off a great master of a track mixed by someone else.

It doesn't, if we understand ""mastering"" as just some processing, which is the point I'm making myself. But that's not my definition of mastering.

&gt; Some thoughts before we condemn folks who advertise ""Mixing and Mastering"" as a service

Mike Dean is certainly not offering mastering services.

&gt; My two cents is that it's 2020, not 1987. Things are shifting, often times in remarkably good ways, and we've got to roll with the punches not cling to old to norms (even if they helped create some beautiful tunes).

All the more reason for mastering engineers to adapt. Like [I argued recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/mixingmastering/wiki/importance-of-mastering), I think professional mastering is more relevant now than ever before.

Couple things here. In OP's original question, we're talking someone who has the experience to recognize and seek after an idiosyncratic sound with the perspective necessary to make informed decisions about that sound. Know the rules before you break them kinda thing. Here on the subject of Fiverr/Soundbetter folks (disclosure, I do some work on Soundbetter), u/atopix, we need a little context. When the the framework of a segmented production/mixing/mastering process came to be, there was a ton of money in the music industry. This process allowed people to become extremely specialized. 

That is definitely not the case now. The same pattern of economic stratification we see in other sectors of the economy hit musicians and thus the whole music ecosystem. So people seek to lend their more experienced ear to other processes like mastering. 

&gt;Obviously any experienced mixing engineer can produce something that will sound as good and as loud as a master made by the average professional mastering engineer on 90% of playback situations.

As you mention above, the general concept of adjustment by another party in a treated environment whose ears you trust is basically what a master has been since digital. This is a little bit of an anal point, but just because you are, say, a mixing engineer, doesn't mean you can't pull off a great master of a track mixed by someone else. Some thoughts before we condemn folks who advertise ""Mixing and Mastering"" as a service - either, but not both on the same project. 

&gt;Maybe mastering engineers will have to start making their own YouTube channels and Twitch streams so that they can stay relevant in this day and age.

Gut feeling is I see an extremely harrowing road for young mastering engineers who want to specialize in just that. Passion projects and the top 5% of musician earners (totally pulling this number out of my ass, ballpark though?) are the projects which can be funded in a way that would be sustainable for an engineer. Those jobs are going to experienced people. There are companies like iZotope selling snake oil. Online algorithmic ""mastering"" services totally brutalizing people's music who know none the better. So, diversify and be resourceful.

geccheq,1606888338.0,indieheads,ashleyjanamusic,"I have a campaign that I wrote about Spotify that pertains to this question. Here it is below in block quotes:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;[**SPOTIFY IS ABUSIVE TOWARDS MUSICIANS BOTH RICH AND POOR, AND HERE IS WHY**](https://ashleyjanamusic.medium.com/spotify-is-abusive-towards-musicians-both-rich-and-poor-and-here-is-why-a34792353f02)  
&gt;  
&gt;I just personally released a controversial audio recording of [Jim Anderson](https://angel.co/company/spotify/people), a Spotify Inventor (described as [“The man who built out the system architecture of Spotify”)](http://syncsummit.com/ny2019agenda/). The prominent Spotify Inventor was abusive to me and to all of the other musicians in the room on June 14, 2019 at the NYC Sync Summit at Les Poisson Rouge, and I caught it all on tape. Just search [“Spotify Inventor Calls Musicians Entitled”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrmWJruDAoU&amp;feature=youtu.be) to hear it for yourself on Youtube.  
&gt;  
&gt;Spotify is abusive towards celebrities who speak out on behalf of the entire music community. Spotify tried to stop the streaming rates from increasing just recently, and when celebrities spoke out against it, [Spotify CEO Daniel Ek attempted to discredit and blame the celebrities by claiming they only make albums once every 4 years and that they need to work harder.](https://hypebeast.com/2020/7/spotify-ceo-tells-musicians-to-work-harder-record-more-stop-complaining) Meanwhile, that’s a flat out lie. There are 100 people on that list of celebrities who spoke out, some of which are incredibly famous and are working harder than ever. This one really gets me heated because I’m a massive fan of everyone on that list. So in short, Daniel Ek employs passive aggressive covert abuse on his victims in order to protect his incredibly one-sided and close-minded opinion.  
&gt;  
&gt;Spotify owns an online marketplace called SoundBetter, and even though [Daniel Ek just spent literally one billion dollars on “moonshot bets”](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/24/spotify-ceo-to-invest-over-1-billion-for-moonshot-bets-in-europe.html), Spotify can’t seem to afford a staff for their platform SoundBetter so the music professionals can be protected. Instead, [the platform has a D- on the Better Business Bureau website](https://www.bbb.org/us/ny/brooklyn/profile/music-composer/soundbetter-inc-0121-185893?findTypeaheadInput=&amp;nearTypeaheadInput=Astoria%2C%2BNY&amp;country-select=en-us), and Spotify chooses to uphold the harshest terms that I have ever seen in my life, for no good reason. Spotify is willing to be abusive to the professional musicians of the world who are working hard to make ends meet. The abuse comes in the form of avoiding, ignoring, and withholding protection from the music professionals who are in need of help, and it’s all for literally no reason. They could easily do the right thing, but they simply don’t care enough to, and it is the most disgusting thing that I have ever seen a company do in my entire life. I care about people a lot and I don’t have to know someone personally to care about them. I care about all of the music professionals on all of the online platforms. I also work on another site that protects the artists completely. So it is something that I have become insanely passionate about. I’ve gone back and forth about whether to say something about it for a long time, but I realized that if no one ever says anything, nothing will ever change.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is a very inspiring solution that can be found within the idea of revamping the infrastructure to be more interactive (with new video features as well), but Spotify refuses to look in the mirror and face their own shortcomings. Spotify is abusing the entire music industry when they imply that the possible is impossible. The only thing that seems to be impossible is getting Spotify to care about people. And as for Spotify’s reasonings about why they choose to show up in court to block the streaming rates from increasing — all of those math equations that they use are meaningless when applied to the idea of a revamped infrastructure because you wouldn’t have to even start with a rate change — you would just add a marvelous marketplace and a whole lot more interaction. I have a whole list of things I came up with for that idea, it is so inspiring to me!!  
&gt;  
&gt;In conclusion, this is what I have personally observed when it comes to Spotify’s abusive behavior towards musicians both rich and poor. There is also a very real solution that could solve the problem of artist compensation — revamp the infrastructure to be more interactive, fun, engaging, and just everything you could ever want. If you need ideas, let me know because I already have a very long list.  
&gt;  
&gt;My new idea doesn’t even need to touch streaming rates or raise the price at all, and I can see a shimmering rainbow of ideas for it that is wildly creative, dynamic, and fun.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pop culture as we know it could be better than ever before, but only if we take a stand against the falsehoods, the heartlessness, and the passive aggressive covert abuse. In other words, Spotify needs to stop abusing musicians, and they also need to stop abusing show business!!  
&gt;  
&gt;If Daniel Ek wants to discredit celebrities using lies, we should be like karma and discredit Daniel Ek using the truth. Daniel Ek’s recent statement about the musicians who spoke out is simply false, and that is the truth.",1,,/r/indieheads/comments/jihqru/musician_workers_union_launches_justice_at/geccheq/,"I have a campaign that I wrote about Spotify that pertains to this question.

It's a fantastic platform for hosting your services. They take a small cut of each job, but also ensure the client puts up the money before beginning, as well as ensuring that the client is happy before you get paid. They'll mediate in any issues that might arise.

The feedback system helps build your profile and once you've got a lot of good feedback on your page it's a great look for customers who are checking you out and considering your services.

That said, essentially all of my clients come from my own network, so I don't necessarily see SoundBetter as a market for prospective clients. Not to say that it can't be, but in my experience nearly everyone I work with is already familiar with my work as an artist and are coming to me with similar music.

To me, that's honestly how I want it to be because I much prefer working with clients who are already familiar with my sound. When you have random ""walk-ins"" they can often be untrusting, nervous about the process and there's pressure to prove your worth/skills. Also not necessarily a bad thing but in these cases it's good to establish boundaries about what you can and can't provide.

I had been signed up for their premium subscription a couple of years back but quickly realized the jobs board was made up of jobs that other engineers had rejected. I'd be interested to know if this has changed some now that they're connected with Spotify. Generally speaking, SoundBetter engineers will jump at the chance to do a job on there and usually if they have rejected it there is a good reason.

So, maybe things have changed but for me the SoundBetter premium experience meant multiple engineers all competing for jobs that were already in some way undesirable. I ended up cancelling premium but otherwise have been very happy with the platform overall and it's worth the commission they take out of each job.",14,,/r/mixingmastering/comments/jiz5sz/whats_your_experience_with_spotifys_soundbetter/ga9y99o/,"I'm getting close to 100 reviews on there now, and have been using it for mix / master jobs for a few years.

To me, that's honestly how I want it to be because I much prefer working with clients who are already familiar with my sound. When you have random ""walk-ins"" they can often be untrusting, nervous about the process and there's pressure to prove your worth/skills. Also not necessarily a bad thing but in these cases it's good to establish boundaries about what you can and can't provide. I had been signed up for their premium subscription a couple of years back but quickly realized the jobs board was made up of jobs that other engineers had rejected. I'd be interested to know if this has changed some now that they're connected with Spotify. Generally speaking, SoundBetter engineers will jump at the chance to do a job on there and usually if they have rejected it there is a good reason. So, maybe things have changed but for me the SoundBetter premium experience meant multiple engineers all competing for jobs that were already in some way undesirable. I ended up cancelling premium but otherwise have been very happy with the platform overall and it's worth the commission they take out of each job.","i'm getting close to 100 reviews on there now, and have been using it for mix / master jobs for a few years. it's a fantastic platform for hosting your services. they take a small cut of each job, but also ensure the client puts up the money before beginning, as well as ensuring that the client is happy before you get paid. they'll mediate in any issues that might arise. the feedback system helps build your profile and once you've got a lot of good feedback on your page it's a great look for customers who are checking you out and considering your services. that said, essentially all of my clients come from my own network, so i don't necessarily see soundbetter as a market for prospective clients. not to say that it can't be, but in my experience nearly everyone i work with is already familiar with my work as an artist and are coming to me with similar music. to me, that's honestly how i want it to be because i much prefer working with clients who are already familiar with my sound. when you have random ""walk-ins"" they can often be untrusting, nervous about the process and there's pressure to prove your worth/skills. also not necessarily a bad thing but in these cases it's good to establish boundaries about what you can and can't provide. i had been signed up for their premium subscription a couple of years back but quickly realized the jobs board was made up of jobs that other engineers had rejected. i'd be interested to know if this has changed some now that they're connected with spotify. generally speaking, soundbetter engineers will jump at the chance to do a job on there and usually if they have rejected it there is a good reason. so, maybe things have changed but for me the soundbetter premium experience meant multiple engineers all competing for jobs that were already in some way undesirable. i ended up cancelling premium but otherwise have been very happy with the platform overall and it's worth the commission they take out of each job.",354
ga9qgpl,1603805326.0,mixingmastering,TwiddleMeKnobs,"I've had an account since before Spotify acquired it, and to be honest, &lt;1% of my income over the past 10 years has come from SoundBetter. It's pretty much akin to SonicBids with a sort of ""pay to play"" option for engineers. If you're on the free version, you can't browse for jobs, so you just have to hope that someone will find you and pick you.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the kicker - in order to get the paid version, you have to have had several projects under your belt and a profile that is ""approved"" by one of their staff. So if you're just starting out, you're pretty much hosed.

I think the intent is to start a profile if you already have a decent list of clients, and you tell them all ""hey if you want to use me, just go through my soundBetter account"" and build up a profile that way, *then* you can get to the paid to actually ""unlock"" all of the extra money-making options.

Whether or not the paid version actually brings more money, I can't say, because I've yet to be let into the cool kids club.

In short, most probably not worth it unless you want to spend all your time just trying to drive people to your sound better account with the hope that eventually you can become a premium member.",2,,/r/mixingmastering/comments/jiz5sz/whats_your_experience_with_spotifys_soundbetter/ga9qgpl/,"I've had an account since before Spotify acquired it, and to be honest, <1% of my income over the past 10 years has come from SoundBetter.

I'm a jazz and classical musician so I love both of those dearly, but I also love and actively listen to Alternative rock, experimental rock, prog, bluegrass, metal, lo-fi, R&amp;B, hip-hop, folk, the list goes on... 

My favorite artists are the experimental ones I get to work hands-on with, but that's not to say I don't enjoy gigs where people just send me songs to mix or master or edit. I love helping with composition and instrumentation, I love experimenting with weird ideas even if they don't go anywhere in the end, I even record parts for them if they need.

Obviously with Covid it's a bit tricky doing these kinds of things in person but I have the capability of working remotely and hosting mix or mastering sessions remotely. 

I have a SoundBetter page if you want to check that out, but they only let me post one sample until I'm premium (I'm waiting on them for that) and you can find that page here: https://soundbetter.com/profiles/119831-graham-wolfe

Two WNY bands you can find on any streaming service where I've produced all of their work are Odd Waffle and Voyeur Motel. If you want more examples of my work feel free to DM me and I can link you to the piles of projects I've done that aren't released.

From a users perspective , I have used it several times and the process was really professional and as one would expect. The only problem with it is it is pretty difficult to search. There's soooo many providers on it (pages &amp; pages for each category) and it seems to put the most popular and ones with most reviews always at the top which is a bit frustrating. So it would be pretty rare for me to try and sift through to the less popular ones or ones just starting out unless I had a personal recommendation about them, or was specifically looking for them. So its probably better to somehow advertise yourself somewhere else, like your own website and provide links to soundbetter profile, as the chances of me finding a person starting out on it are very low, and I would not contact anyone thats new on it, unless they had great demo's and references somewhere.

Also some providers do not list their rates in the description and for some reason prefer to say ""contact me for pricing"" - I automatically skip those providers as I don't have time to upload my track and contact them with the whole brief &amp; wait for a reply (which can be days), only to find out they are way out of my budget. Also I never try and negotiate to ""get the price down"" so it is a far better practise to just be open about what your rate is in your bio - for a ""typical"" task and that would save both parties time, and you will only get serious enquires.

Also if anyone does contact you on it. Reply as soon as possible, as I have experienced some providers make no attempt to reply for days. I immediately pass on any provider that takes more than a day to reply.

g3peyse,1599046319.0,edmproduction,[deleted],"First of all your brand, there are a couple of deliverables you will need -

\- Logo: can easily cost around 1 to 2k depending on the agency  
\- A highly professional photo shoot for Instagram/Spotify/Promotional headshots. Getting a high profile photographer, his studio, props and lighting + a makeup artist can cost about 500-700 for about half a day of shooting.  
\- A basic website where you can showcase releases and link to your socials. Costs about 1k-2k depending on which agency youre going with and the features you want.  
\- If you have a specific vibe you are going for you can reinforce this by establishing brand guidelines: color schemes, fonts used, text tonality. You can then give whatever graphic designers you will be working with in the future (for album art etc) these guidelines to have everything be uniform. This could be part of the logo design but sometimes this will be a separate service. Can cost around 1k with a good agency.  


Those are one-offs, so make sure to spend time researching the best people for the job.

Then I would look into song production:

\- You can hire session musicians, including professional vocalists for your track. A good vocalist will cost around 300 per song on services such as soundbetter and vocalizr.  
\- Regardless of your production skill, you will want an actual mastering engineer to handle your master. These cost about 50-200 depending on the engineer.  


I would figure out what your best songs are and plan to release them in one-two month intervals. Each song release can contain the following:  


\- A professionally designed cover art. For Spotify/Soundcloud/Instagram. These can cost anywhere from 200-600. If you have brand style guidelines you can give these to your graphic designer.  
\- A lyric video or otherwise non-static video for youtube with cool visuals. Can cost anywhere between 300-800.  
\- If needed, good copywriting for your press release kits. Can cost about 100-200.  


Once you have the brand, the product, and the product deliverables you can look into promotion. There are agencies that can pick this up for you. Since you have the money I would outsource this as much as possible. You are already working a 9-5, you need to put as much time into making your music better as you can.

g3g7ad7,1598866178.0,mixingmastering,behindthecouchstudio,"Hi, 

even with a few past customer reviews and affordable prices, I never got a decent request on Soundbetter. At one time, I was applying for a pro account, where you can actively browse and search out the jobs on offer. That didn't work out, as there is apparently a waiting list so that there are not too many sharks in the tank, so to speak. After about 9 months I pulled back my request.

I heard on a podcast it might help to have had a few jobs on the platform to be accepted to the pro-level. That way, apparently, Soundbetter gauges you're turning over reliably... On the same podcast, the interviewed mixer/producer was very happy with their services - albeit, admitting it's not the be-all-end-all.  (IIRC, it was the 6-figure-homestudio podcast. Never mind the title, it's a cool podcast)

If I remember correctly, I myself had about 4 requests on Soundbetter over the years. The job descriptions were diffuse to lofty, mostly. Nothing materialised (partly because of me sniffing a pretty non-pro attitude). One might get luckier if you lower your standards just once or twice. If you have time to spend and too little business going on, it might be worth going that route.

g0gzgdc,1596651679.0,mixingmastering,atopix,"&gt; How do I know who’s actually legit, and has good equipment and skills?

Equipment doesn't really matter. There are big name engineers who are mixing on nothing but a computer and a pair of $100 headphones. Also, for $100 usd a mix, you are not going to find people in the range that have the cash flow to invest in fancy gear.

You could hire Yoad Nevo, who has all the gear you could ever want, but he charges $800 a mix.

So like I said, let's forget about the gear. Gear I think is only a good indicator when it comes to professional mastering, but you didn't bring that up, so let's move on.

&gt; I don’t have ears for mixing I guess, so I don’t think I’d be able to tell the quality level of these engineers through just listening.

Well, then how will you know if what you are getting is any good? It's one thing to not be a good mixer, but you are making music so you must have some kind of a decent ear for music at least.

But here is the main thing, which is what you are really asking for. Ideally you want a collaborator because mixing can have a big impact on what the music feels like after all is said and done. So you definitely want someone whom you think would be kind of on the same page with you.

That's obviously not always going to be easy to tell, but at the very least you want someone you kind of like. If someone is presenting themselves in a way that rubs you the wrong way, or not at all in your style, then pay attention to that.

I can tell you that *me*, as a mixer, I'm not the best fit for everyone and it has nothing to do with my ability to mix. We are people, we have different sensibilities and influences and affinities. This is music we are making, so being on the same page (or on the same book at least) matters.

Regarding soundbetter and Fiverr, I would avoid those platforms.

Vocals in the very beginning sound slightly off from the beats, though to others it'll sound fine. Pads could be heavier try layering them just a bit, more low end

The first breakdown, maybe add a quick rising subtle fx, sounds a bit quiet before it heads back into the vocals (at 1:18)

Vocals sound a bit quiet after 2 min because I believe you have more elements playing, whenever you have more elements playing make sure you leave head room where the main frequencies of the vocals are or turn them up a tad

I'd add an outro and intro unless you wanna keep this a radio edit, if you do just make sure you don't cut off the end.. let it fade until you hear nothing always ;) 

This is just me listening to them on $400 open eared sennheiser 600's however it's always good to test them on: Studio speakers, headphopnes, airpods, phone, and car before you send it off to get mixed/mastered or before you release. I have someone always professionally mix/master my tracks from soundbetter usually, and I test it on all 5 of those sources plus two other headphones (another studio headphone thats closed  and a shitty pair of headphones)

My final words of advice are if you can afford it, find a good mix/master engineer (trustworthy with good reviews) for a modest price. That'll be the difference maker because there's always gonna be people who can do it better than you or I can.

Hi! Though love comment from me. It’s coming from a good place!

Please do not use the vocals, it sets you up for all kinds of trouble. Here are some of them:

1. Labels will never sign a track that has vocals that are commonly used because of points below.
2. Fans will be disappointed if they will notice that the vocal is meaningless and used by everyone and anyone.
3. You can get a copyright strike on your own work, if some service, like Youtube ContentID decides that the vocal belongs to another artist.
4. Fans can be sent to the wrong artist if they Shazam your song.

I would rewrite the vocals and melody then hire a singer on Fiverr or Soundbetter. Much more fullfilling and it’s 100% your work. 

If you really don’t want to do that, then heavily modify the original vocals. So the melody is different, has radically different pitch or chopped up beyond recognition. 

TLDR;  Don’t use stock vocals because of copyright issues, write your own and hire a singer.",5,,/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/hvnw6y/will_my_song_be_disapproved_by_routenote_if_i_use/fyujt6l/,"TLDR below Hi!

fy9zkod,1594923395.0,mixingmastering,atopix,"Algorithm based mastering is just a glorified preset applied to your tracks, it's NOT a replacement for professional mastering.

As we always say, [mastering is all about a second opinion](https://www.reddit.com/r/mixingmastering/wiki/mastering). Especially in this era of bedroom production, mastering is the last chance to have a professional with trained ears in a controlled space and full range monitoring to listen EXACTLY what is going on with your mix.

If you can't afford professional mastering, maybe ask a friend or colleague to giving a try at mastering it themselves, in exchange for you mastering something of theirs when they need it.

Otherwise just finish your mixes, whatever you would do later to your own tracks in a ""mastering"" stage, you should always do it while you are mixing in your mix bus (or wherever you want because you have that option when mixing). That's why notions of self-mastering don't make any sense, because there is no reason to apply some processing later that you could instead have right there in your mix.

&gt; Human Mastering: - for $30 you can have a song mastered at Abbey Road.

Pretty sure their rates [start at £90](https://www.abbeyroad.com/online-mastering) ($113 usd). I'll PM you (and anyone interested) a list of professional mastering engineers with full range monitoring in a controlled room and some outboard gear, in a variety of price points (most of them below what Abbey Road charges).

&gt; there's also Fiverr; but is that a place to find a quality mastering engineer?

Let's stop giving money to Fiverr (and SoundBetter), they push people to charge scraps for their work in order to get some reviews. For less than $30 usd you'll only find amateurs without full range monitoring or any experience as dedicated mastering engineers. Nothing better than you could get from a friend or a colleague.

&gt; And for a low budget, do the Algorithmic services like Emastered do better than any human would do for a similar price?

They don't even do the same that any human would. A.I. can't understand the emotional content of your song. It's just a slightly customized preset. That's not mastering.

There's nothing that algorithm-based mastering does, that you should need. Definitely nothing worth paying for.

If you can't afford anything, don't know anybody who can take do some mastering for you, just finish your mixes yourself to the best of your ability. Maybe post them here when you think they are ready, to get some feedback.",3,,/r/mixingmastering/comments/hs8ksk/affordable_mastering_what_is_the_best_way_to_do_it/fy9zkod/,"Algorithm based mastering is just a glorified preset applied to your tracks, it's NOT a replacement for professional mastering.

* Automated, AI-based mix and master processes
* Voice-controlled DAWs (""Remove the mids from the snare channel"")
* New multi-track audio formats, which can then be mixed in real-time at the listener's end using an AI interpreter to optimise the music for the room/speakers/headphones of the listener.

There is no road map and no-one can tell you the right way to go about this as it all depends on your own personality and drive but I can share with you what I look for when choosing to hire a vocalist.

If I need a session singer in a hurry I look on sites that showcase singers/musicians that you can hire, there are quite a few out there but I have used  vocalizer or soundbetter or if I find their own website or their youtube channel. I never look on insta or any other social sites, but maybe thats just me, I simply don't have time. Next I listen to all their demo's and go through them until I find one that feels like it will fit our track, emotionally and in tonal range. I don't care about experience, such as if they are pro or just starting out. If their voice fits the bill, I contact them and hire them for a very quick smallish job, like backing vocals only. I assess how they are to communicate with, if they can understand instructions, are they prompt, basically if they act in a professional manner. Then I assess the material they send. Is it recorded well, is there technical problems with their ability to record, then how close to the brief did they stick to, did they ignore the instructions, did they follow them exactly, did they decide to go one step further and plus it and provide something extra I didn't even ask of them, then I assess how they take feedback, are they prepared to change their work, do they have ego problems and are unwilling to do revisions. How they perform with this small job will decide whether I come back to them with a job to do lead vocals.

I hope these just give you an insight to what goes through the mind of your future clients and will determine whether they will return to you with more work. There are tons of singers out there but so many of them fail in one or more aspects of the above, and it can take me a long time to find ones that tick all the boxes. I would rather choose a singer that's very professional  in attitude to work with over someone who's not,  even if their voice was not as good. Professionalism trumps vocal ability always for me. An artist can just keep getting better and better at their craft, but very few if any can improve their professionalism. 

To start with though try and make a simple basic website. Write some songs and demo's, even if the songs are not that great - you are not selling yourself as a songwriter but as a vocalist, so concentrate on that and have a demo showing your ranges, styles and ability. Keep making your own songs or do covers to sing to so you have a large enough body of work to distill down to a pleasing 4min demo.

I was instructed by their support staff to bring some of my outside clientele to hire me through soundbetter to up my standing in the ranking and listing order.

I decided I was better off focusing my energy on building my client base and leads out in the real world.  That being said i still get a gig on their from time to time. But nothing substantial.

frawyni,1590027963.0,mixingmastering,atopix,"Based on the site's [description](https://soundbetter.com/subscribe):

&gt; Premium providers go through a selective screening process. This assures the quality of work is high, which makes for happy clients who return and tell their friends. It also lowers competition for our Premium members which helps them close more jobs. Lastly, we accept new Premiums based demand for particular specialties, to maintain a balanced marketplace.

and especially:

&gt; We are looking for very experienced music production professionals who are great at what they do, are customer-service oriented, have a complete profile. We accept a small percentage of applicants based on these criteria, as well as marketplace need in particular categories.

The reason must be somewhere in there. They are selecting very few people whom they think will generate a satisfactory engagement with clients.

I've tinkered with Soundbetter a bit, and I'm very unimpressed. It's a less stinky Fiverr, but it has all the same problems: They force an environment in which to start getting your first gigs, you have to practically give away your work for free. And since that's the majority of the people using it, they drive the value of the services down.

I wouldn't bother with it. I have a profile, and I offer it as an option to my clients who may want an extra layer of guarantee in dealing with me (the vast majority don't). They have to cover all the fees that Soundbetter charges me though.

fq0ftqb,1589031207.0,audioengineering,daxproduck,"I use soundbetter as a side hustle and most of the work I do is editing vocals and then mixing them onto a stereo track that people have bought.  It’s definitely a market.  

Probably about 10% of that I would call “professional” stuff that is actually quite good and has a shot at success.  These people value my editing work and I’ve gotten quite good at mixing vocals onto a stereo mix.  If the instrumental has clearly already been mastered I ask for the premaster.  They usually have it.  

80% is definitely the “prosumer” kind of stuff that doesn’t sound great and the songs aren’t good, but it’s more of a hobby and I can deliver something that they’re super happy with.

Given that not everyone might be able to secure an apprenticeship gig, let alone have the means to sustain one for a few years (you get paid little) second best thing is to pay a pro to review your work and give feedback. 

After spending a lot of time recording, mixing, fixing, re-recording, and not going anywhere, I went to soundbetter and had a Grammy winning engineer mix my 8 song EP and it still sounded nothing like I had hoped for.

I’ve learned to just cut off communication as soon as people start lowballing.

Poor communicators with notes, unrealistic expectations, expecting me to do extra work for free.

ffyjc2h,1580347797.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,Dimitri-Czapkiewicz,"I do not working with any intermediaries; especially pay for companies. I have worked with some A-Listers in a different capacity than producer/artist. They are easy to get along with and if you work on a project it is usually a pleasure. It was always from someone who knew someone. I have always found a way to contact an A-Lister if I wanted to - and so can you - if you use your head and act professional. 

I just browsed the 'Soundbetter' website. They seem like a decent all in one agency for any of your needs. (Like and Angies list for music production) The verbatim reviews and and ratings is probably what you are paying for? The site says it costs $1800 to have a song recorded by an A-Lister (with owning all the rights/pay for hire). This is very low. This is what a competent engineer/producer who is starting out might charge - but far from Martin or West. I imagine I might qualify as an A-Lister to them and this would worry me. An A-List producer is one who is the top of the heap. They have used 1,000s of mics and preamps alone - and have put out numerous #1 hits. 

In the music industry you can not imagine how many people have worked with an artist/producer that had any kind of longevity. The list is in the 10s of thousands of people. But that does not make them A-Listers. This puts a red flag up for me personally. On the internet/social media if you contact a REAL good producer and say hey I have $2k to record my song - many would do it. In a fast turn around for hire job - you are taking all the risk and you will have to promote it. 

I was always much more interested in saying to an A-lister - here is a project what do you think. Would you like to get involved? (and of course correctly solicit if needed) HERE they are saying WHAT THEY think of the project - and know it is a labor of their love or the potential to make them money.

So here is my question: Do you have to pay this guy? If you do then that is what you get. That guy and he will do the work. It is not a bad deal if you really want to get to know or  try to get in a working relationship with THIS GUY on a one on one situation. This is worth the money alone. But it is a fair amount of money.

It depends on how you are defining ""career"" because there are a lot of very successful bands out there that still work 9-5 day jobs because their music income isn't enough to support themselves/their family.

fc1v6wg,1577330730.0,BudgetAudiophile,polypeptide147,"Alright cool. I've got something really good in mind for you then.


[U-Turn Orbit turntable](https://uturnaudio.com/products/orbit-basic-turntable). You need a preamp with it. You can get it without one for $180 or with one built in for $250. External ones usually soundbetter, but you're working with a moderately tight budget so you might want to go with one built in. If you want an external one though, [this one should be good](https://www.schiit.com/products/mani). If you get a different turntable down the road, you'll be able to keep the preamp and just swap out the tt, but if you go with a built in one and you decide to get a new tt, you've got to start over.

Now you've got about $250 for speakers and an amp. Personally, I'd go with passive speakers and an external amplifier, as would most people around here. It allows you to swap stuff out or upgrade if you need to.

My first recommendation for speakers was going to be the [PSB Alpha P3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MJVPSHJ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_1wcbEb24PC6TG) but unfortunately they went up in price. If you've got a bit of extra money though, they would be an awesome speaker to get. I absolutely love them.

The next logical speakers would be [the Micca RB42](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JC416LG/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_9xcbEbN4BXJXC). At $150 I really can't find anything that can beat them. Just all around solid performers. There are a few people on this sub that have done reviews, and every one is solid. Zeos also did a review of them on YouTube if you're interested, as did JoeNTell. They're stellar performers.

To power the speakers, you'll need an amp. The SMSL SA50 would be good, but I'm going to suggest you go with [the SMSL SA100](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q2VN7RL/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_pzcbEbNHZA294). For an extra few bucks you get Bluetooth, which could be nice if you want to listen to something besides vinyl on your setup.

-----------------------

I've got another good option for you as well. Same turntable, without the preamp, [and grab this amplifier](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078WFDR8D/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_oBcbEb4E6KD1N). It has the phono input in it already, as well as Bluetooth, and is just $100. This will give you a bit more to spend on the speakers, so you could definitely get those PSBs that I mentioned. It would also allow you to get [the Wharfedale Diamond 220](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OHIZQ50/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_EEcbEbF22ZTYY), which are great speakers. The PSB are very accurate speakers, while the Wharfedales are a bit warmer, meaning the bass is boosted a bit and they top end is smooth. They're just easy listeners.

I'll throw another pair of speakers out there just for fun. [KEF Q150](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071P6KQZX/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_i_3CcbEbYMRTXP2). At $300, these will put you over budget. However, they're normally $600 and they're half off right now, so if you can swing it and you want to, these will be a lot better than the other options in my opinion.

Just to toss this out there, I'll let you know what I would personally do. I'd go with that turntable and that Sony receiver that I linked. For speakers, I'd go with the PSB Alpha P3, unless you've got a large room and want them to get loud. Then I'd go with the Wharfedales.

I use services like soundbetter or airgigs and request/order the parts I want recorded with online session musicians. I'm assuming you're asking *in general* how distance would affect the creative process, but this might be useful to you as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Pros: 

* People treat this as a job (as it should be for professional musicians). There are no excuses on why someone cannot make it for a recording, no delays, no ''not in the mood'' now etc. 
* There is no disagreement on whether your bandmate likes the project you're working. If you like do not like working in teams, have a clear vision on what you want done and do not have a lot of time to work around different time-schedules, online session musicians are great.
* Did I mention time? You can work the piece you want recorded  on your own time, send it over for recording and start working on it again on your own time when it gets sent back. On your day off, while eating weetabix in your pyjamas.
* No studio fees!

Cons:

* Not every time you'll get the idea you have in mind executed they way you want it. Or even if you do, it doesn't mean it will be ideal. Biggest con of working remotely is that you cannot try lots and lots of different things on the same session and explore all possibilities of a track 
* Recording quality. 50% chance you'll end up with a ''not great'' recording. Drums for example, half of the times I've ordered a recording, I get clipped waveforms that are really hard to bring back to life.
* Not possible to work consistently with the same musicians. I have found a couple of good musicians in the past but had to go for other options recently as their profile has been inactive for quite a while now.

&amp;#x200B;

Again,  I'm assuming you're asking *in general* how distance would affect the creative process, but this might be useful to you as well as I have to admit, this works better than any other option for me.

Fiverr - if you don't want to spend the time searching and wading through gigs, you can create a Buyers Request with your requirements and budget. Sellers will bid on the gig. With that said, if I were a client looking to get music mixed and mastered, I'd be confident going with someone reasonably priced who appears in the top 10 or 20 search results. They're there for a reason, and are at the top of around 5k others.

Upwork and Freelancer - if you search freelancers on these, you'll generally pay more than if you place a gig up to receive proposals, where you'll get a wide range of bids.

Soundbetter - if you want to be sure you're getting a high-quality professional, this is the place to go as it's focused, specialised and they only let paying members who have gone through a screening process access the jobs board.

Overall, it's a great time to be an independent artist and send your tracks to an engineer online. There's a ton of choice and you don't have to break the bank.

Most of the best records have outside help at some point, even if it's just advice on what to do next. It's hard to figure everything out on one's lonesome :)

f14bcr7,1569172025.0,makinghiphop,heaven-_-,"&gt;**Is it better to record with FX on the raw recording?**

It makes more sense for you to record raw than to record with FX. When you record with FX, you must consider buffer lag and amount of FX you're gonna need. Usually, high-end professional studios have some kind of vocal chain FX like high pass EQ to cut out low frequencies, compressors. But if you're recording at your home, I recommend not using anything but a simple high-pass filter (especially if you're gonna send your project to an engineer).

&gt;**Should I mix myself, or pay someone or ...?**

I don't believe in ""let an artist be an artist, let a mixing engineer be an engineer"" thing. I think an artist should build up a connection with his engineer. Without a connection or leaving no notes of how you want the final product to sound, you'll probably be disappointed with the mix because you didn't explain your style and sound you want to achieve.

&gt;**Does anyone know where I can find talented engineers?**

I would love if you would check me out. I'm ready to work with you together on your music. Also, I don't mind lots of revisions because I care about the final product.

I make good money from fiverr but it took a few years to build up my profile and client base. There is also less competition in terms of the qualities of other engineer. 

I’ve gotten 2 projects from sound better in the couple of years I’ve had it. Lots of competition since there are some berg established engineers on there. 

Never gotten anything from Upwork but it’s mostly people looking for someone to edit podcast or do music for a film for next to no money. Sorry but I’m not doing your entire indie film for $50.

There is no shortcut to this. You gotta have a really good portfolio and spend the time slowly acquiring clients like anything else. It’s a grind just to make a decent living.

&amp;#x200B;

"" The problem is I don’t know what to do with the lyrics I write. How do I find a melody for the words?"" - Try out different melodies and find one you like. What you end up using will probably depend largely on the type of instrumentation you use to support it (aka the beat). 

&amp;#x200B;

"" How do I find someone to make a beat that fits my vision for the song?"" - Unless you want to pay for a quality producer to personally craft something specific for you, your best bet is to find producers online (YouTube is a really great resource) or try to produce your own. The latter, of course, isn't going to sound as polished (at least not at first) but it'll probably be more fun and will be beneficial in the long run. 

&amp;#x200B;

"" How do I find people to help me out with making it professional quality?"" - Recording engineers are the ones who can record you and your instrument(s) properly. Mix engineers are the ones who mix your song, which essentially means they take your rough tracks and turn them into a cohesive song with probably volume levels and audio treatment. Mastering engineers put a spitshine on the final mix that the mix engineer creates, making it sound a bit nicer, louder, and properly formatted for streaming services, CDs, etc. You can honestly handle the basics of recording yourself if you aren't doing anything super complex, so your priority here should be a decent mix engineer. Many times, mix engineers will also offer to master the track as well. Mastering is a different trade but a lot of mix engineers will be good enough at mastering for your purposes. 

&amp;#x200B;

"" Can I find writers to help me write lyrics and melodies?"" - Yes, you can. AirGigs, SoundBetter, Fivver, and Thumbtack are all great sites you can hire writers with. Keep in mind, anyone who is doing anything for you (writing, mixing, mastering, playing an instrument you don't, etc) is going to expect some sort of compensation. Occasionally, you can find someone brand new who just wants experience and will do something for free but the results won't be on the same level as you might imagine. 

&amp;#x200B;

"" How do I copyright it so I can put it on music platforms?"" - Honestly, don't worry about distribution until you have something to distribute. You're jumping the gun. 

&amp;#x200B;

""What else am I missing if I want to make a song and take it as far as I can go with it? How much does all this cost?"" - 'Take it as far as you can go' would involve marketing, which as with all these other costs, varies greatly. Start to finish, you can make a song for nothing (provided you have equipment and do it yourself) and just post the song in free spaces for a whopping total of $0.00. However, if you paid top musicians, producers, and writers to make a song, top engineers to record/mix/master it, and top marketing agencies to get the song out in the world, you could easily spend tens of thousands of dollars. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hope that helps! All in all, if you are just starting out, don't worry about marketing or hiring the best of the best or buying super expensive equipment. Just get the basics and start making music. The other stuff won't ever matter if you don't become great at your craft and put things out in the world.",2,,/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/c8dl91/what_are_the_steps_involved_in_making_a_complete/esmqsup/,"Congrats!

AirGigs, SoundBetter, Fivver, and Thumbtack are all great sites you can hire writers with. Keep in mind, anyone who is doing anything for you (writing, mixing, mastering, playing an instrument you don't, etc) is going to expect some sort of compensation. Occasionally, you can find someone brand new who just wants experience and will do something for free but the results won't be on the same level as you might imagine.  &x200B; "" How do I copyright it so I can put it on music platforms?"" - Honestly, don't worry about distribution until you have something to distribute. You're jumping the gun.  &x200B; ""What else am I missing if I want to make a song and take it as far as I can go with it? How much does all this cost?"" - 'Take it as far as you can go' would involve marketing, which as with all these other costs, varies greatly. Start to finish, you can make a song for nothing (provided you have equipment and do it yourself) and just post the song in free spaces for a whopping total of $0.00. However, if you paid top musicians, producers, and writers to make a song, top engineers to record/mix/master it, and top marketing agencies to get the song out in the world, you could easily spend tens of thousands of dollars.  &x200B; Hope that helps! All in all, if you are just starting out, don't worry about marketing or hiring the best of the best or buying super expensive equipment. Just get the basics and start making music. The other stuff won't ever matter if you don't become great at your craft and put things out in the world.","congrats! deciding to go for it is the first step.  &x200b; "" the problem is i don’t know what to do with the lyrics i write. how do i find a melody for the words?"" - try out different melodies and find one you like. what you end up using will probably depend largely on the type of instrumentation you use to support it (aka the beat).  &x200b; "" how do i find someone to make a beat that fits my vision for the song?"" - unless you want to pay for a quality producer to personally craft something specific for you, your best bet is to find producers online (youtube is a really great resource) or try to produce your own. the latter, of course, isn't going to sound as polished (at least not at first) but it'll probably be more fun and will be beneficial in the long run.  &x200b; "" how do i find people to help me out with making it professional quality?"" - recording engineers are the ones who can record you and your instrument(s) properly. mix engineers are the ones who mix your song, which essentially means they take your rough tracks and turn them into a cohesive song with probably volume levels and audio treatment. mastering engineers put a spitshine on the final mix that the mix engineer creates, making it sound a bit nicer, louder, and properly formatted for streaming services, cds, etc. you can honestly handle the basics of recording yourself if you aren't doing anything super complex, so your priority here should be a decent mix engineer. many times, mix engineers will also offer to master the track as well. mastering is a different trade but a lot of mix engineers will be good enough at mastering for your purposes.  &x200b; "" can i find writers to help me write lyrics and melodies?"" - yes, you can. airgigs, soundbetter, fivver, and thumbtack are all great sites you can hire writers with. keep in mind, anyone who is doing anything for you (writing, mixing, mastering, playing an instrument you don't, etc) is going to expect some sort of compensation. occasionally, you can find someone brand new who just wants experience and will do something for free but the results won't be on the same level as you might imagine.  &x200b; "" how do i copyright it so i can put it on music platforms?"" - honestly, don't worry about distribution until you have something to distribute. you're jumping the gun.  &x200b; ""what else am i missing if i want to make a song and take it as far as i can go with it? how much does all this cost?"" - 'take it as far as you can go' would involve marketing, which as with all these other costs, varies greatly. start to finish, you can make a song for nothing (provided you have equipment and do it yourself) and just post the song in free spaces for a whopping total of $0.00. however, if you paid top musicians, producers, and writers to make a song, top engineers to record/mix/master it, and top marketing agencies to get the song out in the world, you could easily spend tens of thousands of dollars.  &x200b; hope that helps! all in all, if you are just starting out, don't worry about marketing or hiring the best of the best or buying super expensive equipment. just get the basics and start making music. the other stuff won't ever matter if you don't become great at your craft and put things out in the world.",599

Title: **Paid a ""professional"" mixing/mastering engineer - He sucked ass. Do I have the rights for refund?**

Original Post: 

&gt; Yo!
&gt; 
&gt; So I got a song that I really wanted top notch quality on, so I went on [soundbetter.com](https://soundbetter.com). Found ""professional"" mixing/mastering engineers . Picked to most legit one IMO. I payed 50% ($220) in advance and apparently this mix/master was reaaaaaaally bad. Do anyone know if I have the rights for refund when someone does a service that doesn't meet the standards AT ALL(when I asked for a refund, he obviously said no)?  I asked soundbetter but they said that they don't interfere with the deals so no help there. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; Also FYI he never mentioned anything about refund policy in either his profile or when the deal was made. In case that makes any difference.

edcrv43,1546746013.0,edmproduction,Dudemanbro88,"To be honest, it all comes down to quantity and quality. If you're asking for a couple days worth of work, absolutely. Another thing to think about is that sometimes singers want royalties, though not all. 

If you break it down in to time to per hour for a professional, for $50-$100, you're looking at maybe around 2 hours of someone's time? Many can bang out a tune in that time frame, but that's if EVERYTHING else is in place. The melody, style, etc etc etc. They walk in, listen to it a few times, and then try to lay it down with as little revisions as possible. Sure this could be done in that 1-2 hour time frame (or a little faster), but everything must be mapped out perfectly. 

Another thing to think about is that finding the right one with the right gear is crucial, too, especially for remote work. Because if you have everything laid out for someone and they send you back a vocal recorded on an internal laptop mic, you'll spend more time in post fixing that than you ever wanted to (totally made example, but just using that for exaggeration effect). 

If your budget is truly around that much, one thing might be looking for vocalists near a university near you that has some talented vocalists but who aren't established yet and can't commanded some of the higher prices. 

Another thing to look at is a website called soundbetter. tons and tons of vocalists for hire there.

eab0wxw,1542991040.0,classicalmusic,sassykeys,"Fiverr and Upwork are two obvious ones to go through. However Fiverr is maybe only increasing its credibility now with the introduction of Fiverr pro. The name ""Fiverr"" is essentially advertising cheap services which isn't good. Upwork takes 20% commission from your first $500 from any client. You can factor that into your quotes but you might be playing price wars against some Indonesian which is a losing battle. On the other hand it's possible to find great clients through Upwork too, it's really a mixed bag. 

Airgigs and Soundbetter for music related work are definitely worth looking at. I've done some piano jobs through those sites and their commission rates are very reasonable. 

There's even r/forhire but don't expect anything from it, still though it's worth putting yourself out there.

You should be looking up who mixed songs that you think sound good and that you would like to sound like.  A lot mid-level indie bands' records are mixed by guys who don't charge more then $500 a song.  There have also been huge hits mixed on a pair of cans and a macbook in a bedroom.  Set your maximum budget and then find a guy/gal who's work you like and who fits in that budget.  

You mention Soundbetter.  Maybe my opinion is in the minority here, but the records you love are probably not mixed by the people on Soundbetter.  I would highly recommend finding the people who bands you listen to and enjoy are using.  In my experience those people are not on freelance websites like Soundbetter.  

Depending on where you live I would recommend looking up any studios you have in your area and checking out what they've done.  That way you can actually meet the person face to face and listen to your music in their studio.  Communication is a critical component to having your mixes come out the way you want them to.  Even the best mixer will disappoint if you don't share the same vision.  Actually meeting and discussing what your looking for and talking about music and records you like is invaluable.

e46lo7q,1534266677.0,mixingmastering,atopix,"Hey there, welcome to the sub. It's cool that you've been working with classical and contemporary musicians, it's a great way to learn about dynamic range.

The only track I thought had problems is the trap one. It's very dark in an unpleasant way, it seems as it has been low-passed and it's lacking some punch above 60hz. I recommend you try the test mentioned [in this article](https://www.reddit.com/r/mixingmastering/wiki/lowend) from our wiki. And that you learn more about how the low end on your setup translates to other systems.

But the rest sounds pretty good, you are definitely in the right track for just seven months of it.

Another thing: It doesn't make much sense to say that you mixed and mastered a track. If you did it all, then [it's all mixing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DekX3nq5fNE). [Mastering is about objectivity](https://www.reddit.com/r/mixingmastering/wiki/mastering) and as the person who spent hours and days mixing the material you are way too close to it to step back and analyze your mix for imperfections and opportunities (in the exact same listening environment in which you made it).
Anyone can put a limiter on the master bus and make a loud mix, but that's not what mastering is (or should be) about.

e2e7p23,1531602353.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,MoonSafarian,"I've used it for my last couple of projects, and I've had a pretty good experience. It truly does have people who are in the industry and work with big acts, and they use Soundbetter to fill the gaps between big projects. 

You've got two ways to go about it there:

1. Post a job for people to give you bids for. You'll receive bids from anywhere from probably $100 - $500 per song for mixing, $30-$200 for mastering. It'll depend on the person and their credits, and sometimes how much they like the music. My first experience there, I had a guy give me a bid which was reasonable, but when I expressed concern about working with someone on a different continent, he told me he really wanted to work on it and instantly lowered his price so I'd go with him. I don't know if that's how he truly felt, or if he was just really looking for work, but he ended up being great to work with and did a fantastic job on my EP.
2. The other way is to find specific people whose credits you like, and ask them to propose a quote. This'll probably take longer to get a bid, since I think the way it works is that when someone isn't busy, they bid on jobs people have posted, but it's less likely that a specific person has immediate availability. 

If you take the second route, I wouldn't necessarily tell you that you always get what you pay for, because someone might quote you in a way of saying, ""I don't want it, but for this price it's worth it to me.""

e1h6kn1,1530239399.0,edmproduction,[deleted],"Hello friend!

As someone who has spent a few years now working with both major label and independent clients as an assistant and top engineer, I think the best advice I can offer is to diversify your skillset as much as you can while still providing your strong set as the primary service you offer. I have many clients who formerly would pay me to mix their songs loop back around and pay me to record them, some artists who pay me to record them also pay for me to assist their setup and breakdown of their instrumental sessions, and take as many jobs as I can — so long as they pay my hourly rate (I think with a down payment is the best model for payment of independent producers, engineers and the like).

Additionally, try to expand your skills in electronic music into writing with songwriters in pop music. I know the Netherlands has been incredibly influential in this regard. There are so many borrowed elements in pop music which hail from electronic, and each of those elements are something which you probably already have the capabilities of replicating. 

SoundBetter is a good resource but can be annoying in terms of quality, idk, some people swear by it.

If all else fails, take some time trying out assistant work on records outside your genre. This market is diminishing, though.",2,,/r/edmproduction/comments/8upg8t/ghostproductions_and_how_to_sell_them/e1h6kn1/,"Hello friend!

dzeut1a,1527028092.0,mixingmastering,atopix,"Well, to begin with one of the purposes of this subreddit is to offer mixing or mastering services. If you are interested in posting here, [read the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/mixingmastering/wiki/rules) and go for it.

Other popular options these days are [SoundBetter](https://soundbetter.com/), a platform exclusively dedicated to professionals in the music industry and [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/), which is more of a general purpose freelancer marketplace.

Having said that, unless you are a little bit established and have a bit of a name, those platforms can be extremely competitive and it's not easy getting gigs there unless you charge next to nothing for your work.

In my experience, nothing beats approaching people yourself in a transparent/non-spammy way. Reddit is filled with communities of musicians, from people starting up to seasoned professionals, getting in touch with people whose music you like, showing them your mixes and telling them to keep you in mind for a project, can pay off. Approaching small indie labels and producers can also prove useful.

As far as DON'Ts go, the main one that comes to mind is: Don't do this mechanically. Don't write a generic message and copy/paste it to a bunch of people.

As you well observed, the field is indeed saturated. Anyone with a pair of semi-decent headphones, a DAW, and a couple of hours of YouTube tutorials on them, allows someone to call themselves a ""mixer"" (sometimes not even that much). So the key is to make yourself standout.

Some people think that standing out is having a website with a bunch of pictures of gear they don't have (ie: a huge analog console, top shelf monitoring, etc), pretending to be serious professionals, etc. I've seen hundreds of those sites and they are all the same.

I think you start standing out by being yourself. Are you a bit nerdy and geek out on tech? Are you into old school progressive rock? Do you obsess over dithering? Whatever it may be, letting that come across, makes you more you and less everyone else. It's not even a matter of a few people relating directly to it, but relating to you as someone who is passionate about what they like, about music, about mixing, etc.

One day, the producer I now work for came to the school I went to asking for a Pro Tools expert.  I was recommended.  I started out as the guy that gets the coffee, but I made it aware I had some pretty useful skills.  They let me do the vocal editing for the record we were working on, and everyone was impressed.  I had a paid gig.

I spent the next few years figuring out how to edit everything else as fast and as accurately as possible.  Along the way I got to learn how to engineer and mix with some pretty legendary people, and have gotten to engineer for some amazing artists.

But its definitely the editing that pays the bills.  It really sets me apart from what a lot of other engineers can provide.

Most of my work is for one producer, with the odd outside gig every now and then.

I also recently started using Soundbetter as a side hustle, and its been pretty great as well.

But I had 4-6 different ads going generally. They would advertise different skills and types of gig I offer, with a lot of overlap, but all distinct. I refined my ads over a year or two. I think it’s really important to understand who potential clients are, what they are trying to accomplish (often what they think they want and what they really want are different) and how the ad makes them feel. Spending money on your music is a leap for most people, and my ads inspire them to make that leap.

It’s important to note that my strategy only really works in major urban areas, especially ones that are also creative hubs. I think I could make a living working as I do in LA, NYC and Nashville. POSSIBLY Chicago or Austin. But probably not anywhere else in America. These are the places that have enough population, and a high enough proportion of aspiring musicians, to support my work.

I put ads on a few freelance websites when I was exploring client avenues. I got a handful of gigs through Soundbetter but haven't had anything in nearly a year. I got one tiny gig from Airgigs. Peopleperhour and Upwork are possibilities but I don't think I ever finished publishing ads there. I was hesitant to use fiverr. It doesn't exactly have a good reputation among us creative types. And they skim 20% of each transaction which is fucking outrageous. But unlike most freelance sites, they actually have a very active marketplace. Lots of clients. I published ads on fiverr, and at this point I actually make a good $500/month through it. I think I made $800 one month. I worked for almost nothing for a few gigs on fiverr to get established, and I put some work into perfecting my ads. Now I work on fiverr for about my typical rate, and if anybody lowballs me I ignore them. There seem to be some musicians on fiverr who are making a very good living by working the market to their advantage. Some of them I don't respect much, because they charge terribly low prices and probably do pretty cookie-cutter work over and over. Others charge reasonable prices and probably do pretty good work. If you don't live in a big music area, it's a great way to get experience working with clients, and can potentially be grown into something livable if you really want to. At this point it's a low-maintenance source of irregular and interesting little gigs for me.

Oh, I put up an ad on groupon and a listing on Yelp. A few people have contacted me that way and I think one or two gigs have panned out.

Overall, my strategy has been: Who needs the things I am offering? Where do they go looking for it? And then I maintain an appealing presence in those places, and eventually, the work starts flowing.

I have tried a few times to research and contact potential clients myself, but it's almost never panned out, and is not even close to being worth the effort.

I feel like soundbetter other sites like it are kind of a scam - you can list your studio or your services, but they have to approve you for higher-level rankings in search. Then if you are approved you have to pay a $350 fee for a premium listing. Plus in the seven years that I've been doing this professionally I've never talk to any musician who look for an engineer on Soundbetter, who wasn't already an audio engineer. 

Instead, I focus on going to shows and capturing clients there. I have an active Instagram and Facebook page where everyone else can find me. I run a small studio but I have about 1500 ft.² to play with, and if I have any needs for a larger studio I know where to go in town or I have a working relationship with a larger studio. 

The one thing I will say about marketing a studio that is absolutely important - never ever oversell yourself or your gear. 

Do not claim to have more experience than you have 
and do not plan to have more care than you have

Being honest and being an asset to the band is priority number one. 

Have a website that is updated and plugged into your social media accounts. 
Update your website every three months. Update your Facebook page every day to every three days. Update your Instagram every day. 

Consider the kind of people who make tutorials and never seem to have any real clients. It takes time and effort to build a business. Be patient with yourself. 

And the absolute number one best piece of advice I can give you for marketing a studio is

DONT MARKET YOUR STUDIO TO OTHER ENGINEERS.

But... I'm going to do all of the things you mentioned because they're great ideas. This project was a HUGE learning experience for me. I learned logic production, played all the instruments, wrote/re-wrote/tabled a lot songs and riffs along the way. I'd love to see how far it all goes.

It came out so much better than I thought it would, so I thought, fuck it, off to CDBaby to release it while I shop around sound libraries and try to find a professional to cover my songs.

Along the way I realized a couple of key things. First, 16 year old me, who loved playing guitar in his bedroom had it right. Play for the joy of it. Writing and recording all of this was an effort to please my own ears first. By the end, I figured if no one listens, I'll at least be proud of it and like it even in a few years. Second, I defined success before I worried about how well this would do. Success to me was the wife liking it, being able to listen to myself played back without cringing and getting ten people to like it. So as of this morning, I'm successful beyond my highest hopes.

It's great for you devs because you set a budget, explain the style, genre and work you need along with any other prerequisites and then people send you their portfolios and cover letters for you to check out.

Of course, because we're like vultures, there will be people who apply with their electronic EDM portfolio for your Medieval chess game, but you can also see on Upwork whether or not they have any past completed jobs and/or read reviews from other people they've worked with there.

Upwork takes a small commission but you can choose whether to pay that yourself or take it off the audio guy's payment. There are a couple other sites like Freelancer and SoundBetter too but I've found Upwork gets the most response and is the best deal for both sides (SoundBetter you're kind of at the mercy of however much we want to charge, even if we're not worth it).

The last thing I'd probably recommend is having a chat over Skype or Discord or something. People are so hungry to have their music in a game that they say they can do *any* genre. That should be a warning light. They will definitely have a preference over what they want (or can) do and nothing is worse than having a composer or sound designer working on your game that you spent hours, weeks, months and years on who doesn't even care about it or isn't suited to the style. Also be wary of free or very cheap stuff - you get what you pay for and people who don't value their own work are much less likely to value yours! If someone is offering orchestral music for $10 a track, their set-up probably has a lot of pirated software and it's probably very vanilla or forgettable in terms of quality.

- You do not need to pay to get benefit from SoundBetter.  It's free to create a profile at which point you can be found and invited to jobs by the tens of thousands of unique monthly visitors on SoundBetter.com looking for music production pros. 

- So far we've delivered over $2M worth of work to the pros on the platform.  We're pretty proud of that, and believe it's made a real difference in the lives of those who earned it.  Nearly all of that is from remote clients who found that provider on SoundBetter.

- Approximately half of that amount was to basic (non paying) members.

- The optional Premium membership is $39/month, and gives you extra visibility, as well as access to the job board. The job board is where musicians post their projects when they don't want to choose a specific provider but rather put out a request for proposal from our vetted Premium providers.

- The vast majority of Premium members feel the return on that investment is so good, that they tell their friends.  That's why we have several hundred applicants to the Premium program at any given moment, most of them having been referred by other Premium members.  

- We vet applicants to the Premium program and reject most, while activating those we approve only when we are sure we have enough work for them to get a great return on their investment. Every month we pull more and more jobs, and slowly let more and more Premiums into the program.  If we were interested in taking money from Pros without caring about giving them a 10x return, we would just approve all of those hundreds of applicants and charge them. We don't do that.  

- There are many Premium providers who have already made tens of thousands of dollars on SoundBetter, all from remote clients they would likely never have connected with otherwise.  Needless to say they are very happy.  If you want me to connect you with a few, send me a private message.  You can see on the site that there are pros with dozens of verified reviews.  Verified reviews are given only for jobs performed through SoundBetter.

- We are in this for the long haul.  We started SoundBetter with a mission to help freelance audio engineers and music production pros get remote work, while helping musicians get access to the best pros anywhere in the world.  My co-founder and I have invested every moment of our lives over the past three years for initially no, and then very humble pay, to try and build something great for the music production world.

I just made an assumption. Yes. But you made an even bigger one when you began with GB expecting to make a bounce right out of your DAW and into the genre din of your MP3 on the web. GB, Mixcraft, etc are Amature-Pro DAWS. Some offer you the sales pitch of simplicity over the convolution of BOTH the DAW companies forum boards (paid trolls) and the co.'s product- the DAW itself. Cakewalk just last January stole Mixcrafts payment plan and now we all have a COMPLETE PRO Daw for only $20 a month. Saves and EVERYTHING. But anyway, an acid-test for my logic would be to do a search of MODERN; CELEBRATED (not just YT hits) Mp3s that were made exclusively straight from the DAW and up onto soundcloud et al. But don't bother- they don't have them. What they have is a ""Started-in-the-AM-PRO-DAW-but-realized-it-was-necessary-to-buy-a-PROFESSIONAL-DAW-because-your-ears-don't f*****-lie"" Mp3 release story. Only the DAW company lies. Your ears and gut never lie. Prepare yourself for a deep and sophisticated product of the PRO DAW and its subsequent massive soak of your songwriting time on their boosey forums but stay with a PRO DAW from start to finish.

You seemed adamant on finding a location based job with your audio engineering degree. That isn't working. Have you ever though about freelancing your AE skills?

Lots of people need their songs mix/mastered. Sites like [Soundbetter](https://soundbetter.com/) are a hub for audio freelancers to do work for people who need songs mixed/master/produced.

I'd imagine you can build yourself up and start earning close, if not more income than you currently do at your pizza store. Except you'd actually be doing something you enjoy.
