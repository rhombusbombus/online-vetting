kqu3jpd,1708177198.0,mylittlepony,Comrades3,"But studying with the princess doesn‚Äôt make you an Alicorn either. 

Cadance was adopted as a niece after her ascension. 

And saving Equestria also isn‚Äôt key. The mane six have also saved it a dozen times.

The idea is an ascension necessary to save Equestria?

For example, Cadance needed her power over love to beat Chysalis and save the Crystal kingdom. She couldn‚Äôt do it as a normal Pegasus.

Twilight needed to have the authority (and destiny because that destiny is why Celestia takes her under her wing) that comes with being a princess to do what she does later.

Starlight probably won‚Äôt ever need to be a princess. She doesn‚Äôt have Twilight‚Äôs destiny of friendship from the moment she got her Cutie Mark. She also doesn‚Äôt have the destiny to restore a country like Cadance. She has so many powerful friends I can‚Äôt imagine the need for her to become an Alicorn.

If it does come down to who embodies friendship more, I feel the other elements would get it first. Truly, though, I think there will only ever be one princess of Friendship at a time.

So if there was a new princess, I imagine them filling a niche left behind, for example Luna retiring might mean a new princess of dreams.",1.0,1.0,/r/mylittlepony/comments/1asl7fw/does_anyone_else_think_starlight_glimmer_should/kqu3jpd/,"But studying with the princess doesn‚Äôt make you an Alicorn either.

kpjbwq4,1707424313.0,mylittlepony,Comrades3,"I have so many thoughts on the ponies in ‚Äúour town‚Äù

Cults take advantage of vulnerable people. While I am sure that some of the ponies in the town were like Trouble Shoes and got converted by the philosophy, most, especially all the named ponies other than Double Diamond, got hooked by the love bombing.

For example, I think Party Favors is like Cheese Sandwich, a traveling party pony who came to the town due to having a similar party sense as Cheese. He came to cheer them up but Starlight probably picked at the solitary nature of such a lifestyle. Add in the other ponies not laughing at him but smiling with each other, and he got brought in. It explains why he so badly misses his mark but is so easily influenced by the shunning house.

Night Glider I think was a forced conversion. I do think since she is excited about the mane six‚Äôs connection to Celestia, she used to be a guard who patrolled the night skies. The fact she stays in town after getting her mark though, proves she has nowhere else to go. She has a tough nature though so I think she was broken down by the shunning house after her mark was stolen but the love bombing before and after is what really brought her into line after working alone for so long.

Sugar Belle is interesting. We never see any family show up at her wedding. I believe she had a bad home life, choosing to run away. It says something how quick she is to marry Big Mac, and I think she really wants a ‚Äòproper family‚Äô and that is why she fell in with Starlight who pretended to care about her problems, and took advantage of all that. It‚Äôs clear it‚Äôs not the ideology that drew her in but the idea of ‚Äòfound family‚Äô that cults so often use to take advantage of people from bad homes.

Finally Double Diamond‚Äôs story seems pretty clear. As Starlight‚Äôs brute and henchman, there is no doubt he was fully on board. I think double Diamond was a worse version of Rainbow Dash. He pushed everyone in his life away as he competed to be the best skier. When he crashed with no one around to help, Starlight found him, nurtured him back to health, and had a captive audience to explain how his cutie mark ruined his life. Double Diamond was probably her most enthusiastic convert. He was grateful for the save, hurt, and lonely, probably realizing how lonely he made himself due to ‚Äòhis cutie mark‚Äô. He comes full circle, picking up the skis he crashed in and joining his friends to stop her.

I‚Äôm not even a fan of all these guys, but I do think whatever made them join a cult was pretty serious and Starlight took advantage of pre existing vulnerabilities.",1.0,1.0,/r/mylittlepony/comments/1alq1i9/whats_everyponys_favourite_ships/kpjbwq4/,"I have so many thoughts on the ponies in ‚Äúour town‚Äù Cults take advantage of vulnerable people.
