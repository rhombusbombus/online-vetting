kqldmas,1708032626.0,starcitizen,logicalChimp,"Perhaps not.

As an extreme example, currently a single server hosts the entirety of Stanton *plus* 100 players.

If CIG split Stanton into 5 sections - one per 'planetary group', and one for everything else - they could theoretically combine them into a single mesh, and set the player cap to 500... which would result in the same cost-per-player (5x servers, 500 players), as hosting five copies of the current setup (1x server, 100 players).

However, because each server in the mesh *isn't* running the entirety of Stanton, but only a single planetary cluster (or just the empty space between planetary clusters), even with 100 players the server performance should be significantly better.

Of course, this performance gain only lasts as long as players are evenly distributed across the mesh (100x players per server)... as soon as players start moving around, one or more servers will be overloaded - but the other servers in the mesh will see even better performance, etc.

Then, when we get Dynamic Server Meshing, CIG will be able to update the boundaries of those 5x servers, so that they each *always* handle ~100 players (and/or they each maintain a consistent CPU load, etc).

After all, I think if you took a current server, and removed 3x Landing Zones (which CIG keep saying are the most load-intensive parts of Stanton), we'd see significant performance gains even without a change in the player cap.",1.0,1.0,/r/starcitizen/comments/1arj1j0/inside_star_citizen_distribution_allocation/kqldmas/,"Perhaps not.

If you were in the outer edge of the system, and your world was rotated away from the closest star, the closer planet would have a brighter less severe winter and the further one out would wind up with a darker harsher winter.

Spring and fall would also be affected by this, summer could just suck.

I think fluidity and creativity in thinking is required for the forseeable future, for a human on planet earth.  To me, Northoff lends hope that we do indeed have the capacity to reintegrate with our environment using a powerful organic toolset.

Such behaviors have no surviving framework in which to apply themselves, so they must be expressed freestyle, with chaotic consequences.
