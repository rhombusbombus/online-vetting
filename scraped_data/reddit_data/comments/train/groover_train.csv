I'm one of the co-owner. I thought is was a good idea to give you a little lowdown on how our site works and of course it's also helpful for any other musicians who read this.  
**Musosoup works very differently from other platforms**  
**Quality Control**   
\- Unlike other platforms, we vet all musicians for quality control to Musosoup. Unless we feel they will connect with the 300+ curators using the Musosoup monthly, we simply don't let them in.  
**Costs**   
\- A campaign is £36 for 21 days, you can submit way in advance of your release to gain extra free campaign days. Eg: Submit a month in advance if your release and get a 51 day campaign for the same price.  
\- If you have no budget you'll still be able to apply for some free coverage in the marketplace and also accept free playlist adds and social shares from offers.  
\- If you have a budget you can extend your coverage in a pay-as-you-go method. This is explained below.   
\- **Each campaign garners normally around 30-70 playlist adds at no extra cost** than the campaign setup fee.   
**Offer System - Curators can approach you via what we call an offer.**  
\- Offers can have a contribution for creative time, marketing or hosting fees. We base the £ on a rough UK wage. For example, a blogger may ask for £5 contribution for 30mins worth of writing time. The average offer is £8, some are still free, or more depending on the time involved or reach. This gives a sustainable avenue for curators and an affordable PR model for artists  
\- If any cash is requested via an offer there is always a free option, 99% of the time these are playlists.  
**Musosoup's Marketplace**  
\- We also have a Marketplace which is a bit like the traditional model of artists applying like you may know on sites such as Submithub and Groover. Again ours is different, **you don't waste money via feedback** (feedback can be helpful sometimes).  
\- We have no feedback   
\- You can apply to curators but you don't waste any money if your music is not approved by the curator.

If you want to open Spotify and see a higher number next to your songs, then sure.

Fact is, you're paying regardless.

Getting on editorial playlists *is* possible but hard.

Getting playlists through Groover or Submit hub costs you, you just pay the service rather than the actual curator.

When you pay to get on a direct list one of two things usually happens. They either put you on a bot list or they drop you in a playlist that's already popular that may or may not have anything to do with your music.

I have a friend who used a pay service…I forget the name.

Anyway, they put him on a playlist that got him 15000 streams. But the actual playlist was all Elvis and Buddy Holly music … he's a Tame Impala type of musician BTW.

So basically he's on a popular playlist and for the people who were too lazy to change the song he got a play... 

BUT he *did* also get 10% of those people to follow him and add his song to their playlists. 

Is that worth it? 

Depends on you...

If you're seriously trying to make a career out of music. 

There's one way. 

Hard ass fucking work.

 You gotta grind socials every day, grind playing live and grind outputting good content on the regular.

Even then it will likely never pay you anything that you couldn't have gotten working anywhere else doing anything at all.

kp09wff,1707128296.0,musicians,RobotMonsterGore,"Small beans EDM artist here. I've released music with and without small and medium-sized labels. Other than prestige and bragging rights, I just don't see the point of signing anymore. 

Things in the music world have turned almost completely upside down from the pre-internet era. Today artists can record, engineer, produce, master, decorate, distribute, and promote their own work (and reach millions of listeners) without ever getting out of bed. The best you could hope for in 1990 was a used 4-track to make a shitty demo to shop around while playing to empty coffee shops and dive bars in hopes of getting noticed. Aside from a few scattered punk-ish collectives, there wasn't anything even *remotely* like social media at the time. 

And back in the day big artists got hosed left and right. I just saw some mess about how the wildly successful 90s R&amp;B group TLC sold millions of albums and toured for sold-out stadiums and took home something like $35k a year each. (Yes, that's like $70k in 2024 money, but still. What the actual *duck*.) 

So fuck it, do it yourself. No, it's not cheap. Yes, it's a huge amount of work. No, you're probably not going to see a lot of money unless you tour and move some serious merch. But my god you can reach *masses* of listeners in a matter of months without ever dealing with a label. I got playlisted via services like SubmitHub and Groover and purchased one (one!) cheap advertising package on TikTok and saw my numbers go from low double digits to well over 1,000 in a matter of weeks. That's almost two orders of magnitude. That's *insane*. And all this was *after* the same music was released by a reasonably strong label in my genre. The release itself did very little to boost the signal. All the heavy lifting fell to me. I've got more new music ready to go. You'd better *believe* I'm skipping the labels this time around. 

(Quick tip: Never spend money on music promotion services that approach you. Always approach *them*, and only deal with reputable names. Way too many con artists out there.) 

OH. And I heard some vague tea about one of the labels that I'm working with from a playlist curator via SubmitHub. Something about ""we usually don't showcase songs from label X, but we like your song, so congrats."" I was all like, why, what's wrong with my label? They alluded to some shady behavior but refused to say more. My imagination's running wild, so fuck *that*. 

So yeah. Stay independent. Don't sign. We live in a weirdly golden age of independent artists. It's still a crap shoot (your music has to resonate, you have to find your niche, you have to be a savvy promoter, etc), but the stars can align *so* much easier now than ever before. 

One last word of caution: social media sugar highs come at a cost. You still have to pump out quality music on a regular basis, and it might take months or years to resonate. You might have a viral moment, but those come and go quickly. Play the long game. Keep your head down and get back in the studio.

kj7r8jv,1706028147.0,musicians,a_scared_bear,"Congrats on getting where you are in a year! That's really impressive. A few ideas for things to look into doing next below. Also, just to put it out there, being an original music outfit these days is insanely hard, and there's so much more to it than just playing music. Seems like you've already got your shit together a bit, but if you're serious about this, be prepared for a lot of work on things that seems pretty stupid and unrelated to music at all, like replying to every comment on your first 100 tiktoks or whatever. That's just a part of the game these days.

\-Like everyone is saying, get on TikTok. It's the only platform with an algorithm that actually puts new content in front of users—most other platforms require your content to already have shown engagement potential before they'll field it to new viewers—which is why it seems like all the new viral artists are from TikTok. That said, this is ABSOLUTELY NOT a sure-fire way to go viral—it's more possible on TikTok than other platforms, but it's still incredibly unlikely, and everyone who thinks it's anywhere close to a sure thing is being influenced by the survivorship bias of only seeing the 1/1000000 success stories. So, like, you should do it, but don't get discouraged if you don't go viral quickly.

\-Sub-point: on TikTok, do as many trends as you can. There's no way to ensure a viral video, but if you use a trend that everyone else is already looking at or do an open-verse challenge with a successful artist, it's more likely. 

\-If your music is not on Spotify, get it on there (as well as the other DSPs, but mainly spotify), and if you have any resources at your disposal, use services to promote your music to appropriate independent Spotify curators. Look for platforms that pitch you to independent curators (Groover is the big one of which I'm aware, but there are lots of little genre-specific ones that come and go all the time). You do NOT want the services that allow you to buy streams—Spotify has been getting way more hardcore about docking streams and even kicking artists off of the platform for bot streams. Independent playlist promotion is higher cost per stream and no guaranteed stream count, but it's higher-quality engagement. 

\-A note on stats: spotify sucks, yeah, but if you want to break into the music industry, spotify stream numbers and tiktok followers are the two most important numbers out there. Many industry folks look at these numbers before they even listen to your music. Depressing and frustrating, yeah. But, that's the way it is—if you love and believe in your music, which it seems like you do, these are just a part of the process. 

\-I don't know what the deal with New Zealand booking agencies is, but here in the US, there's sort of a rule that, if you're able to sell out small rooms in 3 separate markets (like, 100 cap), that's when agents will start looking at you. It's very much not hard-and-fast, but that's definitely a turning point. If your band isn't there yet, keep looking for show opportunities in new markets to build and prove those accolades. If you are there, consider emailing a few independent agencies contact-us pages; I wouldn't necessarily ask that they take you on, but if you ask them for advice on how to make yourselves marketable to an agency, well, everyone loves being asked for their expertise. At best, they'll take a look and consider taking you in; at minimum, they'll give you tips for how to be more marketable; and at worst, they won't respond, and you'll have sent one useless email.

\-Try to get to know the pillars of the music scene in whatever your city is. There are probably more opportunities here than you realize. If you get to know the local non-for-profit radio program director, he'll probably do an album release segment for you on the air; if you get to know the promoter for the city's 1000 cap club, next time a national touring act comes through and needs local direct support, you might be the person they call. It takes a while to build those relationships, but they're good to have. 

\-If you've got some resources, consider pooling them and going in for a 3-6 month campaign with a publicist. There are a lot of price ranges for publicity out there; I'd recommend looking for someone in the 500-2000/month range, and only go with a publicist who you meet with and get along well with, and who you can find good recommendations for. It's very much about finding the right person for you and your band; I would recommend against someone who just takes the check and opens their roledex. You want someone who you like personally and who seems to geniunely like your music. There are so many opportunities that you don't even know exist that a publicist can connect you with—online blogs with a few hundred followers, weird special-interest festivals that want to associate themselves with new bands to seem hip, industry showcase concert series, connections with other sides of the music industry like synch licensing, etc. A few notes, though:

1: Publicists are expensive, and some of them suck. Only do this if you have the money and find the right person.

2: Many higher-end publicists might not take you seriously unless you have a manager. If you have one, great. If not, you can look for one. Even more so than with a publicist, finding a manager is about finding the right person; this is the person who is your liaison with the music industry, who's supposed to be fighting for your interests with every one of the other parties you work with. It doesn't necessarily need to be someone from a management agency; it can just be someone who you trust, who believes in your music, and who has a good work ethic. Learning on the job is a must for the music industry anyway, since it changes so quickly.

3: Publicists are somewhat limited by what you're doing during the campaign. If you decide to pay the big bucks for a publicist, try to line up the time period of the campaign with some big shows, and a few single and video releases, and an album, and a label contract signing, and etc etc. The more you do, the more they can do for you.

Best wishes for you and the other double jumps.","congrats on getting where you are in a year! that's really impressive. a few ideas for things to look into doing next below. also, just to put it out there, being an original music outfit these days is insanely hard, and there's so much more to it than just playing music. seems like you've already got your shit together a bit, but if you're serious about this, be prepared for a lot of work on things that seems pretty stupid and unrelated to music at all, like replying to every comment on your first 100 tiktoks or whatever. that's just a part of the game these days. \-like everyone is saying, get on tiktok. it's the only platform with an algorithm that actually puts new content in front of users—most other platforms require your content to already have shown engagement potential before they'll field it to new viewers—which is why it seems like all the new viral artists are from tiktok. that said, this is absolutely not a sure-fire way to go viral—it's more possible on tiktok than other platforms, but it's still incredibly unlikely, and everyone who thinks it's anywhere close to a sure thing is being influenced by the survivorship bias of only seeing the 1/1000000 success stories. so, like, you should do it, but don't get discouraged if you don't go viral quickly. \-sub-point on tiktok, do as many trends as you can. there's no way to ensure a viral video, but if you use a trend that everyone else is already looking at or do an open-verse challenge with a successful artist, it's more likely.  \-if your music is not on spotify, get it on there (as well as the other dsps, but mainly spotify), and if you have any resources at your disposal, use services to promote your music to appropriate independent spotify curators. look for platforms that pitch you to independent curators (groover is the big one of which i'm aware, but there are lots of little genre-specific ones that come and go all the time). you do not want the services that allow you to buy streams—spotify has been getting way more hardcore about docking streams and even kicking artists off of the platform for bot streams. independent playlist promotion is higher cost per stream and no guaranteed stream count, but it's higher-quality engagement.  \-a note on stats spotify sucks, yeah, but if you want to break into the music industry, spotify stream numbers and tiktok followers are the two most important numbers out there. many industry folks look at these numbers before they even listen to your music. depressing and frustrating, yeah. but, that's the way it is—if you love and believe in your music, which it seems like you do, these are just a part of the process.  \-i don't know what the deal with new zealand booking agencies is, but here in the us, there's sort of a rule that, if you're able to sell out small rooms in 3 separate markets (like, 100 cap), that's when agents will start looking at you. it's very much not hard-and-fast, but that's definitely a turning point. if your band isn't there yet, keep looking for show opportunities in new markets to build and prove those accolades. if you are there, consider emailing a few independent agencies contact-us pages; i wouldn't necessarily ask that they take you on, but if you ask them for advice on how to make yourselves marketable to an agency, well, everyone loves being asked for their expertise. at best, they'll take a look and consider taking you in; at minimum, they'll give you tips for how to be more marketable; and at worst, they won't respond, and you'll have sent one useless email. \-try to get to know the pillars of the music scene in whatever your city is. there are probably more opportunities here than you realize. if you get to know the local non-for-profit radio program director, he'll probably do an album release segment for you on the air; if you get to know the promoter for the city's 1000 cap club, next time a national touring act comes through and needs local direct support, you might be the person they call. it takes a while to build those relationships, but they're good to have.  \-if you've got some resources, consider pooling them and going in for a 3-6 month campaign with a publicist. there are a lot of price ranges for publicity out there; i'd recommend looking for someone in the 500-2000/month range, and only go with a publicist who you meet with and get along well with, and who you can find good recommendations for. it's very much about finding the right person for you and your band; i would recommend against someone who just takes the check and opens their roledex. you want someone who you like personally and who seems to geniunely like your music. there are so many opportunities that you don't even know exist that a publicist can connect you with—online blogs with a few hundred followers, weird special-interest festivals that want to associate themselves with new bands to seem hip, industry showcase concert series, connections with other sides of the music industry like synch licensing, etc. a few notes, though 1 publicists are expensive, and some of them suck. only do this if you have the money and find the right person. 2 many higher-end publicists might not take you seriously unless you have a manager. if you have one, great. if not, you can look for one. even more so than with a publicist, finding a manager is about finding the right person; this is the person who is your liaison with the music industry, who's supposed to be fighting for your interests with every one of the other parties you work with. it doesn't necessarily need to be someone from a management agency; it can just be someone who you trust, who believes in your music, and who has a good work ethic. learning on the job is a must for the music industry anyway, since it changes so quickly. 3 publicists are somewhat limited by what you're doing during the campaign. if you decide to pay the big bucks for a publicist, try to line up the time period of the campaign with some big shows, and a few single and video releases, and an album, and a label contract signing, and etc etc. the more you do, the more they can do for you. good luck! best wishes for you and the other double jumps.",1100,True,False

&amp;#x200B;

\- **dynamic instead of static tags:** this is the biggest gamechanger for me. i like being able to live-search with multiple tags while playing a set, cuz with one ctrl+f i can pull a decent set crate on the fly. like if i type in `#Mid #00s #Hit #HipH #Groo` i'll get a tagged list of only pre-peak songs, tagged for a 00s party (and not just made between 2000-2009), that were charting/club hits, in the hip hop genre, that i've categorized as groovers vs grinders or party tracks. i used to do that ALL by hand, sorting the various columns i dedicated to each and batch editing in serato (b/c every other tagging editor i tried would eventually break grid/loop/cue data) lexicon lets me add tags to multiple categories at once without worrying about overwriting, rename or re-order them whenever i want, allows more categories than there are columns in serato... it's just WILDLY more versatile for indexing. and tags can be written back to the tracks however you want to map it for use in a set, just how i like it.

\- **better playlist management:** more comprehensive smartlists with way more options (including filtering based on presence in other playlists, which was a huge gap when i moved from (then) itunes to serato for management. multi-selecting playlists to move or delete

\- **music discovery/purchase:** you can import spotify playlists and have it automatically search against your library to see what is already there. you can add a playlist and automatically search which music stores have it and the cost of each. you can create discovery playlists from music in your library, compare/merge playlists, and more. it makes parts of discovery and prep that took hours take minutes (and a coffee break since store search can understandably take a while)

\- **the phucking PHONE APP:** i have considered switching to rekordbox just so i could listen to and prep my dj music on the go. the app is in beta and still has quirks but already has let me speed through a thousand or so songs of rating/tagging on the go in less than a week. i don't know that i'd use it to set/name my cues and loops since the desktop app is better for that, but it's the perfect interface for star/energy/etc rating and tagging and i think actually better than the desktop app for those tasks.

kfo4sh3,1704005723.0,makinghiphop,HoodRawlz,"I have a love hate relationship with Groover but in the last 3 weeks I have been getting sync placement interest. An offer from a label over seas to press 3 of my singles to wax and a collab. Still waiting for deets on the placements (holidays). I have been placed in over 400 playlists this year. I figure if those placements pay off then Groover is a good start for sure. BUT your music has got to be decent and when I say decent I mean good AND consistent!!!!! There's no sugar coating it.

I can tell you exactly how I did it, although this is obviously subjective personal experience.

1. The song is good and people want to listen to it multiple times. This is not necessarily true for my older music.
2. I used Groover and Submithub and was accepted by quite a few playlists who then added me, some with over 19,000 followers
3. I shared my song in a few Facebook groups for fans of bands that I was inspired by. I explained my situation (totally solo project recorded in a laundry room) and I think that helped pique some interest. I shared in about 4 groups and averaged about 20 likes per group.
4. Once all that had begun, I shared to friends and family via social media as well as one Reddit post (which honestly didn't do great numbers)
5. Finally, after all of this unique global engagement, Spotify Release Radar picked the song up, which has since resulted in 2,400 streams.

For me, the key was brute force early on combined with confidence in the song. Looking at the numbers, my track has obviously been carried by Release Radar, but I think all of my groundwork is what got me there in the first place.

Only thing I can add that you may not know about is playlisting.

There are sits online like submithub and groover that you can upload your song and if selected you'll get put in a playlist.

I get anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand streams from that. You're not going to set the world on fire but for me, it's better than it just sitting there.

This will cost you though, the average rate is like $1 a credit on these sites and each submission is anywhere from 1-4 credits... and they don't have to accept you so if you're music isn't really there yet quality wise don't waste your time.

At the end of the day I think you have to learn to love the process and get enjoyment from that because the visibility thing is a whole other skill set.

Problem for me is that I hate it and, as you said, it's over saturated so do I really want to be doing something I hate that could result in me building an audience doing something I don't want to do.

k9efsw3,1700077792.0,musicproduction,marklonesome,"To get people to listen to your music you have three choices.

1. Grind social media. Post every single day to TikTok or YT shorts. Content has to be something people want to watch that just happens to have your music in it.  If it's just you playing your songs it will die. I mean, you might get 1000 views but that's not going to translate into anything meaningful on spotify. Do this everyday.
2. Play live. Grind this till you get to the point where you can get shows where people actually care to see you and the audience isn't already filled with your family and friends.
3. Playlisting. You basically pitch your songs to playlists and hope they get placed. You can do that on submit hub or groover (there's probably more)

What I did was, when you upload your song on distrokid (if you do it long enough in advance) you can pitch to spotify playlists.

You won't always get on, but when you do it's almost a guaranteed couple thousand streams with saves and adds to their playlists. That will in turn result in a about 10% of that audience listening to your other tracks. So if one of my song gets 2000 streams I usually see about 200 or 300 on the other songs off the EP.

I got one song added and then without even trying it was added to a bunch of other playlists that get streams. It had a bunch of streams until I got booted off that list. Now it gets a few hundred streams a week from other smaller lists that added it. I did nothing but pitch it when it was released.

Distrokid also offers a place where you can search for playlists to pitch too.

I release about three songs a month and pitch one out of the 3 of them. I'd say one every other month makes it somewhere.

With that said, you have to have music that is STRAIGHT down the middle.

Russian Alt Folk Metal with hip hop roots isn't going to have many playlist opportunities, though the ONE playlist for that shit is going to LOVE YOU.

I produce a few different styles but they're all pretty easily categorized in their genre.  

I also write for that. I don't make long songs, long intros...but that's what I'm into and I like to listen to.

With that, absolutely NONE of this is going to get you anywhere.

The conversion from TikTok or YT follower to Apple Music or Spotify subs is abysmal...like 1%. You'd need a ton of video followers to translate to anything meaningful on spotify especially since they're requiring 1000 streams to pay out anything.

k5mpe4w,1697765486.0,musicmarketing,count_zackula,"I would say it depends what genre you’re releasing with - the editorial staff at DSPs like Apple and Spotify have changed drastically in the past year. Of course, it helps to have a label backing you (even small indie ones), as they often have connects at these DSPs and can get your song to the right ear. This is particularly how you see artists with little to no audience and nothing released get their first releases on editorials. 

That being said, I know people who’ve gotten placements on official playlists with self-released tracks just by pitching through Spotify for Artists (no equivalent for Apple yet). I can tell you with complete certainty that your profile on Spotify doesn’t matter all that much - the quality of your pictures, what you write in your bio, pretty much irrelevant. 

Your music counts. Make it good and release it as consistently as you can. When you’re pitching, give a good description of the track, say where you’re based, and feel free to suggest a couple of fitting playlists. 

Spotify used to be more of a level playing field. I remember when you could contact curators directly through google forms. Unfortunately not the case anymore, due both to over-saturation and a lot of major label involvement with DSPs. Not to mention them blindly favouring whatever is going viral on TikTok and Insta right now. 

Don’t sleep on indie playlists and blogs. I would not recommend sites like PlaylistPush or Groover (as someone who’s been a curator). Just not a fan, and seems pretty low value. Submithub works and is my favourite of these types of sites. Again, make sure your description and profile is up to date, and submit to the right places - blogs included. Write ups (and sites like Hype Machine) used to be more important, but they still hold some value. 

Best of luck, don’t stop what you’re doing just because of a lack of attention from Spotify and the like. This industry isn’t easy and thrives on personal connections. But it’s really about the music, don’t forget that.

I’ve been placed in countless editorials over the years and have worked with (and at) many indie labels.","i would say it depends what genre you’re releasing with - the editorial staff at dsps like apple and spotify have changed drastically in the past year. of course, it helps to have a label backing you (even small indie ones), as they often have connects at these dsps and can get your song to the right ear. this is particularly how you see artists with little to no audience and nothing released get their first releases on editorials.  that being said, i know people who’ve gotten placements on official playlists with self-released tracks just by pitching through spotify for artists (no equivalent for apple yet). i can tell you with complete certainty that your profile on spotify doesn’t matter all that much - the quality of your pictures, what you write in your bio, pretty much irrelevant.  your music counts. make it good and release it as consistently as you can. when you’re pitching, give a good description of the track, say where you’re based, and feel free to suggest a couple of fitting playlists.  spotify used to be more of a level playing field. i remember when you could contact curators directly through google forms. unfortunately not the case anymore, due both to over-saturation and a lot of major label involvement with dsps. not to mention them blindly favouring whatever is going viral on tiktok and insta right now.  don’t sleep on indie playlists and blogs. i would not recommend sites like playlistpush or groover (as someone who’s been a curator). just not a fan, and seems pretty low value. submithub works and is my favourite of these types of sites. again, make sure your description and profile is up to date, and submit to the right places - blogs included. write ups (and sites like hype machine) used to be more important, but they still hold some value.  best of luck, don’t stop what you’re doing just because of a lack of attention from spotify and the like. this industry isn’t easy and thrives on personal connections. but it’s really about the music, don’t forget that.  hope that was of some help! source i’m an independent artist with about 500k monthly listeners on spotify currently and over 40 million streams to my name. i’ve been placed in countless editorials over the years and have worked with (and at) many indie labels.",394,False,False

k2uv0dx,1696078159.0,musicmarketing,Fun-Signal1556,"This response was absolutely insane... track was produced and mixed by an award-winning producer/engineer.

I listened to this person's music after and objectively, it's absolute trash.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;First of all let me tell you that I loved your track!!  
It is way above the average quality of tracks i receive here on Groover, it belongs to that fab 10% of fab songs I receive!   
The song is pretty strong (not an hit or even a single, but solid nonetheless), your voice sounds really good (maybe a little forced in the performance at times, but its tone cuts through perfectly), the only doubts i have are regarding the production and the mix.  
The song is produced pretty well, but it seems to suffer of a certain flatness, for example when the chorus kicks in we do not get that dynamic push that we would get if, say  Chris Lord Alge had mixed it, the track kind of stays there in terms of power, and the chorus (although well written melodically) does not really happen as much as it in my opinion should. It could be a production issue, a mixing issue and/or a mastering issue - who knows, but it is certainly an issue that should have been solved before releasing the track, in my opinion.   
Also, the song seems to be a little to lightweight, a lot of high frequencies and not enough low frequency power, which makes to my ears the track a little weak, when it should be powerful and engaging.  
Another issue I’d like to mention is that the arrangement seems pretty busy (especially percussion/cymbals wise) in the area where the voice is frequency-wise, and while we can hear the voice really well, this issue brings in a certain ear-fatigue, and the song becomes a little tiring to listen to after a while, since there are too many elements craving for attention.   
So what I’d recommend here is to use an external experienced and very creative producer/mixer to help out in the future, or - if you do not want or cannot do that - to really really do anything possible to improve the strength of the production. The best way to do this is to CONSTANTLY reference the track you are working on with a track in the same genre that is successful and that you love (something by NIN, perhaps?), to check if your track has the same level of quality. Sorry if I am stating the obvious but only a ruthless and - i will repeat it - constant A/B comparison can improve one’s production and mixing efforts, and I believe this is something that you definitely should do. Also, it will be fun, hearing our productions improving in quality it is a great feeling! It takes time and effort, but the spiritual/personal rewards are immense if we love music.  
I am sorry if my feedback - which, please let me state this again, is purely my personal opinion!! - is not 100% positive, even though, as i said, I loved the track!! But I hope what i wrote will prove constructive, and that it will help you forge a path that will lead you to create even stronger tracks!!",1,1.0,/r/musicmarketing/comments/16vlazy/the_truth_about_groover/k2uv0dx/,"This response was absolutely insane... track was produced and mixed by an award-winning producer/engineer.

k2rsa3l,1696018508.0,musicmarketing,PoliticalLove,"Hey, 

I think on the one hand you are absolutely right that there are many curators on groover who just want to skim the money for a short review of your song. You can often tell by the copy/paste responses you get, which contain some generalities about your song and a refusal based on taste. 

You can also see it in the numbers. There are curators who add less than 4% of submissions to their playlists and probably from people who have known them for a while.   
I think the problem is that you may want to be on too big playlists, because I think that the curators of these playlists make money mainly by accepting completely different submissions (from services that charge much more money and pay out to the curators). For them groover is a nice side income, but nothing more.   


I have made the experience that if you target medium playlists (up to 10 000 followers), you get quite good results. This way I got share rate of about 25% at groover. But, of course, they usually don't have a big impact on your streaming numbers (maybe 100 streams over time) and then you have to decide if it's worth it to you. 

What I find absolutely annoying about groover is that there are always people there who very enthusiastically promise to share your song and it just doesn't happen and the support at groover recommends you just write to the curators again. So by now I have 7 promises on my list that will probably never be fulfilled. There is simply no way to hold the curators accountable to their promise. 

Another very annoying thing on groover is, that there are curators that share your song on a playlist called ""groover selection/discoveries/blablabla"" that has 500 songs and 15 followers und you realize you just ended up on a graveyard created to earn all these nice groover credits from desperate musicians.   


What I have had very good experiences with, however, is contacting bloggers on groover. And since you said you're very active on social media, that's always nice to share and just gives you more presence, so maybe you might try that. 

But yeah, in the end, it is a semi-dubious jungle and you have to curate the curators yourself. Make ban lists, lists with curators you had good experience with and so on.

Of course your own targtetted marketing strategy should pay off more ( You seen Tom Dupree iii ) as you have total control over where you send promo to, and essentially if your material is in demand people will follow it regardless of Groover or anyone else.

Anyhow....I know Dorian ( the Groover guy) floats around these forums so maybe he will chip in, I can say that in my limited discussions with the Groover team there seems to be an intent at least to get the artist what they want.

That said, Im probably a small time curator in the scheme of things, but even I get a LOT of submission every week, I simply have to reject some as there not enough time, but there is clearly a business model here.

Few artists have lej their mark on a genre as ubiquitously as Mira &amp; Chris Schwarzwalder. Ajer more than a decade of shaping their brand of hypno\]cally-charged house with ethnic undercurrents – both individually and as a duo – Mira &amp; Chris follow up their 2020 summer hit ‘Déia’ with a long-awaited 5-tracker on Kiosk ID. ‘Cleo’ features two originals and three eclec\]c remixes by Argia, Hardt Antoine, and Jonathan Kaspar for catalog number 020.  
  
‘Cleo’ epitomizes the slow-burning aesthe\]c Mira &amp; Chris are known for in their B2B DJ-sets across the world. Contras\]ng darkly ominous chords with playful blips, organic percussion, and radiant synth progressions, ‘Cleo’ opens up airy worlds of mesmeric explora\]on anchored in a sub-heavy groove.  
  
Hardt Antoine’s up-tempo rendi\]on of ‘Cleo’ aroully reinterprets the original’s underlying tension. Cascades of rippling percussion, tearing sirens, thundering sub-hits, and a crackling electronica beat conjure waves of boSled-up energy that constantly threaten escala\]on.  
  
With ‘Jero’, Mira &amp; Chris explore deeper climes. Brightly shimmering chords and a resonant lead synth conjure an infec\]ous, evolving mantra framed by a compact beat. Aroully threading the needle between danceable, transcendental, and uplijing, ‘Jero’ showcases Mira &amp; Chris’s ability to turn subtle tension arcs into sprawling auditory journeys.  
  
Jonathan Kaspar reduces ‘Jero’ to its base-most elements and reimagines the original as a stripped, introspec\]ve groover. Mangled blips, warm pads, and beau\]fully resona\]ng salvos of malfunc\]oning machinery intertwine to create the soundtrack for a sunrise on a distant world.  
  
Argia’s Powerbeats Version infuses ‘Jero’ with harsher soundscapes and industrial undercurrents. Clanging percussion, washed-out vocal effects, and a building break imbue ‘Jero’ with searing edge and peak-\]me quali\]es.  
  
Mira &amp; Chris Schwarzwalder are synonymous with some of the most hypno\]c experiences in electronic music. ‘ Cleo’ delivers two slow-burning groovers and three eclec\]c reimagina\]ons that spearhead these experiences, showcasing Mira &amp; Chris’s ability to weave mesmerizing energy arcs, and conjure unparalleled dance floor moments.

julup5d,1691063146.0,musicmarketing,CherryShort2563,"Thanks for sharing your notes. This requires a thorough explanation, so I'll go line by line. 

\&gt; figure out your brand, target audience, creating good content and establishing a relationship with your fans.

I'm a promoter/manager for a couple of bands that write experimental/psychedelic rock music with a keen sense of melody. Most of them go back as far as the 90s and put out plenty of material on different labels. In other words no one I'm promoting is an amateur, they mostly got songwriting part figured out/play shows actively. 

I neglected Spotify in the past and I still think they should pay artists better. With that said, it proves a nice path to visibility. I saw Spotify number rising lately for people I'm promoting and its no coincidence, because I'm focusing heavily on that platform now.

\&gt; playlists are cool but very very rarely move the needle as artists seem to expect these days.

There are playlists like Experimental Fresh Finds and Modern Psychedelia that are exactly what I'm looking for, but I assume getting onto those won't be easy/I'll need to pay money. 

\&gt; so many of my artists land on them only to circle back because they didn't get the exposure they expected.

Fair enough - I paid Groover and so far its 1 placement out of 5. The problem is...artist I'm promoting is at #262 and in a list that mentions hip-hop/beats, though they're not a hip-hop band at all. Ton of likes for that playlist, though, so who knows...

In general, I agree - ""Its better to better to be seen/heard by 10 people that are here for you, than 100 that aren't"", in the words of one of my artistic buds. 

\&gt; do some research and look for smaller curators that actually care about the genre and putting artists on.

One recent placement came from Twitter and was the direct result of me sharing a link with a follower.",1,1.0,/r/musicmarketing/comments/15dl22b/so_how_does_one_starts_with_pitching_to_spotify/julup5d/,"Thanks for sharing your notes.

jpjtmrm,1687752501.0,trapproduction,AndrewSouthworth,"Here's a quick blueprint for music promotion:

1. Social media content
2. Paid social ads
3. Curator marketing

1. Social media - aim for creating 40-60 short form video clips for each song. This if very often not that time intensive, just performing the song in a cool place and chopping it into pieces...

2. Paid ads - If you had $1,000 put $900 into Facebook (Meta) ads and $100 into YouTube ads. TikTok / Snapchat ads also work, but they're more expensive than Facebook ads per result. Focus on conversion campaigns driving people directly to Spotify from a landing page.

3. Curator marketing - If you're in a genre that fits cleanly into a box, reach out to playlists / blogs / YouTube channels to share your song.   
This could be either done through email, or through platforms like SubmitHub and Groover. This could also include 3rd party playlisting companies, but just remember its hard to tell who is a good vs bad actor in this space. Budget-wise keep this much smaller than your ads.

I'm a big fan of the ads, but of course they require a budget. Additionally there is a learning curve with them if you've never done them before. But with them i've driven hundreds of millions of streams. 

Every Monday I send out a free [newsletter](https://www.musicmarketingmonday.com/subscribe) with actionable music marketing advice if that's your kind of thing. I also have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/andrewsouthworth) channel dedicated to music marketing.",1,1.0,/r/trapproduction/comments/14gr1bw/best_ways_to_promote_music/jpjtmrm/,"Here's a quick blueprint for music promotion 1.

jov2gcy,1687285722.0,musicproduction,marklonesome,"Fist off have a good product; good song, well produced and delivered. ""being good' is literally the lowest requirement.

After that....

From my albeit limited research you have a few legit ways.

1. Submitting to playlists which you can do through Spotify or with sites like Submithub or Groover. This costs money once you're out of Spotify.
2. Running ads on a social platforms and driving people to your music (also costs money).
3. Playing live and hoping people are able / interested in finding and following you.
4. Using an existing or newly created social media platform to get friends/followers.

Without work and/or money IDK of any way to get significant followers. If you have no social following and you aren't able to produce high engagement content in the form of TikTok videos that people WANT to watch then you're best bet is playlist submissions.

I've had *luck* with Submit hub in that 50% of my music gets placed (which is almost double the average) but that has amounted to a few hundred plays per song per month. 

That's a few hundred more than I'd have gotten without it cause I have no social and I don't play live so I'm happy with it but the notion that people are going to hear your music and it's going to blow up and go viral is sort of like hitting the lottery. Not saying you can't do it but the people who have done it usually always have a successful social platform to go along with it.

jo2rqr0,1686725408.0,musicmarketing,TheSlowMusicMovement,"I know I won't get any sympathy and that's fine but being a curator is really tricky. I receive a ton of great tracks that artists submit without obviously taking the time to flip through my playlists, read my blog or listen to the radio show, someting I totally understand, as time is an issue, especially if you are submitting to many curators. So my feedback can often be complimentary with a refusal at the end, due to suitability. Often the quality is great but it's a bit too commercial, sometimes a track is great but the vocal is a bit too generic. It doesn't mean that I don't appreciate the music, but I have to give a reason for refusal. Sometimes it's quite hard to quantify, it's just a vibe or feel, and then I'm trying to do this without offending the artist. It's quite a tricky thing to do when you are dealing with 400-600 submissions a month in my case, with many of the tracks being pretty poor quality. If you are bored then go through your Release Radar sometime, and write a yes or no+a reason why for each one, then multiply that by three. There are a lot of curators that receive far more submissions than me and to be honest I'm not sure how they do it, listening to lots of bad/average/good music to find the great tunes is quite mentally demanding. 

On top of that I follow 160 blogs, check the weekly release lists from several record shops, follow social media for tips, folllow 3500 artists, labels and fans on Bandcamp, 100s on Soundcloud and that's before all the 100s of weekly emails from artists, labels and PR companies that I receive. The competition is fierce so even if a track is good or great it's not always going to make the cut if there are a few better tracks. I can't lie mood also plays a part, sometimes I just want a vibe.

Don't forget as well that not all of the curators are English so translation might be an issue. Not all the curators might be well educated so expression or linguistic subtety/accuracy might be an issue? Maybe the curator is having a hard week - the dog died, they are sick, tired, there could be a million reasons the feedback isn't perfect.

Lastly as an artist I would say don't take it personally. Online communication/text messaging between people with no personal contact is open to a lot of interpretation and quite often an artists reaction is more about frustration about lack of success or recognition, often after years of practise or grinding, life is hard and rejection always hurts. As a label I deal with feedback that hurts as I want the tracks to be successful for my artists, for whom I feel a lot of responsibility, so I don't actually read most of it, apart from a few curators that I feel are more key to a tracks success and who I know whose judgement - bad or good, I can trust and respect. Then if it's a refusal I just shrug my shoulders and carry on hustling.

Submithub and Groover are actually quite unique in that you get feedback on a track, which makes them easy targets for artistic frustration. I send out hundreds of emails for each release to blogs, magazine, curators, tastemakers, playlisters, podcasters and radio stations and my response rate with feedback is probably around 1% and I often miss radio plays or it takes me a while to realise there is some coverage.

The modern music landscape is ridiculously tough to crack, the industry is hard to navigate and there has never been more competition - cover all bases, don't take it personally and keep grinding - that's often the main difference between those that make it and those that don't, dealing with 10 years of rejection before coming an ""overnight success.""",3,3.0,/r/musicmarketing/comments/1485gxa/submit_hub_for_genre_blending/jo2rqr0/,"I know I won't get any sympathy and that's fine but being a curator is really tricky.

Here’s what you need to feel totally sure he’s faking it: 

[SpotOnTrack](https://spotontrack.com) 
It’s an analytic tool where you can search playlists by their name or URL, and it will show you how many followers that playlist has gotten over time. Any dips or spikes in increments larger than 100 a day indicates bots. I’ve busted so many people trying to push fake promo using this site. You can even check the Instagram of artists to see similar statistics.

Another great tool for this kind of stuff is this:
[Is It A Good Playlist](https://isitagoodplaylist.com)

Here you can see the same backend data on playlists, but it also lets you search playlists you can SUBMIT to (meaning it’s not a Payola, or a pay-for-play, which btw is what your boy fake-Shawn-Mendez is doing) and you can search for specific playlists that are listed on trusted submission sites like Groover, and on isitagoodplaylist, you can verify the audience for that playlist before you ever submit. And when I say verify the audience, I don’t just mean looking to see if the followers have done the natural 0-to-whatever-number climb over time — I mean you can even see who’s on the playlist, what artists you’ll be related to due to that playlist, and more. Now you can use this to carve your own path to a (bot free!) Spotify growth — or you can just use it to snoop on the playlists fake-Shawn gets added to (which admittedly is why I bought the pro subscription).

Getting bot playlists adds does not equal success as an artist because labels can’t sell merch and concert tickets to a bot audience, so you ruin your chance of a record deal with that. And you can’t even successfully be an independent artist with bot playlists, because the “listeners also like” section is corrupted by bots, and that data is what Spotify’s algorithmic playlists use to decide who to show your song to when you’re on Release Radar (tier 2) and Discover Weekly (tier 1 and 2). Also - Spotify will only let you get away with this for so long. Once you are getting enough bot plays that you’re costing them real money (from paying out revenues for the bot plays) then they shut your account down. 

Email support@spotify.com to report Fake Shawn and (given his stream count) he will likely be shut down. It’s a little more tricky to get Spotify to care when their monthly listeners are below 50,000 — but you’re in luck. They very much care about anyone faking it at a level above 100,000 monthly listeners, because that costs SPOTIFY some real money. 

Just remember, fake Shawn has no real audience. Just bots. And so, he has what we call in the music business “vanity metrics” — and that is not a term used kindly. 

I’m dealing with this myself like I said. It’s disheartening to pour money into advertising with mediocre results and to have to shop around for playlists that you can verify as organic and then submit to them hoping they want your song — and then to see fake-Shawn’s just taking no kind of time or care and having twice the results to show for it. But just remember - it’s not real. And it’s meaningless if it’s not real. It’s an arms race in this industry, but I have to believe realness will prevail.

Another 'let's just jam opener' track to me. I actually preferred the GH3 cover of this over the original at one point in time. Just a fun little ditty of a track that was so close to making day 2

---

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this is my true 11 but it doesnt feel very in theme for the rate

**mysario** (10): Pat Benetar can't miss (though you probably should miss and not hit her)

**Poydoo** (10): Icon behavior

**vapourlomo** (10): In This House We Respect Pat Benatar

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): classic

**Frajer** (9): I also have a long history of having my heart broken by cookies

**qazz23** (9): the main riff is simple yet catchy and the vocal melody is good; great solo and vocals too; 🔥 awayyyyyyy!

**vayyiqra** (9): It's a classic but synthpop suits her better than rock I think (""Love Is a Battlefield"" is a perfect song, this is merely a good one, whatever) 🎸

**a-man-with-a-perm** (8): Catch me on Bumble with the ‘Real Tough Cookie with a Long History’ bio (I will never get a match)

**bogo** (8): good

**disintegrationpoops** (8): I mean its a great song if a bit simple

**kvothetyrion** (8): I kinda forgot how much fun this song was. Also I complete forgot there was a solo here. And I forgot that the solo rocks.

**sarcasticsobs** (8): This isn't Pat's best shot, but still is good

**systemofstrings** (8): Guitar hero. (Not available)

**TheTyrannicalTyrant** (8): not bad

**welcome2thejam** (8): Solid track, I don't think I could ever really turn down hearing this song, it's an instant mood booster

**tonirali** (7.6): that solo comes outta nowhere, a tad excessive imo. can you imagine Elliot Easton ripping something way more tasteful here? that’d be so cool.

**freav** (7.5): go pat

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.5): Fire awaaaaaay!

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (7.5): Sorry Pat, but your music mostly makes me want to listen to Joan Jett

**Eldritch-field-ditch** (7): It's a fine song.

**freeofblasphemy** (7): Solid groover that makes me wish I was listening to the Pretenders

**iBark** (7): of barrell aged malört

**SlowDownGandhi** (7): i feel bad rating this this low, gals can rock too dammit

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): another song where overplay really killed my enjoyment of it. still remember how this was the first song i ever full combo'd on expert though!

**TheCrakFox** (7): Vocals have chutzpa, the riff gets a bit annoying though.

**a\_gallon\_of\_pcp** (6.7): fire away

**gimme\_toro** (6.5): nah but I’ll hit you with my best six(point 5)

**Nagisoid** (6): It's fine I guess, cool lyrics for its time but it gets annoying quickly with how short and repetitive it is.

**IAmHollar** (5): Whatever. This is fine.

**MCK\_ROHCK** (5): Sure, I guess

**pig-serpent** (5): 🦈🦈🦈

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): I've played Heartbreaker with friends on some GH game before and it bopped much harder than this, surprised that song isn't here instead

**Wane\_WiredX-Plorer\_Lietoc** (5): yeah sure

**TroyBerryCrunch** (3): Catchy and cute, but kinda lame

**chug-a-lug-judy-nails** (1): i regularly forget this song is in this game and that's because it's not particularly fun

I usually get on the decks in the middle of the night, when everyone has the most energy. This Saturday, I felt like I played my best set yet. The party itself had a lot of competition in the city, plus it was pouring rain, so it wasn't as well-attended as my previous party, but everyone who showed up came to DANCE!

The opener did a seriously great job of getting everyone in the mood. I started it off with a great song that would set the tone for the rest of the night, then built the tension up with a series of groovers until it was time to just let loose. I kept the energy high and the dancefloor never stopped moving. Midway through the set, my gf distributed fresh fruit to everyone on the dancefloor and they loved it. In the latter half, I started mixing in some psytechno, which fit the mood perfectly.

Afterward, the feedback I got was amazing. I feel like it was probably my best set to date.

jb5aazr,1678116283.0,musicians,maestrosobol,"Spotify is kind of designed for passive listening. The best thing to do is get on some playlists. How to get on playlists is a complicated and time-consuming operation, there’s a lot of scams out there, and any pay for play is very likely not gonna break even, and worse, may result in Spotify demonetizing your music if they think you’re spamming or paid for fake streams. 

That said, it’s probably worth it to throw $100 each at SubmitHub and Groover. Those are vetted, legitimate and active curators and influencers who can get you internet presence, natural buzz, plays from actual playlists, and possibly more followers. You pay $1-2 for them to listen to your song and write you feedback. If they don’t listen or write back, they don’t get paid and you get your money back. 

These submissions also take time and you need to be authentic and write your pitches well and matching according to what they say they’re looking for. I did it and got on a ton of playlists and got some really great Instagram, Facebook, internet radio, local radio and blog shares. Now while I haven’t seen the return for my money in terms of short term streams, maybe long term it will even out, especially since I don’t have much data on the other platforms and some people don’t use Spotify. I figure at the least, it will feed Spotify some data that long term will tell the algorithm how my music connects with a particular listener and I’ll start to get some natural recommendations. 

I also got on some real playlists for free but it takes a lot more time. You have to search playlists and find their contact somehow (sometimes you gotta be super creative to track them down) and after you write a really sincere letter pitching your song and justifying why it matches their playlist, 80% will ignore you completely, 9% will deny you, and 9% will hit you up for money in exchange for playlist placement.

I had some complaints but they were more than properly addressed.

My experiences were:

-	listeners who had my genre listed as something they’re interested in insisted they only wanted other genres, so I had paid to show them something they were never going to share in the first place. Update: Groover responded that they have since updated that curator's profile and returned my payment for that curator.

-	what were supposed to be different listeners gave me 99% identical feedback, down to the specific phrasing. I had clearly paid multiple times to present my music to the same person.  Update: Groover responded that this is not allowed, will speak to the curator and returned my payment for that curator.

-	most other listeners gave such generic feedback that it was completely useless (literally: “great vibe and it’s a cool production but I won’t be able to share this one, hope you understand”). Update: Apparently my expectation that I'd get valuable feedback was mistaken. This is something I think could be improved on Groover's website.

I also produce music on the side and am working on an album. I do Pop/R&amp;B music similar to Justin Bieber, Chris Brown and Usher. When I first started I struggled with promoting myself but now I feel like I have it on lock. Here's what I did:

1. I upload my song to DistroKid at least 5 weeks before release. I do this because I think it's important to pitch to Spotify. I know the odds aren't good for an underground artist, but 1 editorial will change your entire music career. Then I go to Fiverr and pay someone to write a Spotify Pitch. Then I pitch my song to Spotify. 
2. While I'm waiting for release, I used to create like 10-15 lip syncing videos for the best 15 seconds of my song and post them on Insta Reels, TikTok and YouTube Shorts, 1 video every 3 days or so. 
3. 3 days before release, I go to Groover and pitch my song to playlisters using the same Spotify Pitch I used to pitch to Spotify. Initially I just used the recommended pitches generated by Groover. **DON'T DO THIS**. Organize your playlisters by ""top rated curators."" Actually click on their profile and see how many Spotify followers they have. For me, if they had over 5k I moved forward to step 2 which is: After that, actually click on their Spotify and see what playlists they have. Make sure they have a lot of like (for me it's like 5k or more as well) and make sure that your song fits the theme of that playlist. If all this checks out, then add it to your campaign, and then **BOOKMARK IT** into a custom list. Over a few releases, you will have a nice list that you can just click and submit instantly. But this process may take hours, but the frontload will be worth it with each subsequent release. My 5th release got over 10k streams just from Groover.
4. Subscribe to Playlist Supply and start looking for playlists using their search feature. Playlists that are reachable will have contact info in the description of their playlist. Reach out to them via Instagram asking for playlisting. Do your research on playlists to make sure they aren't botted. Use a YouTube Video for that, it would take too long for me to explain. Once you have a list of playlists you can directly pitch to, you can unsubscribe to Playlist Supply and now you have guaranteed streams from Groover and a list of good playlists you can pitch to. 
5. Use Facebook Ads. I use Toneden because they make the process much easier. What I do is I go to Pexels, and find 3 stock videos that are eye catching and relatable to my song. Then I put it into Premiere, edit the colors to make them pop (a lot of Pexels videos have pretty dull coloring so you might have to edit some coloring into them), put  15 seconds of my audio and export them. 3 days before release, I also pay $5 to a specific Fiverr freelancer who creates ""OUT NOW"" videos for Insta reels. Now I have 4 videos that I can use for Insta/Facebook ads. They have a pretty good algorithm where they will test all 4 videos for a few days, then identify which video is performing the best, and then start pushing that video out.

I am still learning other avenues of promotion but will probably make a post about it once I've streamlined my approach.","you probably have this on lock now, but i'll share my insight. i am a teacher and work full time. i also produce music on the side and am working on an album. i do pop/r&b music similar to justin bieber, chris brown and usher. when i first started i struggled with promoting myself but now i feel like i have it on lock. here's what i did 1. i upload my song to distrokid at least 5 weeks before release. i do this because i think it's important to pitch to spotify. i know the odds aren't good for an underground artist, but 1 editorial will change your entire music career. then i go to fiverr and pay someone to write a spotify pitch. then i pitch my song to spotify.  2. while i'm waiting for release, i used to create like 10-15 lip syncing videos for the best 15 seconds of my song and post them on insta reels, tiktok and youtube shorts, 1 video every 3 days or so.  3. 3 days before release, i go to groover and pitch my song to playlisters using the same spotify pitch i used to pitch to spotify. initially i just used the recommended pitches generated by groover. **don't do this**. organize your playlisters by ""top rated curators."" actually click on their profile and see how many spotify followers they have. for me, if they had over 5k i moved forward to step 2 which is after that, actually click on their spotify and see what playlists they have. make sure they have a lot of like (for me it's like 5k or more as well) and make sure that your song fits the theme of that playlist. if all this checks out, then add it to your campaign, and then **bookmark it** into a custom list. over a few releases, you will have a nice list that you can just click and submit instantly. but this process may take hours, but the frontload will be worth it with each subsequent release. my 5th release got over 10k streams just from groover. 4. subscribe to playlist supply and start looking for playlists using their search feature. playlists that are reachable will have contact info in the description of their playlist. reach out to them via instagram asking for playlisting. do your research on playlists to make sure they aren't botted. use a youtube video for that, it would take too long for me to explain. once you have a list of playlists you can directly pitch to, you can unsubscribe to playlist supply and now you have guaranteed streams from groover and a list of good playlists you can pitch to.  5. use facebook ads. i use toneden because they make the process much easier. what i do is i go to pexels, and find 3 stock videos that are eye catching and relatable to my song. then i put it into premiere, edit the colors to make them pop (a lot of pexels videos have pretty dull coloring so you might have to edit some coloring into them), put  15 seconds of my audio and export them. 3 days before release, i also pay $5 to a specific fiverr freelancer who creates ""out now"" videos for insta reels. now i have 4 videos that i can use for insta/facebook ads. they have a pretty good algorithm where they will test all 4 videos for a few days, then identify which video is performing the best, and then start pushing that video out.  6. i am still learning other avenues of promotion but will probably make a post about it once i've streamlined my approach.",615,True,True
