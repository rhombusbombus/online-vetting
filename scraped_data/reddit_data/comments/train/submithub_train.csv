kqnsuz4,1708071940.0,musicians,RobotMonsterGore,"I had success getting my monthly Spotify listeners up by using platforms like SubmitHub and Groover. Best case, my songs get playlisted. Worst case, I get feedback on why my songs weren't playlisted. 

I also post pretty heavily on Instagram and TikTok, with occasional paid campaigns as well. Most posts are short videos featuring the best parts of my best songs with Ken Burns style motions over Midjourney images, and titles showing artist and track name. Other posts include random images and videos that support my aesthetic vision or cover art of songs I'm currently into. 

I also run karma campaigns where I follow artists I like on multiple social media platforms. I comment on their posts and mention things like, ""found your song X on platform Y and I'm really into it"". Often they comment back, and it gives them an opportunity to check out my work if they're curious. This is a great way to network and find other artists interested in collaborations, and collaborations are *fantastic* ways to get your numbers up. 

Finally I'm active in FB groups where I can rub elbows with some pretty big names in my genre. I'm not on Discord yet, but that's next.

I'm one of the co-owner. I thought is was a good idea to give you a little lowdown on how our site works and of course it's also helpful for any other musicians who read this.  
**Musosoup works very differently from other platforms**  
**Quality Control**   
\- Unlike other platforms, we vet all musicians for quality control to Musosoup. Unless we feel they will connect with the 300+ curators using the Musosoup monthly, we simply don't let them in.  
**Costs**   
\- A campaign is £36 for 21 days, you can submit way in advance of your release to gain extra free campaign days. Eg: Submit a month in advance if your release and get a 51 day campaign for the same price.  
\- If you have no budget you'll still be able to apply for some free coverage in the marketplace and also accept free playlist adds and social shares from offers.  
\- If you have a budget you can extend your coverage in a pay-as-you-go method. This is explained below.   
\- **Each campaign garners normally around 30-70 playlist adds at no extra cost** than the campaign setup fee.   
**Offer System - Curators can approach you via what we call an offer.**  
\- Offers can have a contribution for creative time, marketing or hosting fees. We base the £ on a rough UK wage. For example, a blogger may ask for £5 contribution for 30mins worth of writing time. The average offer is £8, some are still free, or more depending on the time involved or reach. This gives a sustainable avenue for curators and an affordable PR model for artists  
\- If any cash is requested via an offer there is always a free option, 99% of the time these are playlists.  
**Musosoup's Marketplace**  
\- We also have a Marketplace which is a bit like the traditional model of artists applying like you may know on sites such as Submithub and Groover. Again ours is different, **you don't waste money via feedback** (feedback can be helpful sometimes).  
\- We have no feedback   
\- You can apply to curators but you don't waste any money if your music is not approved by the curator.

kpxua3v,1707665072.0,musicmarketing,Excess34,"what you're saying is what you're doing the minimum required to release music, and nothing to promote it. at the end of the day spotify is just another aggregator, a medium for you to build an audience on - it does not build it for you

The best you could hope for in 1990 was a used 4-track to make a shitty demo to shop around while playing to empty coffee shops and dive bars in hopes of getting noticed. Aside from a few scattered punk-ish collectives, there wasn't anything even *remotely* like social media at the time. 

And back in the day big artists got hosed left and right. I just saw some mess about how the wildly successful 90s R&amp;B group TLC sold millions of albums and toured for sold-out stadiums and took home something like $35k a year each. (Yes, that's like $70k in 2024 money, but still. What the actual *duck*.) 

So fuck it, do it yourself. No, it's not cheap. Yes, it's a huge amount of work. No, you're probably not going to see a lot of money unless you tour and move some serious merch. But my god you can reach *masses* of listeners in a matter of months without ever dealing with a label. I got playlisted via services like SubmitHub and Groover and purchased one (one!) cheap advertising package on TikTok and saw my numbers go from low double digits to well over 1,000 in a matter of weeks. That's almost two orders of magnitude. That's *insane*. And all this was *after* the same music was released by a reasonably strong label in my genre. The release itself did very little to boost the signal. All the heavy lifting fell to me. I've got more new music ready to go. You'd better *believe* I'm skipping the labels this time around. 

(Quick tip: Never spend money on music promotion services that approach you. Always approach *them*, and only deal with reputable names. Way too many con artists out there.) 

OH. And I heard some vague tea about one of the labels that I'm working with from a playlist curator via SubmitHub. Something about ""we usually don't showcase songs from label X, but we like your song, so congrats."" I was all like, why, what's wrong with my label? They alluded to some shady behavior but refused to say more. My imagination's running wild, so fuck *that*. 

So yeah. Stay independent. Don't sign. We live in a weirdly golden age of independent artists. It's still a crap shoot (your music has to resonate, you have to find your niche, you have to be a savvy promoter, etc), but the stars can align *so* much easier now than ever before. 

One last word of caution: social media sugar highs come at a cost. You still have to pump out quality music on a regular basis, and it might take months or years to resonate. You might have a viral moment, but those come and go quickly. Play the long game. Keep your head down and get back in the studio.

Haha or am I just being paranoid .,alot of people complain about submithub and groover. but honestly it's probably a good thing they aren't accepting everything. i feel like my music has only gotten better from their feed back over the years. however. i do think there is a bit of a popularity contest happening sometimes. i've found that my newer tracks are getting on more and more listing from groover and submithub. is my production really that much better? or do reviewers also look at how big the fan base the artist already has to see if it's worth sharing.  example. a song i released last year. barely got traction. this year i resubmitted it out to several other reviewers and got way more positive responses and yeses. we also played some big festivals and made lots of fans in 2023.  is this something you take into account when reviewing artists? haha or am i just being paranoid .,153,True,True

Despite this, I still use it and I'll tell people the reason why.

\#1 - You actually can get valuable feedback. Not just from playlisters (a lot of them are musicians themselves) but also from ""Hot or Not"". Quite a few times, I've received very helpful feedback on things that I wouldn't have gotten if I hadn't used the site.

...But a lot of the time, people just give generic comments too. So there's that..

\#2 - Submitting to real playlisters in the right genres during your release period can actually help boost your algorithm and help a new track get into Release Radar and Discover Weekly playlists.

\#3 - Somewhat a decent networking tool too. Found some great people on there that I've learned a lot from too.

I will say though be careful as there's some bot playlists on there...

You can always verify an authentic playlist by checking the background with a playlist analyzer like [isitagoodplaylist.com](https://isitagoodplaylist.com). Huge spikes and drops in growth (especially drops) is indicative of bots.

If you want to open Spotify and see a higher number next to your songs, then sure.

Fact is, you're paying regardless.

Getting on editorial playlists *is* possible but hard.

Getting playlists through Groover or Submit hub costs you, you just pay the service rather than the actual curator.

When you pay to get on a direct list one of two things usually happens. They either put you on a bot list or they drop you in a playlist that's already popular that may or may not have anything to do with your music.

I have a friend who used a pay service…I forget the name.

Anyway, they put him on a playlist that got him 15000 streams. But the actual playlist was all Elvis and Buddy Holly music … he's a Tame Impala type of musician BTW.

So basically he's on a popular playlist and for the people who were too lazy to change the song he got a play... 

BUT he *did* also get 10% of those people to follow him and add his song to their playlists. 

Is that worth it? 

Depends on you...

If you're seriously trying to make a career out of music. 

There's one way. 

Hard ass fucking work.

 You gotta grind socials every day, grind playing live and grind outputting good content on the regular.

Even then it will likely never pay you anything that you couldn't have gotten working anywhere else doing anything at all.

long story short.

kaa1e5w,1700643330.0,musicmarketing,Krimshaw_42,"So my personal biggest takeaway is unfortunately not a great one.  I think when I started a few years ago I saw more hope than I do now for indie artists, but there's still some good news as well.  A lot of the bad news is related and it boils down to a few things. 

- All Social Media has become hostile to creators / artists.  They have suppressed their algorithms.  Organic reach is nearly impossible.  This is not by accident.  They want you to buy Ads.  They need you to buy Ads because they're publicly traded companies who need to generate more and more revenue.  That's just how the market works.  They start cool and artist friendly (TikTok) - then they get a critical mass of users and start going way too heavy on monetization, effectively ruining what made the platform cool.   So it's not your imagination.  The deck is increasingly stacked against you.  Right now there are no artist friendly platforms. None.  Zero.   Threads could change that if they get hashtags and DMs going.  Until then they are a non factor.

Spotify and YouTube.  You need to understand these are not profitable businesses.  So while yes, they are not paying artists hardly anything, they aren't turning a profit either.  Streaming is not a good business model.  You have to remember that for 10 years all content was effectively being stolen on Torrents and Limewire and before that Napster.  Piracy wiped out the traditional music industry completely.  Streaming is an attempt to bring it back but even big artists are not making bank and neither is Spotify.  The money is in having fans.  Fans that pay to see you live.  Buy merch (although the overhead on that is not great, until you're moving huge amounts of it).  So realistically the game is this, get fans and play live shows - or sell them stuff.  Physical Media, or Merch if you don't plan on playing live.  Or you could go the influencer / Podcaster route.

That being said - Spotify still has a HUGE market share of streaming activity AND presents a massive opportunity to reach fans anywhere in the world.  This is the good news.  It's a global market!  When you dig into the data on Chart Metric - most of the biggest streaming markets are in Latin America.  They LOVE music down there and the currency exchange rate is extremely favorable. 

So, if you have a small marketing budget, I would honestly put it towards Spanish language Ads in Central and South America and also Portuguese Ads in Brazil. 

Then, very important, I would familiarize yourself with Google Translate.  This is the part of the job I enjoy most.  The most important thing you can do to turn a casual listener into a fan is actually very simple. 

Talk to them.  Technology is now a great tool and without speaking a word of Spanish you can have a full conversation with someone in Guatemala.  Who will actually be grateful to hear from you.  And you'll learn about other countries and their culture. Their perspectives.  And your money will go infinitely further than trying to compete in the oversaturated and incredibly expensive to advertise in Primary Markets that everyone is always advertising in.  You can also learn how to run ads for $1 / day until you get better at it and then apply what you've learned to the major markets. 

Other than that, the biggest thing I would suggest is having a decent playlisting budget.  Spotify claims payola isn't allowed but that is an outright lie.  Every decent playlist wants money or a paid service to reach the curators and Spotify does not enforce their policies AT ALL.  There are some free resources to help with playlists, and sure, you can spend all day pitching, but you won't move the needle without money.  Why is playlisting important?  If done correctly it will train the algorithm to recommend your song to the right people.  And that is when Spotify starts working for you, not against you.  You must pitch the right songs to the right playlists though. Really know your genre, sub-genre, mood, activity, target audience.  (Gym / Workout playlists are popular for example.  Summer Playlists.   Chill Playlists.  Driving Playlists.)  You need to know the playlisting landscape. There's over FOUR BILLION playlists on Spotify!  And very few good ones!

Free Playlist Services:
Soundplate.Com
DailyPlaylists.Com

Good Subscription Services:

Artist.Tools (most valuable because they have a bot vetting service that is very helpful)
Playlist Supply
Playlist Hunter

SubmitHub is good for hitting up a few dozen curators and maybe some influencer placements if you're on a budget.  $100 worth of credits can get you meaningful results

Playlist Push is probably the best premium service - starts at $297 though - goes up to $5k campaigns

Indie Music Academy also starts at $297 - if you just wanna get in some big playlists, guaranteed streams and juice your numbers, they start at 10k guaranteed streams

Then after that there's a bunch of smaller players or ones I've not read good reviews on that I wouldn't use

My artists I've worked with have small and tight budgets, and are self financing their careers, so we're always looking to stretch every dollar far as we can so I just thought that might help some of you out and answer some questions.  I'm happy to answer any specific questions but that's kind of the main overview of what I've learned in a couple years in this crazy ""business""

Long live independent music!

Screw the corporate gatekeepers and the big money keeping all you talented mofos down!

They start cool and artist friendly (TikTok) - then they get a critical mass of users and start going way too heavy on monetization, effectively ruining what made the platform cool.   So it's not your imagination.  The deck is increasingly stacked against you.  Right now there are no artist friendly platforms. None.  Zero.   Threads could change that if they get hashtags and DMs going.  Until then they are a non factor. Spotify and YouTube.  You need to understand these are not profitable businesses.  So while yes, they are not paying artists hardly anything, they aren't turning a profit either.  Streaming is not a good business model.  You have to remember that for 10 years all content was effectively being stolen on Torrents and Limewire and before that Napster.  Piracy wiped out the traditional music industry completely.  Streaming is an attempt to bring it back but even big artists are not making bank and neither is Spotify.  The money is in having fans.  Fans that pay to see you live.  Buy merch (although the overhead on that is not great, until you're moving huge amounts of it).  So realistically the game is this, get fans and play live shows - or sell them stuff.  Physical Media, or Merch if you don't plan on playing live.  Or you could go the influencer / Podcaster route. That being said - Spotify still has a HUGE market share of streaming activity AND presents a massive opportunity to reach fans anywhere in the world.  This is the good news.  It's a global market!  When you dig into the data on Chart Metric - most of the biggest streaming markets are in Latin America.  They LOVE music down there and the currency exchange rate is extremely favorable.  So, if you have a small marketing budget, I would honestly put it towards Spanish language Ads in Central and South America and also Portuguese Ads in Brazil.  Then, very important, I would familiarize yourself with Google Translate.  This is the part of the job I enjoy most.  The most important thing you can do to turn a casual listener into a fan is actually very simple.  Talk to them.  Technology is now a great tool and without speaking a word of Spanish you can have a full conversation with someone in Guatemala.  Who will actually be grateful to hear from you.  And you'll learn about other countries and their culture. Their perspectives.  And your money will go infinitely further than trying to compete in the oversaturated and incredibly expensive to advertise in Primary Markets that everyone is always advertising in.  You can also learn how to run ads for $1 / day until you get better at it and then apply what you've learned to the major markets.  Other than that, the biggest thing I would suggest is having a decent playlisting budget.  Spotify claims payola isn't allowed but that is an outright lie.  Every decent playlist wants money or a paid service to reach the curators and Spotify does not enforce their policies AT ALL.  There are some free resources to help with playlists, and sure, you can spend all day pitching, but you won't move the needle without money.  Why is playlisting important?  If done correctly it will train the algorithm to recommend your song to the right people.  And that is when Spotify starts working for you, not against you.  You must pitch the right songs to the right playlists though. Really know your genre, sub-genre, mood, activity, target audience.  (Gym / Workout playlists are popular for example.  Summer Playlists.   Chill Playlists.  Driving Playlists.)  You need to know the playlisting landscape. There's over FOUR BILLION playlists on Spotify!  And very few good ones!

k9gre1k,1700112533.0,metalmusicians,Whyunopraisethesun,"I posted a long guide how I released my first full length album a year ago. It's a long read but maybe answers some of your questions. I'll repost it below:


 I consider the release of my debut album ""Vampiric"" a success. I am a bedroom musician working alone, as many of us are, writing, recording, producing, releasing and promoting music all by ourselves. The tips I've read about promotion are rarely that good or simply outdated. That's why I want to share some concrete advice everyone could have some use for.

**The stats**

During the first week my album got [4,400 streams on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1jESTrMysbrWrEWc0fC4Ts?si=ba7d9076399e4e13) and [2000 streams on Bandcamp in the app](https://clayshaper.bandcamp.com/album/vampiric-2). 61 fans decided to purchase the album for a price they found fair and 171 downloaded it for free. I earned around $200 just from sales.

**The hard truth** 

Nobody gives a shit about you or your 'new' music. Making good music is just the bare minimum of getting any attention at all. 2022 people are very, very, focused on the visual aspect of whatever you're trying to promote. Pure music is neither visual nor easy to access as most people on their phones won't put in headphones or start the sound just for some random guy. Good music can spread by itself, but it's so rare it's almost a myth at this point. But there are ways getting around this.

**Social Media presence**

[My main channel of communication is Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/clayshaper/). I've found that by using hashtags, following and talking to interesting people and releasing simple videos of me performing my music is the best way to reach out. Battling the algorithm is much harder on Twitter and Facebook, even though sharing links is easier on those platforms. I focus all my energy on Instagram, cross post everything on Facebook, copy paste and shorten for twitter and release longer, high quality content for Youtube to promote my music. If I have vertical video of a performance I will post it on IG Stories, TV, Reels, Youtube Shorts and TikTok. 

**Getting around it**

If people want visual, I give them visual. I started sharing my own photographs and curated contemporary/old art I like (always got permission if it wasn't in the public domain) and transitioned into posting my own art alongside videos of me performing my music. Now people stay for the art and may give my music a chance. I've been doing this for four years and are near [22,000 followers on Instagram.](https://www.instagram.com/clayshaper/?hl=en) Cross platform I have around 29,000 followers (Bandcamp, Spotify, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok). I put no effort into the other ones, but they keep growing there too because of the cross posting.

**Growing a fanbase**

\* Every platform wants to keep it's users on that platform, so I rarely use links just to see my YouTube views get inflated by a couple of clicks, for example. Build a fanbase by grinding on that platform, and call to action down the line when it matters. Don't expect to grow by spamming links.

\* Content that's purely music is hard to pierce the buzz, especially extreme music. Are you a streamer? Artist? Videographer? Photographer? Do you like to cook? Lifestyle enthusiast? Dancer? Working with clay? Literally anything else that's visual can be used to boost your music. But this is just how I like do it.

\* Releasing singles keeps the attention of your fans. Releasing an album creates a bigger buzz. Don't bother sending singles to journalists and reviewers, but absolutely make an effort to promote an album.

**Chronological: The release**

\* Completed the album and put it up on a music distribution service. [Distrokid is popular](https://distrokid.com/vip/seven/1416772?gclid=Cj0KCQjwqPGUBhDwARIsANNwjV7ufQT9m2FUheHzP027Tw0EDIghNMPYra6XawyJzzeWmC84ljnucbcaAnAoEALw_wcB) and has a monthly cost but unlimited uploads. I use [Emubands](https://www.emubands.com/simple-pricing/) to keep all royalties and do album uploads with one time lifetime costs.

\* Claim my Spotify artist page and pitch a song on the album to their editorial theme. My song didn't make the cut, but if accepted it's huge. Do this at least a month prior to release.

\* Began posting short snippets of me playing the new songs to create a hype.

\* Filmed and released a [music video all by myself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnDVvCeRMMU). Posted this on Reddit and submitted the video to YouTube channels like BlankTV and Black Metal Promotion.

\* Ran a small giveaway (band patches) for people who pre-saved the album on Spotify via [smart.url.](https://manage.smarturl.it/)

\* Looked up reviews of bands that sounds like me, gathered the email addresses of those blogs and news outlets. I gathered around 150 of them and blasted out a press release consisting of album art, pictures of me, the songs, a private album stream, some information about the album and my band and quotes by me about the album. This got me featured on [MetalSucks and a couple of other sites](https://www.metalsucks.net/2022/05/26/exclusive-album-stream-clayshaper-spread-their-black-and-poisonous-wings-on-vampiric/). Make it easy to write something interesting about you. Bloggers love fast and easy content.

\* On release I put out [one more music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lwxHgefgm0) video done with a single camera and me in the woods.

\* Submitted my music to 17 metal playlisters on [submithub](https://www.submithub.com/). Was accepted by half of them.

\* Ran Spotify ads on Facebook for $50 for great results. [I followed this tutorial to set them up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klB5Iq8e7sU)

**Ending**

I have made over 30 demos on compilations and EP:s since I started CLAYSHAPER back in 2018. I know 4,400 doesn't sound like much, but seeing actual people listening to your music in real time on Spotify's dashboard is a cool feeling. Receiving comments about AOTY is also humbling. I hope you as a reader got something out of my little write up.

From my experience, I would recommend starting social media marketing earlier and really investing into it as an entertainer. Notice how I said not as a musician. Give people entertainment value and you'll do a lot better. If you try to only just plug your music and streaming platforms, content doesn't do well.

I would also recommend using all the tools Spotify for Artists gives to you (bio, links, artist picks, merch, featured playlists, discovery mode, etc. And upload regularly. Spotify is a social media platform, like any other platform. Using all their features, and regularly uploading and getting good engagement is how you get on their good side. And then Spotify honestly does a lot of the work for you.

What I wouldn't recommend is to get random streams and listeners. Instead, focus on the people who will engage with your content - Full listens, playlist adds, saves, repeat listens, shares. If you just plug your music randomly, you'll have a bad algorithm, and having a good Spotify algorithm is what makes you take off. Even worse, people that buy streams or fake playlists, or 3rd party marketing services absolutely destroy their algorithm. At that point, good luck finding any real listeners. Because there's no sensical data from all the bots streaming the music, that Spotify has no idea who to promote your music to anymore.

As for services I recommend, I use isitagoodplaylist.com to check the background for any playlists (if I want to submit to playlists) to make sure they're not botted or fake playlists. Sudden spikes or dips in followers is a HUGE red flag and means botted.  
I'm lukewarm towards Submithub. It's alright, and I've found some fake playlists there too. But overall, most of the curators are legit.   
Honestly, I recommend Reddit and TikTok. Seems to be the platforms I've had success on. Also Spotify ads ain't bad if you can dial into your audience. 

I don't recommend any 3rd party promoter, most of it is just garbage (Actual legit content promotion will start at the thousands of dollars). I don't recommend most sites where you pay for playlists (submithub is ok I guess b/c most of the curators are legit. But still check). And any ""quick"" seeming option to get streams or blowing up is a huge red flag.

My biggest mistake is not starting sooner. I was also waiting for the perfect moment. I've been a musician for 15 years and would never finish any of my compositions. I only started to finish them when I started releasing them (because I would hold myself to a deadline each month).

&amp;#x200B;

My plans for the future is to :

\-start a professional website 

\-remastering all my tracks (I'm a terrible producer, my strengths more lies in composing piano music and playing piano)

\-Make re-imagined versions of all my music

\-Grow my patreon

\-Notate all my music down into writing (sheet music)

\-build a massive library of original sheet music to sell (already doing decent)

\-join an official licensing library (so my music can be used in media like movies, games, and other media)

\-Have custom animated visual loops for all my music

\-Have custom art for all my music (Right now sometimes I to buy a stock license for some of my album art)

\-Keep getting better as an artist, composer, pianst and producer

The thing you need to know about Submithub is that you NEED to be applying to the right playlists.  You could have the greatest Indie Pop song in the world, but if you aren't carefully selecting playlists which want that genre of music, you are throwing your money away.

k5z124k,1697986748.0,musicmarketing,rort67,"I just want to add my experiences with Submithub and not necessarily make a judgement. As with people in general you will find a variety of curator personalities. Some may be just doing it for a few extra bucks and not really putting much effort into it and some may be hardcore music lovers who want to help artists. There will also be all those in between. I used to, first submit my solo material (which is no longer on Spotify) and then my band, Worm Grunter.

 The first issue I ran into were the curators who said they accepted this and that type of music but then I heard back and they said they didn't. That was confusing and made think that if they didn't update their description of what music they now reviewed, how can they actually be doing a good job at song placement. Secondly, the curator I suspect didn't actually listen to my song. Once when I submitted one of my solo songs which just had guitar and vocals and the curator commented that he really loved the drums. I contacted him asking if he had me confused with another artist or did he really listen to the song. He never responded back. It me wonder how many other curators maybe just ran the song for 60 to 90 seconds, maybe on mute just to meet the time requirement in order to keep the money. I don't know how Submithub checks to see if the curators are fulfilling the requirements to continue to stay on the site.  These are just the two that standout as examples of why I think the platform overall is waste of not only money but hope. There were many other minor oddities that I ran into over a couple of years that were also red flags. The last thing about Submithub I want to point out is that since the curators are only obligated to list to the first minute to minute and a half, the artist is forced to put the hook in right away or within that time frame. No long intros. Not unconventional song structures. I use Locomotive Breathe by Jethro Tull as an example. It has an almost minute and a half intro of guitar and piano interplay before it really gets going and the chorus comes after the first verse. That song, as great as it is, would get rejected by 100% of Submithub curators as far as I'm concerned.

IMO, playlist chasing overall can be a soul sucker. I know that it's one major way to have listeners find you but there so many politics involved. Most playlists have a small number of followers so you are forced to find and try to get on hundreds if not thousands over the course of a year until you have the traction to get onto better, larger ones. That takes an immense amount of time and energy. Time and energy away from actually creating the music. I think most here would agree that once you're rotated off the list (most times within a few weeks, sometimes less) you don't retain many if any of the listeners not matter how often you put up new music.

k5mpe4w,1697765486.0,musicmarketing,count_zackula,"I would say it depends what genre you’re releasing with - the editorial staff at DSPs like Apple and Spotify have changed drastically in the past year. Of course, it helps to have a label backing you (even small indie ones), as they often have connects at these DSPs and can get your song to the right ear. This is particularly how you see artists with little to no audience and nothing released get their first releases on editorials. 

That being said, I know people who’ve gotten placements on official playlists with self-released tracks just by pitching through Spotify for Artists (no equivalent for Apple yet). I can tell you with complete certainty that your profile on Spotify doesn’t matter all that much - the quality of your pictures, what you write in your bio, pretty much irrelevant. 

Your music counts. Make it good and release it as consistently as you can. When you’re pitching, give a good description of the track, say where you’re based, and feel free to suggest a couple of fitting playlists. 

Spotify used to be more of a level playing field. I remember when you could contact curators directly through google forms. Unfortunately not the case anymore, due both to over-saturation and a lot of major label involvement with DSPs. Not to mention them blindly favouring whatever is going viral on TikTok and Insta right now. 

Don’t sleep on indie playlists and blogs. I would not recommend sites like PlaylistPush or Groover (as someone who’s been a curator). Just not a fan, and seems pretty low value. Submithub works and is my favourite of these types of sites. Again, make sure your description and profile is up to date, and submit to the right places - blogs included. Write ups (and sites like Hype Machine) used to be more important, but they still hold some value. 

Best of luck, don’t stop what you’re doing just because of a lack of attention from Spotify and the like. This industry isn’t easy and thrives on personal connections. But it’s really about the music, don’t forget that. 

Hope that was of some help!

If it's your first release, your first priority, in my opinion, should be producing more - show people your style, demonstrate a consistent level of quality, give people more to get into.

But what I have had is DMs from other artists telling me my tracks should be on the radio, and one person saying they hope my second album becomes a cult classic.

Don't be that guy who makes one track, then rage-quits when it isn't an instant success. If you build it, they will come. And you should *want* to build it, because if all you're after is quick fame and easy money, this isn't the place to be.

If I am going to pay I would rather pay for a specific placement than the chance to maybe get featured. I wouldn't say I have had amazing results but I don't feel ripped off either. 

Practically though outside of that I think there's a lot that could be improved. I used to get featured on Hype machine blogs really early on like 12 years ago. That was the golden age of the music blog and even then I don't think any of the placements I got (for free) would have been worth a dollar. Considering that many of the blogs on submithub seem to have less readership than the older ones that would feature in hype machine I just don't really see the value proposition.

In general I think they need to be more discerning with their curators because I find there's a lot who just don't seem to have much following, yet there's also seemingly a shortage in the indie rock world. I see in this thread you can search by similar artist now - that might have improved it because when I last used I used to struggle to find anything that really made sense with my canrock revival meets 70s art rock sort of indie sound.

The other thing I find odd is that having done paid submissions there and also contacted playlist curators directly after searching similar artists on playlist supply, I get featured on the majority of playlists I contact directly and I don't think I have ever gotten an approval on submithub. Again this might be a genre thing since I can hone in on playlisters with of Montreal or with artists with similar flamboyant images to my own, which I can't tend to find on submithub, but I also wonder if getting a ton of paid submissions leads to the playlisters being less likely to accept any.

At its core I just think there's too much cannibalism in the industry and I question the vast amount of services looking for a slice of the artists' pie.

k40r1o6,1696788762.0,musicmarketing,nick_minieri,"I agree with a lot of this. Used to use submithub as a vital promotion technique but have come to find that even when I'm added to decent sized playlists, it barely moves the needle with the number of streams I end up getting. Often times the track is buried at the bottom of the playlist, with the tracks at the top of it being ones produced by the curator themselves mixed with huge tracks on the charts. Aside from 2 or 3 exceptions, I don't think I've ever gotten more than 50 streams from a submithub playlist add. And they've all been passive listens that almost never turn into actual fans.

Hot or Not is still something I find useful, and often test market unreleased tracks of mine there before shopping to labels. I do agree that much of the feedback is positive or unconstructive, but the 3 or 4 critical comments I get have really helped me quite a bit.

OT yea alot of aspects in submithub is super sketchy but I'm not going into details,most curators I believe want music they can listen to for 20 sec to say ""oh this reminds me of XYZ so that means this automatically is good too""

I also strongly believe some curators look up artists if they have a strong follower base/accumulated streams, and if they don't they're not going submit them.

fair to say even if you're making music that's wery different and unique you could still find some decent people on there and get on good playlists with organic listeners

Playlisters: Submitting to playlists that actually have music that’s in your genre and only music in your genre. Screw submithub and all the other websites, pay for actual search tools that let you find playlists based on songs in them and the. find ways to reach out to those playlisters instead.

k3aylvl,1696351346.0,musicmarketing,FranzAndTheEagle,"There's two prongs on the fork, I think: 

One is engagement with your local scene. If you gig, pick good gigs, play the right rooms, and network with other musicians. My first fans - and my most loyal - in every band I've ever played in were *other musicians*. They get it, the understand the struggle, they understand how much it takes, and if your shit is good enough to listen to, they'll listen to it loyally. On gigs, ignore the common advice to ""take any gig you can get."" I think that's actually a bad idea, as shitty gigs at shitty venues played to empty or nearly empty rooms aren't helping you. Fewer, better shows is a better move, though there may need to be a few tough ones up front to get your name out there at all. Avoid taking shitty gigs as soon as you can. If you have local music shops, guitar shops, record stores, go in there and get to know the employees. These are also, by in large, musicians or enthusiasts. Don't walk in and ask them to listen to your record, try to become a regular, be a good customer, and eventually mention your work. Connect with them, and they'll often connect back to you.

Second is the internet. It's a bit weird, but I noticed during a promotion run for a record last year that in some cases, local, insular scenes need outside encouragement to believe something. I can know a record is good and worth hearing, but struggle to get the local scene to pay it any mind. In the case of this one recent record, all it took was *one* good review from a blog in another country that had a few other, more well-known acts on its page, and the next thing I knew the whole local scene was on-board. I tracked the engagement, and it really was pretty directly related. This review went up, and within the next 3 days my local engagement numbers were way up. It's like walking by a restaurant and thinking it looks pretty good, vs having someone else tell you it is, I think. Submithub got me in the door there, but from that point it was a matter of establishing a human connection with the reviewers. DM them on IG, email them if you can, start a *real conversation* that goes beyond the piddly pitch you can throw at them on the platform once you're through the approval stage. 

It's important to set your expectations. What does a successful release look like for you? What are the *numbers*? How many unique listeners, how many streams in a specific time period? If you never define these things, it will be difficult to feel successful because you have no measuring stick.

I've been creating electronic music for over 15 years, but only recently felt confident enough to share it on streaming platforms. But I've checked your music out and while some people here really go hard on the hate, I gotta say man I can't get into it. But I gotta hand it to you, you do keep going and that's in itself a little impressive.

  
It is, however, essential to take people's advice to heart. I always ask my direct connections and a bunch of strangers (on SubmitHub) for their feedback. It can sometimes be harsh, but I try to read what they're trying to say about my music and not take it personally. Waving them away with 'music is subjective' and whatnot isn't gonna help. Like, I'm working on a track now that has a very good mix, menacing energy, solid sound design, but I get the feedback from multiple people that it's a bit repetitive. What do I do? Send them a message saying 'well, I can enjoy it for 4 minutes without getting bored' and then not think about how to make it less repetitive? No. I take a good hard look at my song and try to come up with some cool ideas to make it better. And while I was able to enjoy it in its repetitive state, I managed to make it better.

  
I'd advise you to take people's advice to heart, however unbelievably rude some of them have been, and put the time and money you've been putting into ads, arguing and those autobiographies, and put it into worthwhile practice of your singing, playing, and engineering. Maybe do that for a good while, start a new moniker and SoundCloud profile and then see if people will notice your music by themselves.",1,1.0,/r/u_Imbred-/comments/bcmuy9/hi_i_am_a_songwriter_who_makes_punk_and/k2fafk4/,"After seeing this ad pop up numerous times in the past years I decided to get into the comments and, just, wow...

Yea, if it doesn't take off or at least display a steady growth in listeners/streams/likes/etc., Then it is prolly not gonna do a whole lot better with a bunch of promo. I mean unless it is really good marketing, in which, even then the chance retaining those ears is not very good.
There is no genius marketing company that has it all figured out or a magic wand for gaining streams and fans. The main fact behind all the facades that these marketing companies lead one to believe, comes down to one thing: 
Create Great Music! 
It pushes itself like good drugs. You don't see no ads for good drugs but, I bet you can find them by asking around to people you know. Same thing with music. Word of mouth is the best marketing there is! Hands down! And its free! People tend to find the music they enjoy and when one does, they will spread it for you.
Lastly, I'm not saying yours doesn't fit the bill as I have no clue cause I've never heard it. However, I have learned a few things pertaining to your question, and just wanna be clear what is most important in gaining fans and followers:
-Enjoy yourself and love what you are making! 
-Make genuine, real, and good quality music that touches people emotionally, being relevant and relatable. 
-Thats it. The rest will happen naturally...
(In my humble opinion that is....)

Wish you success!","well, taking into account one would at least have social profiles for their band/music, that they release on. as well as, other places like here on reddit, where there are a bunch of music communities actively seeking and listening to new music, pitching to independent playlist curators, spotify playlists curators, and posting on the many ""artist social media platforms"" like slaps, bandlab, submithub, etc. (all of which i would consider to be standard protocol at this point, for any serious artist/band)   yea, if it doesn't take off or at least display a steady growth in listeners/streams/likes/etc., then it is prolly not gonna do a whole lot better with a bunch of promo. i mean unless it is really good marketing, in which, even then the chance retaining those ears is not very good. there is no genius marketing company that has it all figured out or a magic wand for gaining streams and fans. the main fact behind all the facades that these marketing companies lead one to believe, comes down to one thing  create great music!  it pushes itself like good drugs. you don't see no ads for good drugs but, i bet you can find them by asking around to people you know. same thing with music. word of mouth is the best marketing there is! hands down! and its free! people tend to find the music they enjoy and when one does, they will spread it for you. lastly, i'm not saying yours doesn't fit the bill as i have no clue cause i've never heard it. however, i have learned a few things pertaining to your question, and just wanna be clear what is most important in gaining fans and followersenjoy yourself and love what you are making! make genuine, real, and good quality music that touches people emotionally, being relevant and relatable. thats it. the rest will happen naturally... (in my humble opinion that is....)   *(this is not to say you shouldn't use promo or media marketing company's. because they can help alot too, but only if the song/artist/band has found some initial success to provide the best chances for making all the time and effort worth it.  hence my post.) **good luck on your musical journey! wish you success!",375,False,False

jz4t9gh,1693854980.0,musicmarketing,marklonesome,"No real secrets.

There are different ones with each having slight variations but the two I use are:

Submithub and moonstrive.

Submit hub allows you to search and find curators based on various parameters.

Then you pay to send them one of your songs for consideration.

They will review it and either add it or send you a few words as to why they didn't. The reviews are pointless for a ton of reasons so I largely ignore them. From playlists you get put on you'll get a few hundred listens.

Moonstrive is a little different.

You send them your tune and they find playlists for you. The size of the playlists are based on how you pay. For the cheapest amount you go on lists with about 50K listeners or so.

From that you can get anywhere from a few thousand to several thousand listens. 

Here's the thing.

It's all bullshit.

It's hard to measure the success of it because people generally don't stop what they're doing and go find a band that came on that they liked and suddenly add them, buy their music etc..

The best metric I can gauge is wether they saved the song or added it to their personal playlists. 

For that, I'm seeing about a 10% conversion.

So, for every thousand that hear it, about 100 add it to their personal playlist or save it.

Pro music marketers would tell you you're wasting your money because the relationship is transactional and you're not building a fan base and you're not able to measure the metrics truly. This is hard to argue but for people, like myself, who have the money and would rather skin myself with a rusty carrot peeler than create social media content... it's the only other game in town, that I know about.

It seems that you have seen a few young beat producers become really successful with type beats and you want a piece of the pie - without doing what they did. Many of these type beat producers follow an insane grind: 

- post beats daily on YouTube, Soundcloud and Beatstars, 

- post videos in IG and Tik Tok daily, 

- create new videos,

-  follow the latest charts to be the first to produce type beats for an upcoming artist, 

- comment on new releases, 

- DM producers constantly... 

see, how none of this is beat-making? And they're creating, just like you 15 beats a day besides this. And have terabytes of folders of beats and skits. Just so you know what you want to skip.

You said you're almost 40 and live in South-eastern Europe, the balkan area. There are a couple of directions you can go.

1. If you want rappers to use your beats and make money with that, stay local! From what I heart the Balkan hip Hop scene is incredibly vibrant. Follow rappers on IG/TT, dm them beats, send beats to other local producers, find local rappers and producers on Soundcloud. But this is going to take at least 2 years of doing this, every. damn. day. You can't just DM a rapper once, of upload a b beat once.  Every single day. Because only over such a long period of time will artists take you seriously. 

2. If you want to go in a direction of releasing instrumentals, I would suggest this: 

3. find artists that sound similar like you.
4.  Find out what they do on Social Media, 
5. try to find playlists that their tracks are on. 
6. Try using something like Submithub to get placements on playlists. 
7. Release consistently. Others have said this. But release tracks weekly if you can. Don't worry about albums in the beginning, do singles and EPs. And a lot of them. 
8. You've started your journey here, good! But research about ways to promote your music is absolutely essential. There are a gazillion guides and videos about that online. Get a grip of the essentials, then look at artists in your niche. 
9. Find sync agencies and research their contacts. This is a much more difficult game to get into, but much more lucrative than streaming can ever be.

jyemkpn,1693418276.0,musicmarketing,NovaNewChorus,"Submit hub is bad IMO. I think the whole business model is not a good one.

Good feedback for musicians is usually not ways to improve a specific track. It usually comes from people that understand the musician and have given their work some thought. The actual feedback is less ""You need to do this specific thing,"" and more ""this other artist does this thing you might like,"" ""have you thought of doing this thing here,"" or even just going to a concert or hearing an album and getting inspired. Most of the feedback I get from submithub users is ""Needs a better mix"" ""I really hated the vocals"" ""I really loved the vocals"".

What I want from submit hub is just a way to get my music in front of more people that like the vocals. I have a song that has like a 50% rating that is my highest played song on spotify and my friend tells me they love it and have it on repeat on a playlist.

To get better at music you really need to be engaged in your craft and engaged in your community.

To make the mix better, I don't really need ""needs better mix"" comments and a bad rating from someone who doesn't even get my music. I need to hang around musicians in my genre and talk to them, play shows, and engage with fans irl. Or know how social media algorithms work to target my stuff to people who will actually like it.

I've gotten rejected from every playlist I've submitted to and my budget for this stuff is $0.

I'm not complaining. I'm not saying that people owe me respect or fame or money or anything.

I'm just saying in practice the best thing I can do as an artist is work on my craft and perform. The art that is really good is just going to pop off no matter what I do, and the less inspiring or mainstream stuff will be stuff that no matter how hard I try to push it through a rating system, it will fail.

It's a lot easier for me to just build a community and make art.

I know it sounds silly, but part of the reason why people pay for services like submithub is because there's this huge misconception that you can just market your way into success. But the reality is you can't. Record labels take on entire rosters of artists every year and you often only hear of 1 of them. But they marketed them all.

The best success ive had is through their connections to radios and other industry types. There is still a place for labels, and to promote in concert yourself alongside them.

FB ads are a waste of time and money for musicians. You get a bunch of people accidentally engaging and it automatically asks them generated responses. It was weird. FB generally has more diminishing value for musicians these days, beyond simply havingvs oresenxe and linking to other online sites.

My point on the curators is that it doesn't necessarily translate to tangible gains. It's like link swapping on SubmitHub chat.

jxr3zts,1693000526.0,musicmarketing,MysticCherryBlossom,"I haven't used playlistpush. 

I tried SubmitHub but only ever got rejected. I got tired of tracking down curators, listening to their playlists for like 30 minutes to make sure it was a good fit, writing a pitch to submit, and then still ultimately getting rejected so I decided I would just pay people to push my songs for me. No, I'm not talking about paying people to place me on a playlist (that's probably botted), but paying to have 3rd parties push my songs to legitimate curators.

So far, I have used YouGrow, Indie Music Academy, and Partnered Projects. There's dangers in using services like those too. In case you do decide to go this route:

YouGrow will 100% get you fast streams, but as someone mentioned, it was mostly Latin American streams, which probably fucked up my algorithm. You live and you learn right?

Indie Music Academy probably gave me the best results. I got on a great playlist, got some really good streams, got added to some other playlists from just being on that one, someone actually reached out to me on IG after finding me on this playlist, and I still get some streams on that song from people who found me on this playlist (not a lot but still more than any of my other songs). Couple of things about them though, they were only able to find placement for 1 of the 3 songs I submitted to them(refunds are guaranteed if they can't place you). And, it takes them fucking FOREVER to place you. Like, it took me weeks before they placed my 1 song, and then like a month or two before they told me they couldn't place me for the other 2. That's a LONG time. I didn't realize how long and thought this was normal until I tried Partnered Projects.

After Indie Music Academy kept being unable to place me, I tried Partnered Projects. They have somewhat of a co-sign from Andrew Southworth, so I figured they were probably legit. It only took them a few days to place me, and they were probably the best at actually placing me on RELEVANT playlists. The promotion I started with them is currently still running, so I am not sure how good the long term effects will be but I am happy enough with the results I want to use them again. In fact, probably going to use them for the song I just released AND the one after that. They also don't guarantee you placement, so they don't charge you until they have secured you a placement.

Anyway, paying for playlisting in anyway isn't a great idea (saying this as someone who does it) since as I mentioned it can fuck up your Spotify algo if you end up on the wrong playlists and also the long term benefits are questionable. While I got on some personal and smaller playlists from being on these paid playlists, I didn't gain any followers from it. So, lots of short term listeners, a few long term listeners of those particular songs, but no actual fans.

Only reason I still use this method is because this is the only method where I have seen SOME positive gains. I am currently promoting my new song harder than I have promoted ANY song ever (haven't paid to have it pitched for playlisting yet) by using ads on IG while also posting regularly on TikTok and YouTube. So far, the results have been abysmal (it's only been a week so far), so yeah...I can only do what I can until I start performing live, which will hopefully be the push I need to actually start gaining a following.

I really think the “music business” has changed but no one will tell you how it’s changed. Here is how I see it now. Music is consumed today much like a Netflix series. You work all year making this thing you are super proud of. People rip through it in a day and go “when’s the next one coming out?” It’ll break your heart so there’s a way of getting around this. Make a bunch of music you are super proud. Maybe 20 songs or so. Then instead of releasing an “album” release them one at a time every week on Spotify ? YouTube or whatever. Just keep ‘em coming. Don’t sit and wait for people to push your music for you. Have you ever used promotional tools like Submithub? They can be great BUT you will soon realize that many “influencers” are like bands themselves. They got a bunch of traffic one day 6 years ago off some Dreampop song and they’ve been looking for identical songs ever since. They are trying to recapture that attention again for themselves. They will all tell you they are looking for “innovative” tracks (they’re not) and if they use they word “atmosphere” they want songs drenched in reverb with the same production aesthetics found on pitchfork.com circa 2012. Actually that style hasn’t really ever gone away because it’s the last time anyway paid any attention to online music blogs. If you have your own style, a unique voice or write songs in odd time signatures etc. just release, release, release. The casual music fan I still believe is still looking for something new. “New” does not come from the “music business.” In fact Nashville is called the recording capital of the world and have you heard anything in the last 30 years that doesn’t sound like the debut album from an American Idol contestant? They are no different. Put yourself out there, make things that you don’t here other people making and don’t stop. Also avoid “Production Advice.” Learning production is really just learning to make something that’s been done so many times that it has become like math. When someone says “your production needs work.” Does it? Or did you just make something they have no reference for? You might be on the right track and could get discouraged buy a nobody who has never made music of their own because they are terrified that it wont be any good. They would rather be an expert that never has to prove himself. Example: one of the most popular YouTube channels for songwriting advice is Rick Beato. A guy who has literally made nothing interesting ever and he’s like 60. If somebody claims to know how to do it, they wouldn’t have a YouTube channel. They’d be a famous producer. As a music fan myself, I want to hear new music by artists who don’t give a fuck what the music business thinks. Do you want to make art? Or do you want to be famous? They are very different things. When I release music I always have the same feeling… “Wait till someone hears this! Nobody can beat that, nobody.” If you feel that way about your music (as you absolutely should,) you will quickly realize this “music business” is an embarrassing joke.",1,1.0,/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/15tuqsj/what_do_you_think_the_biggest_mistake_newer/jxfw194/,"Take this from my own 15 years of releasing music, playing in a million bands, etc. and feel free to trash me if you think I am wrong.

""using a platform that is essentially payola"" - Spotify strictly prohibits payola and removes any playlists that accept payments for playlist placement, the submission fee is for the time spent considering a track.

jv8hftk,1691454436.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,skihikerun,"u/BiscottiGeneral \- Use the free website [https://www.artist.tools/](https://www.artist.tools/) to check if your track got placed into any botted playlist. I am always doubtful of sketchy playlist campaigns. I've used submithub for pitching my tracks to playlist but only after researching the playlist on [artist.tools](https://artist.tools) and similar websites to see the follower count, engagement and if there non-bot active listeners.

For dollar to dollar, running your own ADs on Instagram is the best ROI from my past 2 years of experience. Your own Ads can control which user base to target, fans of similar artist and you can make them land on your own playlist where you can curate a nice selection of tracks with your own tracks mixed in the list. If people are willing to see an Ad on Insta with your music playing in the Ad, and click on the link to eventually land on Spotify, they obviously liked your style of music.

Hot or Not is genre based so while it’s easy to say someone just doesn’t like my genre it’s more a cop out than truth. Pick your genre and you’ll be fine. But do make sure to use the highest number of reviews. 1-10 bad reviews means nothing. But 50 below average reviews is a trend. 

Never pay to playlist. You are correct. What you did will not help you. Submithub is not pay to play. That’s why people dislike it so much. They get rejected because it’s pay to Listen which is vey different. You’re paying the blog or playlist for their time to listen. So it makes the playlists legit instead of a bunch of crap songs that listeners won’t want to hear it’s an actual curated list of indie artists that people who are into discovering music would be in to.

I am currently releasing my second song independently through distro kid. I pitched my song to spotify (haven't heard back) but also submitted it to submithub and got placed on 12 playlists. I did my own artwork.... basically most of the work you're describing.

ju2jlkq,1690723568.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,imaspaceheater,"There are “scenes” all around the internet. In fact I’d go as far to say as “local scenes” are all but useless when it comes to actually gaining fans. Band or solo artist your best bet is to link up with people online that you find on SoundCloud or through Spotify fans also like. The internet is your absolute strongest tool. Instead of putting all your energy into shows and local people put your energy into creating a discography, learning the ins and outs of Spotify and distributors and making the quality of your songs even better. You 100% do not have to “get lucky” with a viral song or whatever. Spotify has made it much easier to build and maintain a fanbase for smaller artists these days. They’ve added songs of mine to editorial playlists that have translated to fans, Spotify radio goes absolutely mad once you get some algorithms built up, you can pitch your songs to have increased chances of getting an editorial AND the song will go into a release radar that crams it to all your fans. It’s really a great time to be trying to make a name for yourself and I really hate seeing talented people waste their time chasing the “local scene” because often times those people are not receptive or willing to give new guys a chance. I mean I guess if your goal is literally that you just wanna play shows and pop around to all the little dive bars and just have a good time playing shows then sure by all means for for it. This isn’t what’s gonna translate to steams online though, can almost guarantee it. 

Your absolute best bet these days would be something like this. 
1. Get a nice vault of songs built up with decent quality mix and bring something new to the table with your sound. 
2. Start posting those songs on SoundCloud on Wednesday and schedule them for Friday on all other platforms. Put the Spotify pre-save and then the Spotify link (once it’s out) in the description of the song and make sure you utilize proper SoundCloud tags. 
3. Drop songs about every 2-3 weeks as long as you can manage ensuring that you pitch them to Spotify at least 1 week out. SoundCloud loves consistent drops and will push you hard once the algo recognizes this. Spotify is moving towards this as well with them recently making the recommended time to pitch only “at least 1 week”. 
4. Submit your songs to legit promotional YouTube channels. They seem to exist for all genres and you need to find ones that seem to have a real fanbase of people finding music from that platform. A lot of these channels will also have playlists tied to their Spotify. I will acknowledge this part is much harder as a “band” because there’s s lot more of this type of stuff for solo artists. For bands I might suggest something more like submithub and other legit playlist submission services. Starting out this will be the biggest challenge, linking up with some people to get your music heard. ALSO MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT GET TIED UP WITH ANY FAKE IR BOTTED PROMO THIS WILL RUIN YOUR ALGORITHMS FOR A LONG TIME IF YOU ARE SMALL. 
5. Link up with artists that you see pop up into your fans also like. Undoubtedly most of them will be a part of an online scene and probably make songs together/play shows together from time to time. 
6. Make sure you talk to people who show interest in your songs. This is important. I have people who still message me who listened to my songs when I was just starting out 3 years ago, they’ve been here the whole time listening and sharing my songs. Make connections with these people and you will have fans for life. Those small groups of fans help so much when you’re starting out because you need a place to start and small bit of consistency when you drop. When someone shows interest make sure and just at least message them back or respond to their SoundCloud comment etc. let them know you’re a human and just someone who enjoys making music. 
7. Be authentic. Just be yourself. Don’t have an online person unless it’s part of an act or something. 

This is all from my own experiences. I’ve known and worked with tons of artists and bands from all over the world in the past few years and everyone seems to agree that local scenes are kinds useless these days. I know many people who quit being in a band to pursue it solo once they realized how different things are these days. Your time is much better spent perfecting your craft and promoting online and connecting with people online. 

All that being said if you happen to find a nice scene of people who are playing shows and finding some good success the by all means take part. This isn’t meant to be taking a dig at local scenes or anything like that. It’s just, think about how many “local bands” you’ve seen over the years. I bet most if not all of them you’ve know never made it anywhere. There’s so so so much more to it these days than just showing up and playing shows. In fact as weird as it might sound, playing shows might be the last thing you should worry about, at least early on. 

Anyways I hope this comment at least helps someone out. It’s a huge struggle early on and it’s not easy go get yourself into a position where people are consistently listening but you definitely can do it given some patience and honest hard work.

edit: just wanted to add; everyone's experiences are different and different things might work for some people/bands and not for others. This is all a collection of some of the best advice I can give as someone whos built up a solid fanbase and several million song streams in the past 2 1/2 - 3 years.",133,133.0,/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/15de0yb/you_have_very_slim_chance_of_your_music_being/ju2jlkq/,"There are “scenes” all around the internet. In fact I’d go as far to say as “local scenes” are all but useless when it comes to actually gaining fans. Band or solo artist your best bet is to link up with people online that you find on SoundCloud or through Spotify fans also like. The internet is your absolute strongest tool. Instead of putting all your energy into shows and local people put your energy into creating a discography, learning the ins and outs of Spotify and distributors and making the quality of your songs even better. You 100% do not have to “get lucky” with a viral song or whatever. Spotify has made it much easier to build and maintain a fanbase for smaller artists these days. They’ve added songs of mine to editorial playlists that have translated to fans, Spotify radio goes absolutely mad once you get some algorithms built up, you can pitch your songs to have increased chances of getting an editorial AND the song will go into a release radar that crams it to all your fans. It’s really a great time to be trying to make a name for yourself and I really hate seeing talented people waste their time chasing the “local scene” because often times those people are not receptive or willing to give new guys a chance. I mean I guess if your goal is literally that you just wanna play shows and pop around to all the little dive bars and just have a good time playing shows then sure by all means for for it. This isn’t what’s gonna translate to steams online though, can almost guarantee it.  Your absolute best bet these days would be something like this.  1. Get a nice vault of songs built up with decent quality mix and bring something new to the table with your sound.  2. Start posting those songs on SoundCloud on Wednesday and schedule them for Friday on all other platforms. Put the Spotify pre-save and then the Spotify link (once it’s out) in the description of the song and make sure you utilize proper SoundCloud tags.  3. Drop songs about every 2-3 weeks as long as you can manage ensuring that you pitch them to Spotify at least 1 week out. SoundCloud loves consistent drops and will push you hard once the algo recognizes this. Spotify is moving towards this as well with them recently making the recommended time to pitch only “at least 1 week”.  4. Submit your songs to legit promotional YouTube channels. They seem to exist for all genres and you need to find ones that seem to have a real fanbase of people finding music from that platform. A lot of these channels will also have playlists tied to their Spotify. I will acknowledge this part is much harder as a “band” because there’s s lot more of this type of stuff for solo artists. For bands I might suggest something more like submithub and other legit playlist submission services. Starting out this will be the biggest challenge, linking up with some people to get your music heard. ALSO MAKE SURE YOU DO NOT GET TIED UP WITH ANY FAKE IR BOTTED PROMO THIS WILL RUIN YOUR ALGORITHMS FOR A LONG TIME IF YOU ARE SMALL.  5. Link up with artists that you see pop up into your fans also like. Undoubtedly most of them will be a part of an online scene and probably make songs together/play shows together from time to time.  6. Make sure you talk to people who show interest in your songs. This is important. I have people who still message me who listened to my songs when I was just starting out 3 years ago, they’ve been here the whole time listening and sharing my songs. Make connections with these people and you will have fans for life. Those small groups of fans help so much when you’re starting out because you need a place to start and small bit of consistency when you drop. When someone shows interest make sure and just at least message them back or respond to their SoundCloud comment etc. let them know you’re a human and just someone who enjoys making music.  7. Be authentic. Just be yourself. Don’t have an online person unless it’s part of an act or something.  This is all from my own experiences. I’ve known and worked with tons of artists and bands from all over the world in the past few years and everyone seems to agree that local scenes are kinds useless these days. I know many people who quit being in a band to pursue it solo once they realized how different things are these days. Your time is much better spent perfecting your craft and promoting online and connecting with people online.

I can't imagine this isn't a total rip-off. They've got to be making money somehow and I'd wager it's grafted from each transaction coordinated through that site. Or maybe the pros are paying the advertise there and it stands to reason that they'd pass the cost onto you. And if the artist is paying then they're a straight up chump. 

Find an album you like. Check out the names of the people who worked on it. Google them. They almost certainly have a website with an email address or a phone number. Tell them what your project is and they *will* get back to you. Because if they don't then someone else will. 

The weird thing is that THIS IS A CORNER OF THE MUSIC INDUSTRY THAT DOES NOT NEED THIS SHIT. Recording/mixing/mastering engineers and musicians are all skilled and they have bodies of work that speak for themselves. They also have to hustle day to day just like anyone else. They need to take your call. SoundBetter isn't breaking down some barrier or flattening out the playing field. 

The world of A&amp;R, promo and marketing is just the reverse. You can't make a good record by just having the right friends but you can leverage connections to get something into print. Most music journalism is total garbage; I've seen plenty of Brooklyn Vegan articles that are obvious press kit copypasta. So when I see a website like SubmitHub it's like... horses for courses. 

&gt;To me, there's no better networking than going to shows, talking to artists, and having a decent web/social presence with some solid work examples to give you some legitimacy.

Most of my clients are one degree of separation away from me and just hit me up. In the past year, I've met two label heads, one guy who runs a pressing plant, like thirty new players... and I'm a fairly quiet introvert when you get to know me. 

So when someone hits me up cold through social media and they don't know ANYBODY who is more than two degrees of separation away and they don' tell me which records of mine that they like then I figure it's spam.

jsn8p42,1689801924.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,marklonesome,"I'm by no means an expert but the research I've done may help you.

**Playlist placement**

There's a ton of ways of doing this from submitting directly to Spotify editorial lists, by paying to get them placed with sites like submithub or Moonstrive or by simply finding people who have good playlists and flat out asking them to put your songs on it.

From my experience this will get you some listens and some saves (to their playlists) but it only counts for the song you get placed. For example I got over 1200 streams on one song from about 5 playlists and that amounted to being added to about 100 individuals playlists. So if that holds true you're at about 12%. Doesn't seem like they listened to any other songs on my Spotify and if so not to any meaningful amount.

The benefit of this is, if you choose the right placement, your music will be heard and won't be sitting in the dark languishing in obscurity. Are the listeners super engaged? Probably not. They may have heard you song sandwiched between Billy Eilish and Taylor Swift...but they heard it and if they added it to their playlist or saved it... they liked it. That means a lot to me and all I care about. The bad part of this is that it will likely cost you and you're not really getting a true fan out of it. 

**Social Road**

You know what to do. 

Build up social media presence on TikTok, IG, FB, or likely all of them. You post interesting content, you spend time adding people who might be interested in hopes that add you back. You create engaging content. Long story short, you have to be a multi media agency in some ways. Music videos, pics, shit like that. You've seen enough of them to know what people want to see. If not, go check out your favorite artists socials... now do that.

Once you have the accounts and some content you create a landing page (google how to do it for music). This is simply a web page that you can use tracking on. All it does is link people to YT, Spotify or Apple Music... wherever you want to get your listens from.

Now you run ads from IG or FB to that page. You track the metrics and adjust. Retarget people and modify so that you're pitching the right stuff to the right audience. You are basically creating a business but instead of selling T-shirts or weight loss pills, you're selling your music. 

It's the same thing.

The same process.

The same funnels.   


Go search fitness supplements or something like that on FB and click on one of the ads. See what it does, that's what you have to do... more or less.

Grind that, and overtime you'll presumably build up enough of a following and fanbase to attract the attention of a label and/or be able to sell products to. Interact with them, have contests all the shit large acts do but on a smaller scale.

It's a grind, and it's 100% a job. If you get any success people will want to do it for you for free. Use them, pay them if you can. Rinse and repeat.

To me, it's very disheartening because writing and producing music is daunting enough (on top of everything we all have going on in our personal lives) so the thought of having to also be a marketing and social media expert is disappointing especially since I absolutely fucking loathe social media and everything about it. 

BUT if you learn it and grind it it can work... and it is the landscape as of this writing.

Now inevitably someone will reply with ""My friends cousin's pet goose doesn't do any of that and he gets 1 billion streams an hour on Spotify so you're full of shit""

So...None of this is to say you can't write an absolutely banger of a tune. The bust out hit of the summer of 2023..., put it on TikTiok or YT and get 1 trillion views over night. That can happen... or some variation of it.

But that's the equivalent of winning the lottery... or at the very least that one friend you heard about who graduated from college and applied for a job and got offered CEO position for $300K a year with Natalie Portman lookalike as his assistant. Sure it happens but not to anyone I know.

There's a guy who is pretty active on these boards, his name is Jesse David Lacey and he's very knowledgable about this shit. He's also a musician who has been through it himself. 

He sells a service where he does or at least helps you set up all of this. He also posts a lot of content and helpful shit so look him up. There's another guy as well who does that stuff but IDK him. I've spoken to Jesse and he seems legit and very nice.

If you're serious I'd suggest you find him and have a call to discuss if he can help you guys out.

If you do nothing you will be placing a single book into a library. 

The chances of someone stumbling upon your songs on spotify are about as good as someone finding that random book among all the stacks on all the floors of a city library... it's not good. 

Your music will get exactly the number of streams that you and your family/friends are able to give it.

That's one area I haven't really experimented with much until now. I've created a couple spotify playlists with mostly my production, and I'm working on getting people to save/follow them. I've never ran ads on social media but from what you described it seems like it can be cost effective. What I do is just pin a playlist to my Artist Pick and it picks up a few follows per day. My long-term goal is to get a few playlists with thousands of followers and then monetize them by becoming a playlist curator for PlaylistPush/SubmitHub/etc. As for your specific questions:

(1) I stuck with PlaylistPush just because that's the one I tried first based on reviews, and their playlists seem to be pretty high quality overall - no botted streams. I've made accounts with SubmitHub and SoundCamps but just never committed $$ to them. SoundCamps seemed like I was spending a LOT more to pitch to fewer playlists compared to PP.

(2) I kinda mix what I shop to rappers vs my self-published discography. Most of the stuff I shop for major label placements I keep off Spotify. I haven't run into any pitfalls as far as distributing the same beats that I shop to artists, BUT that's because I also don't use Content ID on anything. I deliberately keep everything out of Google/Meta Content ID because then everyone who uses a beat will start getting copyright strikes on YT/FB/IG etc. One of the main things that helped my beats go viral was YouTubers using my beats off SoundCloud in their videos. I allow all my beats to be downloaded for free and used with credit. I probably wouldn't be where I am today if I didn't have my whole catalog basically free on SoundCloud. When I sell a beat to a local/indie artist what they're essentially paying for is the extended HQ beat + stems.

(3) I think building playlists of your music is a great idea, as I discussed before, that's something I am working on. People tend to have short attention spans and usually can't be bothered to click through your discography and explore all of your releases in-depth. So putting your music in a more digestible format like a playlist I think would definitely improve your engagement and algorithmic scores.

My top-performing tracks on Spotify have popularity scores around 50%. In the last year or so, I've noticed a positive feedback loop occurring where my songs are heavily recommended to users in algorithmic playlists (mainly Radio), then they like/share/playlist the song, which causes the rank to go higher, which causes more engagement, etc. So I think I've finally got the sweet spot of Spotify popularity where the algorithm is recommending me to basically anyone listening to instrumental hip hop.

This is really insightful hearing your budget, number of playlists, size of playlists, what you were targeting and how that worked in your successful early campaign. My wife and I have been really trying to dive into music marketing these past few months, trying to set up the momentum to hit algorithmic pushes on Spotify regularly.   


I have a few follow up questions you have time for em. And no worries at all if not.  


1) Have you tried other playlisting services such as SubmitHub / is there any particular reason why you use PlaylistPush?   


2) Do you distribute beats that you also sell or do you keep your discography separate from what you shop by rappers? Do you see any potential pitfalls for distributing beats for instrumental listening while also selling licensing on them to rappers?  


3) Do you think consistent algorithmic push could be achieved through investing in building deep playlists of only your music? I suppose successful examples of this would be Lofi Girl or organizations like ChillHop Music, Fantastic FM, and JazzHop Cafe. Do you see any pros or cons to chasing that sort of advertising model?  


I know these are kinda specific questions but I'd be very curious to hear your perspective. I have 295 beats distributed on platforms right now. I am also selling licenses to all of them on BeatStars. I really don't see many producers doing that, and so I'm curious if I am somehow shooting myself in the foot by also offering artists an accessible way to obtain permissions to these beats which they may be hearing on my Spotify.   


As you may have guessed, we are chasing a bit of a Lofi Girl, ChillHop Music, etc., type model where we are investing in Instagram ads (via facebook ad manager), and growing instrumental playlists which only contain my productions and collabs. We have been running very small campaigns ($100-$250) for the past 3 &amp;1/2 months. Through these ads, we've managed to find a few tracks that are getting pretty damn good costs per conversion (at least I think so, compared to all of the numbers in the tutorials we've been watching). Our most popular playlist is our ""Jazzy HipHop"" playlist which has gotten over 1000 saves with about $250-$350ish spent in advertising for it. I've currently got 1800 monthlies and we haven't hit any significant algorithmic push yet, though I'm hoping to make that leap soon. I've hit a a decent release radar push in the past without any advertising. Now, with some new releases that came out during the start of this last campaign, I've now got a few tracks approaching a spotify popularity score of about 20%. I predict that we might be able to hit a push with one or two more campaigns if we really go for it on the right releases with the right playlist. Guess we'll see.

Submithub is pretty good, it's not that expensive and even a few playlists can boost a lot. The feedbacks are very good, because it also helps to improve your production skills. 
Tiktok and Youtube are the one in free promotion. Facebook and instagram are okay, but it is really hard to grow on them I think.

Soundcloud is not that bad, I see a lot of potential in it. Actually the subscription is not that expensive.

Little advices, 
don’t just send to them the song, pay 2x the price BUT in the condition put create a challenge with an hashtag, it’s hard and could be difficult but if someone video get viral enough, you got a jackpot. 

Advices number 2; 
Check their engagement before sending it, if they have less than 1-10 likes and few comments skip them

For example;
80k views 10k likes 1/8 is good
80k views 2k likes 1/40 is a waste of money

If you have limited budget study all of these things

Best challenges you can aim from my experience;
Game challenges;

Genshin impact - create a challenge with this song where you defeat X/speedrun/edit something

Only Up - the game of the moment, speedruns

Minecraft - always good game

Valorant - use this song while you do something special

Not game related; 

Dancing
Lip syncing 
Filter usage

jpjtmrm,1687752501.0,trapproduction,AndrewSouthworth,"Here's a quick blueprint for music promotion:

1. Social media content
2. Paid social ads
3. Curator marketing

1. Social media - aim for creating 40-60 short form video clips for each song. This if very often not that time intensive, just performing the song in a cool place and chopping it into pieces...

2. Paid ads - If you had $1,000 put $900 into Facebook (Meta) ads and $100 into YouTube ads. TikTok / Snapchat ads also work, but they're more expensive than Facebook ads per result. Focus on conversion campaigns driving people directly to Spotify from a landing page.

3. Curator marketing - If you're in a genre that fits cleanly into a box, reach out to playlists / blogs / YouTube channels to share your song.   
This could be either done through email, or through platforms like SubmitHub and Groover. This could also include 3rd party playlisting companies, but just remember its hard to tell who is a good vs bad actor in this space. Budget-wise keep this much smaller than your ads.

I'm a big fan of the ads, but of course they require a budget. Additionally there is a learning curve with them if you've never done them before. But with them i've driven hundreds of millions of streams. 

Every Monday I send out a free [newsletter](https://www.musicmarketingmonday.com/subscribe) with actionable music marketing advice if that's your kind of thing. I also have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/andrewsouthworth) channel dedicated to music marketing.",1,1.0,/r/trapproduction/comments/14gr1bw/best_ways_to_promote_music/jpjtmrm/,"Here's a quick blueprint for music promotion 1.

From my albeit limited research you have a few legit ways.

1. Submitting to playlists which you can do through Spotify or with sites like Submithub or Groover. This costs money once you're out of Spotify.
2. Running ads on a social platforms and driving people to your music (also costs money).
3. Playing live and hoping people are able / interested in finding and following you.
4. Using an existing or newly created social media platform to get friends/followers.

Without work and/or money IDK of any way to get significant followers. If you have no social following and you aren't able to produce high engagement content in the form of TikTok videos that people WANT to watch then you're best bet is playlist submissions.

jocye8k,1686928549.0,musicproduction,shitgoessouth,"I would just start with getting a DAW and trying it out. There’s a lot more to making music, being a musician, producer, etc than simply being artistic and wanting to make something out of it. You’re really glorifying the life of a professional musician/producer. It’s still very much a real job and grind for the vast majority.

jo5mfqt,1686779996.0,ambientmusic,jrobthehuman,"&gt;How can I spread awareness of my music without seeming like a shameless self-promoter?

The short answer is: spread awareness of your music without being a shameless self-promoter.

The longer answer is that no one gets found in a vacuum. And most people don't respond to unsolicited links that says ""maybe listen to my music?""

You could go through traditional PR routes by sending your music to publications and playlist curators—maybe trying something like submithub.

There are plenty of groups of ambient artists in communities on reddit, twitter and twitch, just name a few. But, if your stance is that you don't want to listen to anyone else's work, that's not really an encouraging approach to get anyone to listen to yours.

My suggestion to any artist is to stop thinking about ""networking"" and think about building community. Networking feels so transactional, which is not what this is about.

jo2rqr0,1686725408.0,musicmarketing,TheSlowMusicMovement,"I know I won't get any sympathy and that's fine but being a curator is really tricky. I receive a ton of great tracks that artists submit without obviously taking the time to flip through my playlists, read my blog or listen to the radio show, someting I totally understand, as time is an issue, especially if you are submitting to many curators. So my feedback can often be complimentary with a refusal at the end, due to suitability. Often the quality is great but it's a bit too commercial, sometimes a track is great but the vocal is a bit too generic. It doesn't mean that I don't appreciate the music, but I have to give a reason for refusal. Sometimes it's quite hard to quantify, it's just a vibe or feel, and then I'm trying to do this without offending the artist. It's quite a tricky thing to do when you are dealing with 400-600 submissions a month in my case, with many of the tracks being pretty poor quality. If you are bored then go through your Release Radar sometime, and write a yes or no+a reason why for each one, then multiply that by three. There are a lot of curators that receive far more submissions than me and to be honest I'm not sure how they do it, listening to lots of bad/average/good music to find the great tunes is quite mentally demanding. 

On top of that I follow 160 blogs, check the weekly release lists from several record shops, follow social media for tips, folllow 3500 artists, labels and fans on Bandcamp, 100s on Soundcloud and that's before all the 100s of weekly emails from artists, labels and PR companies that I receive. The competition is fierce so even if a track is good or great it's not always going to make the cut if there are a few better tracks. I can't lie mood also plays a part, sometimes I just want a vibe.

Don't forget as well that not all of the curators are English so translation might be an issue. Not all the curators might be well educated so expression or linguistic subtety/accuracy might be an issue? Maybe the curator is having a hard week - the dog died, they are sick, tired, there could be a million reasons the feedback isn't perfect.

Lastly as an artist I would say don't take it personally. Online communication/text messaging between people with no personal contact is open to a lot of interpretation and quite often an artists reaction is more about frustration about lack of success or recognition, often after years of practise or grinding, life is hard and rejection always hurts. As a label I deal with feedback that hurts as I want the tracks to be successful for my artists, for whom I feel a lot of responsibility, so I don't actually read most of it, apart from a few curators that I feel are more key to a tracks success and who I know whose judgement - bad or good, I can trust and respect. Then if it's a refusal I just shrug my shoulders and carry on hustling.

Submithub and Groover are actually quite unique in that you get feedback on a track, which makes them easy targets for artistic frustration. I send out hundreds of emails for each release to blogs, magazine, curators, tastemakers, playlisters, podcasters and radio stations and my response rate with feedback is probably around 1% and I often miss radio plays or it takes me a while to realise there is some coverage.

The modern music landscape is ridiculously tough to crack, the industry is hard to navigate and there has never been more competition - cover all bases, don't take it personally and keep grinding - that's often the main difference between those that make it and those that don't, dealing with 10 years of rejection before coming an ""overnight success.""",3,3.0,/r/musicmarketing/comments/1485gxa/submit_hub_for_genre_blending/jo2rqr0/,"I know I won't get any sympathy and that's fine but being a curator is really tricky.

We have tried numerous things to promote what I am confident is an above average rock album and a lot of things just didn't have much of a return.

Submithub and similar can get solid feedback and put you on a few good playlists. But it seems like the reality is: most of these bigger playlist curators don't really just stick randoms on their lists so easily. If your song or album is a real banger you'll get generic ""this is good"" write-ups on websites with some, but not a lot of, traffic. It helps but it also costs money.

The other thing is like fb/insta/TikTok kinda advertising. This seems useful in targeting people but it's kind of annoying to be advertised as a band you've never heard of. Skipped just like the ad for the doorbell or whatever.

Then people always say play to your audience and your scene. Sure. My scene is definitely okay but it's not gonna break us. And it seems more and more true each passing year: people in your scene sure do care about your art a lot more when people OUTSIDE of it care too.

So it just seems kind of like you're spinning your wheels a lot of the time. Or worse throwing around a little bit of money so your monthly listeners count goes up slightly.

I've even tried jumping in the DMs of specific journalists that wrote for music magazines. I was thinking hey maybe if this person who writes cares about the song or the album, maybe they'll write about it and we can snowball some fans off that. Meh. I've had a couple replies but nothing of note. It's almost like you need a label or a connection to reach most of those people. More money writing about Taylor swift or whatever established act's newest release. Not a lot of people want to read words about music they've never heard. So what motivation would these people even have to feature us or care about us?

At the end of the day, we figure we will just keep doing our thing and keep writing our songs.

The release of a full albums worth of material when you had very very little footprint on the internet and only maybe 4 dozen fans seems like a mistake to us now. That said, I think we all wanted to be able to say ""we made a rock LP"" so it's even. Going forward I think we've decided to just put out singles once every 4-8 weeks until we get bored of it....or until someone pays us.

Other than that, it's play gigs - writes songs and grind. Hope someone notices. I try to remind myself that if just that one right person here's us and goes ""this rules"" everything could change for us.....until then just keep doing it.

jk8kgpr,1684158361.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,VideoGameDJ,"Hi there, I’m a producer and label owner with 15 years experience. My advice hasn’t gotten a lot of traction on this sub lately because it doesn’t agree with the  hive mind. But since you explicitly asked for someone like me, here’s my nuts and bolts advice

Upload new music consistently, with new songs every 1 to 6 weeks.

Focus primary on one platform - YouTube if you can make videos, Spotify if you can’t

Social media is a bonus, not a requirement. Spend 90% of your time on music, 10% on socials. (Or 0%, socials don’t matter if your music is good because other creators will use it)

Format is critical with music. Long intros kill performance. Short tracks win. Say what you have to say and don’t overstay your welcome.

For indie artists, Instrumentals get more traction than music with vocals. In my catalog, it’s 10 to 1 in terms of streams favoring instros 

Networking is only useful if you have something to offer. Building followers does not increase streaming revenue directly.

Find playlist curators and ask politely for placements. Only ask if your music fits the playlists. Prepare for only 1 in 100 to respond. Many will listen, few will add. SubmitHub is decent, Instagram DMs work good and are free.

Streaming makes more money than touring and merch tenfold. I toured for 7 years. I make more in two months from Spotify then I did in 2 years of playing shows. Playing shows is a great way to make new fans, it is not a great way to make money.

Paying attention to what music is popular and curtailing your style is a skill. It takes time. If you can do it, it will be a boon. If you can’t, produce long enough and what you make may become popular on its own. (That’s what happened to me.)

Good luck and Godspeed.",52,52.0,/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/13i6fe0/a_decent_overview_of_money_in_the_music_industry/jk8kgpr/,"Hi there, I’m a producer and label owner with 15 years experience.

You could definitely improve your monthly listener count by getting some tracks on Spotify playlists. I’ve had good luck with Submithub, but i bet you could also reach out to playlist curators through instagram.

Youtube channel premieres are another great source of getting listeners. 

Send promos out to DJs. Can be a crapshoot, obviously much better chance of getting them to listen to your track if you’ve connected IRL.

Small labels i’ve found pretty useless. They don’t get me promo I couldn’t just do on my own. YMMV. I probably won’t do more labels releases unless they press to vinyl or they’re big enough that i KNOW they really work their releases.

Release tracks regularly. Go out as often as you can to meet people and expand your network. Work your tracks as hard as you can through instagram, spotify, bandcamp, and youtube.

If you’re talking about releasing as in commercially releasing here’s my take: There are a million “record labels” out there who will sign you just so they can scalp a few cents from your streams (if you get any, and the contract will be written so you get as minimal percentage as possible) and they’ll do this for a thousand other artists. The label doesn’t mind, they have 2,000 releases earning a couple of bucks every quarter, it’s easy money for them - if you go this way, you’ll be drowned out in all the noise and be “just another release on that shitty label” 

Instead, just have a look at the artists you listen to and enjoy / aspire to be like. Who got you inspired to start making music? What label are they on? Does that label have a tight-knit family, like Size Records or even OWSLA? Are their releases consistently top quality? Are they investing in their releases, with music videos? Are their artists successful? These are the places you want to sign your music to. 

Don’t sign your music away to a shitty label just for the sake of having a “signed release”. You’ll be discarded and lost like single-use plastic. Its not what we work our asses off as producers for. It is much, much more likely that you can grow your career by releasing music for free (free downloads on SoundCloud etc.) first to grow your own fan base and following, who are going to stick around with you for the foreseeable. 

As you grow and your production quality naturally reaches a higher level (which has come from experience), that’s when people like A&amp;Rs, talent scouts etc.) will start to notice you and reach out. You’ll be picked up by the right places then, because your music will be speaking for itself. And they will also be paying attention to your followers, it’s always nice having the sway of your own audience to bring with you.

In the meantime, you can use websites like LabelRadar and SubmitHub to throw dollars at the networking industry (“Pay $10 to send your song to this Spotify Playlister!”) to try and get your poor-sounding music signed or reposted somewhere - but if you’re not convinced that your music is good enough yet, they certainly won’t be either - but will be more than happy to snatch your money for the privilege of giving you a big fat “No.”  
 It’s a good way to gauge wether you’ve hit that release-level quality though. 

It’s also worth noting that you will never feel like your quality is good enough, it’s just human nature :) Best of luck

It’s also worth noting that you will never feel like your quality is good enough, it’s just human nature ) Best of luck  Drop some links of your music so we can listen!","tldr wait until quality is good before releasing commercially, don’t be tempted to sign music to shitty labels just because you can do it in the meantime, giving away for free first is the best way to grow organically  if you’re talking about releasing as in commercially releasing here’s my take there are a million “record labels” out there who will sign you just so they can scalp a few cents from your streams (if you get any, and the contract will be written so you get as minimal percentage as possible) and they’ll do this for a thousand other artists. the label doesn’t mind, they have 2,000 releases earning a couple of bucks every quarter, it’s easy money for them - if you go this way, you’ll be drowned out in all the noise and be “just another release on that shitty label”  instead, just have a look at the artists you listen to and enjoy / aspire to be like. who got you inspired to start making music? what label are they on? does that label have a tight-knit family, like size records or even owsla? are their releases consistently top quality? are they investing in their releases, with music videos? are their artists successful? these are the places you want to sign your music to.  don’t sign your music away to a shitty label just for the sake of having a “signed release”. you’ll be discarded and lost like single-use plastic. its not what we work our asses off as producers for. it is much, much more likely that you can grow your career by releasing music for free (free downloads on soundcloud etc.) first to grow your own fan base and following, who are going to stick around with you for the foreseeable.  as you grow and your production quality naturally reaches a higher level (which has come from experience), that’s when people like a&rs, talent scouts etc.) will start to notice you and reach out. you’ll be picked up by the right places then, because your music will be speaking for itself. and they will also be paying attention to your followers, it’s always nice having the sway of your own audience to bring with you. in the meantime, you can use websites like labelradar and submithub to throw dollars at the networking industry (“pay $10 to send your song to this spotify playlister!”) to try and get your poor-sounding music signed or reposted somewhere - but if you’re not convinced that your music is good enough yet, they certainly won’t be either - but will be more than happy to snatch your money for the privilege of giving you a big fat “no.”    it’s a good way to gauge wether you’ve hit that release-level quality though.  it’s also worth noting that you will never feel like your quality is good enough, it’s just human nature ) best of luck  drop some links of your music so we can listen!",495,False,False

ji3arwq,1682709034.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,itsSomethingCool,"You need to have a marketing mindset. I have pop songs I’ve released in the past that I cringe at nowadays but due to very strong marketing, have over millions of streams.

1) Submithub sucks. Use whatever you would’ve spent on this hoping you get put on a playlist on ads. 

2) Playlist pitching is meh. Unless you’re song is really good, it’ll be drowned out in the 100s of e-mails the curators get daily. If you have an established relationship with the curator, this is a great method, but if you’re just cold-pitching, you’re better off spending that time elsewhere.

3) Paid Social Ads are my favorite. You can get right in front of the exact kind of fan you’re looking for. You need a compelling ad video &amp; copy as well that entices someone to want to click on your song. A great music video or some stock footage for example works great. People don’t want to just see a static photo ad, it’s boring, you need visuals. A +$3 CPC is very bad for promoting music. Either your ads are very boring, or you aren’t targeting the correct audience, or the song frankly just isn’t resonating with people. Think of it as creating a commercial for your music. Put your business hat on and pretend like you’re marketing a product. You can have one of the best Pop songs out right now, but if your marketing is bad, nobody will randomly find it just because it’s good. This came easy to me because I work in marketing and online advertising for major companies and get to see how it works on a large scale.

4) PR &amp; Radio are outdated to an extent imo. Doesn’t hurt to reach out to them for blog placements, but most of my PR and radio play have come from people just finding my music, and not me reaching out or cold-pitching. If you hire a PR company with connections, this would be great, but unless you just want to look more credible, I feel like the money spent here would be better spent on ads.

5) Tiktok can be great if you utilize it properly. Your goal should be to get fans OFF of the app onto streaming platforms. It’s wild to me when I see bands/artists with 500k+ followers on Tiktok but 300 monthly listeners on Spotify. At that point you’re just a social media influencer more than an artist. It can be great though, look at Greta Van Fleet for example. 


If your goal is to get as many streams as possible, I’d focus on extremely compelling ads and Tiktok content. Don’t make those generic “hi guys! Stream my song please!” Vids either, they’re corny, uninspired, unoriginal and don’t help you stand out at all. Be creative! Creativity will get you very far. This is how you build fans.

People who want to see you in real life on tour, not just people who stream your song once or twice then forget who you are.","you need to have a marketing mindset. i have pop songs i’ve released in the past that i cringe at nowadays but due to very strong marketing, have over millions of streams. 1) submithub sucks. use whatever you would’ve spent on this hoping you get put on a playlist on ads.  2) playlist pitching is meh. unless you’re song is really good, it’ll be drowned out in the 100s of e-mails the curators get daily. if you have an established relationship with the curator, this is a great method, but if you’re just cold-pitching, you’re better off spending that time elsewhere. 3) paid social ads are my favorite. you can get right in front of the exact kind of fan you’re looking for. you need a compelling ad video & copy as well that entices someone to want to click on your song. a great music video or some stock footage for example works great. people don’t want to just see a static photo ad, it’s boring, you need visuals. a $3 cpc is very bad for promoting music. either your ads are very boring, or you aren’t targeting the correct audience, or the song frankly just isn’t resonating with people. think of it as creating a commercial for your music. put your business hat on and pretend like you’re marketing a product. you can have one of the best pop songs out right now, but if your marketing is bad, nobody will randomly find it just because it’s good. this came easy to me because i work in marketing and online advertising for major companies and get to see how it works on a large scale. 4) pr & radio are outdated to an extent imo. doesn’t hurt to reach out to them for blog placements, but most of my pr and radio play have come from people just finding my music, and not me reaching out or cold-pitching. if you hire a pr company with connections, this would be great, but unless you just want to look more credible, i feel like the money spent here would be better spent on ads. 5) tiktok can be great if you utilize it properly. your goal should be to get fans off of the app onto streaming platforms. it’s wild to me when i see bands/artists with 500k followers on tiktok but 300 monthly listeners on spotify. at that point you’re just a social media influencer more than an artist. it can be great though, look at greta van fleet for example.  if your goal is to get as many streams as possible, i’d focus on extremely compelling ads and tiktok content. don’t make those generic “hi guys! stream my song please!” vids either, they’re corny, uninspired, unoriginal and don’t help you stand out at all. be creative! creativity will get you very far. this is how you build fans. people who want to see you in real life on tour, not just people who stream your song once or twice then forget who you are.",506,False,False

IMO I think what's more effective than paying for something like submithub or any playlists in general is some good ol fashioned advertising, and perhaps advertising your own playlist if you can. I'm a producer, and my wife and I decided to make a ChillHop playlist of all of my ChillHop related works.

This is the second $100 campaign we're doing on this playlist. The first was a traffic campaign which did well, so we decided to learn how to do a conversion campaign and that seems to be doing even better.

We're about $60-$70 in on our ChillHop playlist campaign, and we've gotten about 100 more saves on my playlist so far. My playlist is about 50 tracks long and contains only my work. It's working pretty nicely. Nothing too crazy, but my cost per conversion is about $0.30

The best way is just to promote and increase the reach of your music is just to build with other people.

If you can do it in person, even better.

Form genuine relationships with other people.

Take a genuine interest in their music or whatever it is they do.

jgq9ev5,1681814872.0,musicproduction,tmxband,"Whenever someone asks this question I ask back: “Why do you think you can make it fully alone with your pocket money in the music industry(!)? I write it again: Industry. 

Industry VS pocket money (think about it, take your time)

Some are lucky but if you want to be lucky it’s the same as lottery. And some are lucky with income (parents money) etc.. for example when you watch online marketing strategies on yt and it’s not working for you it’s usually because those strategies involve way more money, parallel promotion, etc.. as you see the other answers here, everyone is saying that “you should gain more followers” and “reach radios” etc.. yeah, so these costs a LOT. 

As a label owner DJ and producer I give you a very honest answer:
You can’t make it alone, only if you have about $1000-2000 you can spend in every month for about 2 years only on your music career. And if you want to make it a faster than around $3000-4000 starting investment at the very beginning is somewhat necessary. 

Good news is that you can cut some of the expenses with talent and learning. If you can make your own mixing and mastering and you can make nice covers (I mean all of these in high quality and with artistic value) then the costs are less. But don’t expect more savings than that because many doors open only via agencies. You can send out a thousand email daily to DJs and radios but they mostly never open it. They open mails from trusted agencies and platforms. 

This is why you have to stop thinking about spending less because it will not work. The right approach is “earning more that i can spend” and this is why you have to do gigs, but not for coke and girls but to invest that money. And the bigger you get the higher your fee can be, it means more investment, etc, and at a point you can turn it over.

Or even have a manager / booker, etc.. but don’t be naive, these agents are not for charity, they make money on(!) you, not for you, so don’t expect anyone to work with you if you don’t have already a strong income from gigs / selling / royalties. 

Being in this industry needs a business approach, it’s the necessary evil. You can be naive or you can accept this. It is a lot of investment with a turnover only after years. And the shitty part is that if you quit before that your money is basically lost. If you quit for just 6 months or a year, your momentum is lost with your money. So it needs serious long time commitment and a stable income. 

Or if you don’t have that amount of money (most people don’t) for self funding you can cut some music promo costs by signing to a label who will hopefully do some promotion. But you still have to invest in artist promotion (yep, it’s two separate things). At a point cost are rising because you will have to involve PR and thats a third branch to pay. So you will have to figure out how to make money directly from your music career because if you don’t do it you will stuck, limited by spendable promo money. 

Usually the very first question should be this: “Is my music good enough to gamble that much money?” So before spending all your money, just test your music. Not silly ways like asking your friends about it or the clueless kids on Submithub but send it to tier 1 and tied 2 labels and hope for an answer. If you get no answer it means your music is not good enough. If they answer but reject you, your music is not good enough. This is how you test your music, not in online forums or on Reddit but with the actual industry. (You will learn a lot simply from the feedbacks or lack of feedbacks.)

What is a really important thing in this business is that time = money and quality = talent and/or money. For example you can spend 6 hours / day on social media to do everything manually but then you will not have time to make new music or do your regular job. So outsourcing tasks is basically buying time for yourself. When you will have an agent for PR or booking you again basically just buy time (with percentage you pay for them). But of course the very core of the whole thing is to have good music consistently, you can spend $400-500 on mixing / mastering but if it is just a shiny turd it’s not gonna work. And I’m saying this without knowing anything about you so don’t take this personally because it’s not about you or anyone, it’s just the harsh reality of music industry. So if you are making good music and labels give you a chance that’s a good indicator that you might have a future in it, just always be consistent.",1,1.0,/r/musicproduction/comments/12ptk65/after_production_and_release_you_want_to_promote/jgq9ev5/,"Whenever someone asks this question I ask back “Why do you think you can make it fully alone with your pocket money in the music industry(!)? I write it again Industry.  Industry VS pocket money (think about it, take your time) Some are lucky but if you want to be lucky it’s the same as lottery. And some are lucky with income (parents money) etc.. for example when you watch online marketing strategies on yt and it’s not working for you it’s usually because those strategies involve way more money, parallel promotion, etc.. as you see the other answers here, everyone is saying that “you should gain more followers” and “reach radios” etc.. yeah, so these costs a LOT.  As a label owner DJ and producer I give you a very honest answer You can’t make it alone, only if you have about $1000-2000 you can spend in every month for about 2 years only on your music career. And if you want to make it a faster than around $3000-4000 starting investment at the very beginning is somewhat necessary.  Good news is that you can cut some of the expenses with talent and learning. If you can make your own mixing and mastering and you can make nice covers (I mean all of these in high quality and with artistic value) then the costs are less. But don’t expect more savings than that because many doors open only via agencies. You can send out a thousand email daily to DJs and radios but they mostly never open it. They open mails from trusted agencies and platforms.  This is why you have to stop thinking about spending less because it will not work. The right approach is “earning more that i can spend” and this is why you have to do gigs, but not for coke and girls but to invest that money. And the bigger you get the higher your fee can be, it means more investment, etc, and at a point you can turn it over. Or even have a manager / booker, etc.. but don’t be naive, these agents are not for charity, they make money on(!) you, not for you, so don’t expect anyone to work with you if you don’t have already a strong income from gigs / selling / royalties.  Being in this industry needs a business approach, it’s the necessary evil. You can be naive or you can accept this. It is a lot of investment with a turnover only after years. And the shitty part is that if you quit before that your money is basically lost. If you quit for just 6 months or a year, your momentum is lost with your money. So it needs serious long time commitment and a stable income.  Or if you don’t have that amount of money (most people don’t) for self funding you can cut some music promo costs by signing to a label who will hopefully do some promotion. But you still have to invest in artist promotion (yep, it’s two separate things). At a point cost are rising because you will have to involve PR and thats a third branch to pay.

jggkhqv,1681633491.0,musicmarketing,Intelligent_Cut_7422,"After trying both services, I can conclude that SubmitHub is more efficient for independent musicians due to its features, while Groover boasts a more modern and clean user interface. Groover provides essential functionality, such as submitting your track to influencers and playlist curators. In contrast, SubmitHub allows you to communicate with other musicians, rate tracks, and add their tunes to your playlists (or vice versa, by submitting your track to Hot or Not and potentially getting listed on someone's Spotify playlist).  
Back in the 2000s and 2010s, musicians promoted their music through platforms like MySpace, SoundCloud (where group communication was prevalent), and other sites such as PromoDJ in the Russian internet. It seems to me that SubmitHub has recreated something similar by enabling musicians to exchange reviews and, at the same time, gain new listeners.  
Perhaps Groover's concept is different, aiming to provide an end-to-end solution for music promotion (you send your track and get promoted). However, this approach hasn't worked well for my music, at least with the budget I have.  
I will continue to experiment with these sites. As of now, my experience stands as follows: I submitted my track through both sites, sending about 20 messages to playlist curators on each platform.

1. Contact the curators and see if they like it, via Instagram Facebook TikTok etc

To reiterate though: as far as I can work out after releasing my own music for just over a year, your best chance of exposure is getting an album premiere hosted by either World Has Post Rock or Where Post Rock Dwells on YouTube. I think their contact details are on their channel ""about"" pages - get in touch, and keep trying if you don't get a response straight away.

Also submit to their Spotify playlists, and to those of Postrock Instrumental (the latter is on Submithub). There are others of course, but they seem to be the ones with the most followers (especially WHPR).

Release some singles ahead of the album and try to get each of them playlisted. Every individual release is an opportunity to find new listeners. I've done videos for my singles but couldn't honestly say they've made any difference - it doesn't actually help people find your music. It does open up the possibility of running them as ads on YouTube to try and get them in front of your target audience, which I've tried, but again I couldn't say it really got me anywhere.

In terms of a physical release, you need to grasp just how few people (proportionately) are interested. Only a fraction of listeners become fans, and only a fraction of fans are vinyl or CD buyers.

Best of luck with it anyway!",3,,/r/postrock/comments/11orfkf/recommendations_for_selfpublishing/jbwppb9/,"I responded to a similar question recently here and suggest you check out that thread To reiterate though as far as I can work out after releasing my own music for just over a year, your best chance of exposure is getting an album premiere hosted by either World Has Post Rock or Where Post Rock Dwells on YouTube.

jb5aazr,1678116283.0,musicians,maestrosobol,"Spotify is kind of designed for passive listening. The best thing to do is get on some playlists. How to get on playlists is a complicated and time-consuming operation, there’s a lot of scams out there, and any pay for play is very likely not gonna break even, and worse, may result in Spotify demonetizing your music if they think you’re spamming or paid for fake streams. 

That said, it’s probably worth it to throw $100 each at SubmitHub and Groover. Those are vetted, legitimate and active curators and influencers who can get you internet presence, natural buzz, plays from actual playlists, and possibly more followers. You pay $1-2 for them to listen to your song and write you feedback. If they don’t listen or write back, they don’t get paid and you get your money back. 

These submissions also take time and you need to be authentic and write your pitches well and matching according to what they say they’re looking for. I did it and got on a ton of playlists and got some really great Instagram, Facebook, internet radio, local radio and blog shares. Now while I haven’t seen the return for my money in terms of short term streams, maybe long term it will even out, especially since I don’t have much data on the other platforms and some people don’t use Spotify. I figure at the least, it will feed Spotify some data that long term will tell the algorithm how my music connects with a particular listener and I’ll start to get some natural recommendations. 

I also got on some real playlists for free but it takes a lot more time. You have to search playlists and find their contact somehow (sometimes you gotta be super creative to track them down) and after you write a really sincere letter pitching your song and justifying why it matches their playlist, 80% will ignore you completely, 9% will deny you, and 9% will hit you up for money in exchange for playlist placement. That’s a 2% acceptance rate.

j6ugv62,1675294543.0,MusicBattlestations,generalleather,"Hey Nick - I’ll give you some feedback. I’ll start off by saying what I think is working with this tune:

Solid production on the acoustic and vox with the mix and the touches of reverb

Your voice also has a quality that I could see working for a certain type of song as well. I think it suits the vibe of the song pretty well. For some projects, the vocal will kind of stand out as a separate element and I think your voice and the vibe of the song works well together. Not easy to do, so good job there! 

I’m not picky about pitchy vox as I’m more of “vibe” guy, but I could see listeners being turned off by some of pitchy vox on here. Not distracting for me though.

Where I’d focus on improvements for the next song:

You cut off the end of the song, so I’d just be thorough and make sure when you’re bouncing, you’re not cutting it too early. Makes the song feel demo-esque and not a professional production. Keep an eye on those really minor details.

I’d look at your phrasing for your lyrics and how you deliver your words. Seemed like a lot of the verses ran on and as a listener, I never got a sense of when a verse ended or what the melody is - sharpen your approach. Good pop writing will have a easy-to-recall structure and melody for the listener. It’s why some songs you can almost sing along when hearing it for the first time.

Lyrically, I’d work on relying less on oft-used metaphors and tropes. The lyrics felt/sounded earnest, but in a way that I’ve heard a bunch of times before. If you’re gonna keep the lyrics as they are, then the music has to communicate something new or interesting to keep me engaged as the listener. I feel like the line about the blunt stood out to me the most and added some depth to this song, lyrically. Id also recommend finding ways to use more rhyme or rhythm/meter in the structure of your words, cause, again, the lyrics had a wandering, aimless quality to them and I think the song could benefit from something more concrete.

Id also recommend toying with drum machine or something and seeing if you can get some rhythm section going on the next track.

Not really sure about the artwork, but if that’s what you are into, then go for it. For me, it made the whole package just way too sweet and saccharine. For a song like this, I might do something with stark imagery or something nostalgic. Maybe even it juxtapose it with heavy or dark imagery. It all depends on your audience though, so do what you ultimately think represents the track the best!

I’m a DIY recording artist who writes, records and produces his own tunes. I will say the way that I got better and out of my own way was getting brutally honest feedback which can be hard to hear sometimes. You can also submit your music to music critics on Submithub for more feedback, though they can be not the nicest things to read sometimes.

So first, you need to write the correct pitch for Spotify and ensure you pitch that song atleast 4 weeks in advance of your release date. Your pitch is only like 250 characters, and in that you have to prove some combo of:

Why your song is interesting
What’s cool about it
Who has endorsed you previously
Why your band is growing
And maybe even add your social so editors can confirm you’re active

You also MUST have an up to date Spotify profile. This includes multiple HQ pics, header, bio, links, maybe show dates or merch, etc. 

That’s the part you can control the most. Next is ensuring your band is recognized by the editors who manage Spotify editorial. The way you do that is through being active on socials, getting press written about you, playing shows, and getting on Spotify’s algorithmic playlists + “feeder” user generated playlists. The rule of thumb for the Spotify algo is hitting a “popularity score” of about 30% within 21 days of a song release (so about 10,000 organic streams in 3 weeks). User generated playlists are harder to get in if they don’t have a contact. Lots of sites out there that claim to help with user generated placements - the only two that work for cheap are Submithub and Daily Playlists IMO.

Another easy way to get placed is through features - the Spotify algo loves it when you nab features with similar artists on its platform.

So, we wrote a great pitch, we have our profile up to date, we have a ton of fans chatting us up on social, a few outlets have written about us, we have previously had songs in the algorithm, and we even got a sick collab ready to drop. The fact you did ALL of this means a Spotify editor is most likely ready to JUST CONSIDER you for an editorial spot. 

Sometimes that works. Spotify is incentivized to place up and coming, unrepresented artists in their playlists. This helps 1. Retain good active artists to their platform and 2. Gives them street credit when one blows up and they were on it first. But this is where most of these new artists will enlist PR/Marketing agencies to skirt around those gatekeeps and get the ear of whoever is in charge of the playlist. And that kinda sucks. Because that means you need money to hire someone who has that in with Spotify.

I’m in the band Shower Beers and dig learning about this sort of stuff, which is why I can kind of speak to it. We haven’t been on an editorial yet though, so grain of salt.

Playlisting is kind of scammy these days and probably 90% of playlists that list their contact info will hit you up for money, payola or pay for play.  

Spotify-created playlists are notoriously difficult to get accepted to and you need to submit 6-8 weeks prior to release to get a chance.  

You can try browsing Reddit, browsing playlists you think are a good match on Spotify, trying to find their contact information and submitting directly.  It's worked a little for me but it is super time-consuming and rejection/ignoring is high, probably 98%.

So far the best thing that's worked for me is Groover and Submithub.  You pay a couple bucks per submission to curators bloggers and influencers, and they have to listen to it and write you feedback or they don't get paid.  If they like it then they share on their socials and put your song on their playlists.  

ROI for this varies greatly.  Some playlists, these influencers just create out of thin air in order to try and build their following by making the submitters like/follow and artificially pump their numbers.  Sometimes there's no playlist at all and they'll just post an Instagram story with not much info and 24 hours later it's gone and that's all you got for your $2.

SubmitHub is an option, you can search on this sub and r/WeAreTheMusicMakers for peoples thoughts on it. 

If you want strictly numbers make a playlist of similar artists, but ones that are popular, and throw your track in the first 5 songs. So when people go to look up (just an example) B.Love and click playlists they’ll see your “B. Love best tracks and similar” playlist and play it and you’ll sneak your song into it. Easy way to get a few hundred streams. 

They say don’t pay for playlist placements but for me, if you spend $50-$100 on the marketing of your song and it gets on a playlist that racks you thousands of plays I’m not so sure what the problem with that is. I’m a big fan of throw money at the problem and doors magically open. 

The hard way but the cheapest way is go one by one in Spotify and search for user playlists that have a decent amount of likes in a similar genre as you, click the profile and find out their contact info. Send a short but sweet message stating clearly what your intentions are;

“Hi My name is X, I stumbled on your playlist and I think my song “Song” would be a dope addition, here’s the link if you’re interested”

kfzqqgn,1704212443.0,musicmarketing,sg8513,"It’s worth being clear about what the “rules” are with this, and what people think is the right/wrong thing to do.

Paying for streams risks your music coming down, it’s explicitly prohibited by stores.

The term “organic streams” has no real
meaning. Lots of promo services use it, but the stores themselves never use its which means that, even if the service says their streams are 100% “organic”, that offers no guarantee they aren’t doing something the stores don’t want/like.

There isn’t agreement on if paying to pitch is the same as paying for streams. People like submit hub obviously claim they operate entirely within Spotifys terms of use, but it certainly seems that recently that may be changing. 

My personal view is that Spotify offer paid promotion, so therefore any money you spend anywhere else for better visibility or exposure on their platform is money they would like you to spend with them, and they are incrementally working to make that a reality.

Advice and povs on this topic are also dependent on other things. It’s very clear some people want to make money from their music.

iz1mlo8,1670271644.0,edmproduction,Kaael,"&gt; The Internet is the single most powerful tool musicians have ever had to get their music heard next to the invention of the radio. 

Yeah but its an entirely different skillset right? If you don't invest the time in developing skills in PR, marketing, SEO, networking etc then you're kinda fucked. If you don't have connections already, it's an even steeper hill to climb. No money to throw at marketing? Well that hill just became Mt. Everest. 

Sure everyone has the potential to learn those skills, but a lot of people simply don't want to or don't have the means or resources to. Marketing is expensive. 

The most success I've had with my music was paying for the premium Submithub service which got me onto a few decent playlists. I went through the exact same channels with the exact same song on the non-premium service and didn't get a placement. The **only** difference was money. 

If you're doing it as a hobby, then you don't HAVE to do anything you don't want to. You're doing it for fun - you're under no obligation to engage in activities you don't find enjoyable for the sake of validating the hobby. 

I spend 8+ hours a day writing emails, networking and schmoozing people to try and get ahead at work. I don't wanna do that shit when I get home in my leisure time. 

&gt; I've always found that people love placing the blame externally. It's easy to do and absolves them.

This is a reductive stance to take, because there ARE lots of external factors at play. You can't 'willpower' them away, no matter how hard you work. 

Sure, if someone puts 0 effort into marketing their music and complains about industry gatekeepers, there's an argument there.

But for most hobbyists who are releasing music, they're probably putting out tracks on a distro service, promoting it on whatever socials they can, sending cold emails to promoters, labels, DJs etc in the hope that someone picks it up.

 It's screaming into the void - that's what people find demoralising. 

Sure, maybe hard work puts you where luck can find you.

iyknrzt,1669948211.0,MusicPromotion,Tight_Resolution_453,"Hey. Love your article! Also, I will be happy to add you my opinions or tips there. 

1) Your feedback about Submithub. Actually, pay for submission is not bad, as pay for placements. Curators are paid for their time and they need to give honest and proper feedback asap. Actually, before submitting your music to them, I recommend to check their playlists. If your music fits and If the playlists are organic. It's possible to check via https://www.isitagoodplaylist.com/, it's totally free. Then producers won't loose more money. Unfortunately, many producers are submitting music to playlists, which are not for their music.

2) Another good recommendation for promotion is TikTok. But artists can't promote every song on TikTok. 

3) I think it's good to create own playlist, put your song on top 3 - 7 positions and promote that playlist with video ad and on IG feed only. In my experience, The song will be played by 30 - 200% more, than promote single alone via an ad. Also, make own playlist as an artist will bring you more chance to make other fans and more relationships. 

4) My another experience to better reach on FB is make post on the page, put link to song on that post and make ""Reach ad"". That will bring you more clicks, than make ""Conversion ad"". But like 2 - 3 month ago I stopped using FB for ads, now FB gives more bot clicks than IG

5) Actually, artists don't know they need to be active on IG and Spotify too. To be streamed on repeat, you also need some content and of course, good music. Artists need to be active and brings content to IG, share their music, etc, which will bring more streams and possibly more streams from algorithmic playlist like ""On Repeat"". This also could make better popularity ratio. About Spotify, they need to release like once per month or 2 months. Also, they need to refresh artist picks, have a bio with social media, add concerts, merch, etc. Artists don't know Spotify wasn't build for earning money only. The main idea was made streaming service, which will also work as social media and help artists to get discovered.

Or that's my experience anyway. You can choose to pay for certain stuff like longer duration or higher placement if such offers are put on the table, but it's not a requirement.

Having used Muso for the first time in super happy with the results, having received +20 offers in the first 48 hours. Yes l, there are some dodgy offers there, but here are some easy tips to avoid those:

Playlists: URL to playlist will be listed in the offer itself or above it where the curator's social media icons are located. Use it and do your research on playlist likes, plays and user growth. There are web tools for that.

Blogs: Same thing. Use a website traffic checker to check if the site/blog has real visitors or is a scam. Usually you can tell by its layout alone (and comment section and stuff like that just like how you can tell if someone has real followers or what seeem like bots when you check someone's followers on social media).

Social media: as a musician I believe in the power of TikTok and Reels. If you don't that's fine. I personally prefer the latter because IG is still pushing that shit hardcore. Once again, check out peeps' profile and do the research. I wouldn't pay for offers from peeps with low follower count or who share posts or stories who only get a handful to a few hundred likes per post or reel (presentation/design has a lot to do with it too, are the reels clean, catchy, sloppy? Etc), but Muso introduced me to a very lovely and legit influencer/pro photographer who adds music to her reels and has almost 1 mill followers, and each of her reels get like +40k likes minimum. That was a sweet deal and it was also very affordable and a deal like that is something I would take every time. Stuff like that.

So yeah, there are pro and cons to Muso just like with everything else, bit if you put in a little effort and do the research and your music is ok I do believe you should get offers to benefit and be excited for.

I'm in the process of re-releasing my music as I didn't used to have an artist name before (and used to mix genres). The process includes releasing a new single every other Friday. I will definitely run another Muso campaign for my next single as it is an affordable tool for indie artists like myself. Unless peeps wants to suggest something better?

iwh6tpn,1668530891.0,Music,MysticFig,"You mean like through submithub?

I do a lot of actual cold playlist pitching, because my group has a pretty specific inter-genre sound that no one on submithub was looking for and I had to find an alternative l. I paid $7.50 for a quick series of videos on Ari’s Take that was basic instructions on how to do it. (Basically, if they have their name listed, look them up on social media and straight up message them.) 

It feels awkward, but you can also pitch to smaller playlists that “feel” more genuine and have a true exchange with potential fans. It felt really uncomfortable when I started, and one person blocked me outright, but in general people have been happy and receptive, and we get loads of daily plays from the playlists that likes us. So if I was doing this for an indie group I would just cruise Spotify for playlists I liked that had 100-15000 listeners and just message individual playlist curators I think would like it. ! V awkward hahaha but people hear our stuff!!!

The next step we are going to take if we get any money in the band fund is radio promotion. We are planning to pay a guy about $1200 to send us out to loads of folk DJs and do all the follow up stuff and keep us on his newsletter. He offers the same service for singles for $200-400 (can’t remember). He deals with folk music but I know there are people like that for other genres. Of course radio is more relevant for folk/trad than rock/pop but I’m sure that the rock/pop mavens know what’s up

I will say that if we were rock/pop I probably would have signed up for the academy on Ari’s Take which codts about $1200. It seems like that is maybe around the amount of money people should expect to invest for basic professional promotion

iuaoboi,1667079358.0,musicbusiness,kimpletop,"My advice: if you’re no expert, skip the PR

If you’re on your early releases with little traction behind your project, spend your money on ads. PR brings brand legitimacy and that can be helpful when pitching for partnerships, label signature, etc but it’s not going to break your career and it’s definitely not going to jumpstart anything if you’re super early. 

A 500USD PR campaign will do very very very little for you but 500USD well spent on YouTube can garner you 100k views. PR campaigns worth their salt start at 2kUSD (~5k for the US) and are only effective when part of a wider mkg campaign. I wouldn’t put paid PR into a campaign with less than 15k total budget. This varies per market but if you’re in an English speaking market it’s a good rule of thumb. 

SubmitHub kind of sucks, unless your music is extremely formulaic in a playlist friendly genre where a lot of consumption is playlist driven (instrumental piano, lofi, tropical house) you’re unlikely to get meaningful results as the blog ecosystem doesn’t do much anymore and a *lot* of the playlists on SH are dead/dying. 

I’ve spent tens of thousands on PR and now only do it in very specific situations, when the artist already has streaming / social media organic traction and we need some legitimacy for festivals, brands. I’ve had artists on NME, Complex, Clash etc and most of the time it doesn’t do so much for getting their name out there.

SubmitHub kind of sucks, unless your music is extremely formulaic in a playlist friendly genre where a lot of consumption is playlist driven (instrumental piano, lofi, tropical house) you’re unlikely to get meaningful results as the blog ecosystem doesn’t do much anymore and a *lot* of the playlists on SH are dead/dying.  I’ve spent tens of thousands on PR and now only do it in very specific situations, when the artist already has streaming / social media organic traction and we need some legitimacy for festivals, brands. I’ve had artists on NME, Complex, Clash etc and most of the time it doesn’t do so much for getting their name out there.  Focus on content and marketing, they’re all that matters when you’re starting out","my advice if you’re no expert, skip the pr if you’re on your early releases with little traction behind your project, spend your money on ads. pr brings brand legitimacy and that can be helpful when pitching for partnerships, label signature, etc but it’s not going to break your career and it’s definitely not going to jumpstart anything if you’re super early.  a 500usd pr campaign will do very very very little for you but 500usd well spent on youtube can garner you 100k views. pr campaigns worth their salt start at 2kusd (~5k for the us) and are only effective when part of a wider mkg campaign. i wouldn’t put paid pr into a campaign with less than 15k total budget. this varies per market but if you’re in an english speaking market it’s a good rule of thumb.  submithub kind of sucks, unless your music is extremely formulaic in a playlist friendly genre where a lot of consumption is playlist driven (instrumental piano, lofi, tropical house) you’re unlikely to get meaningful results as the blog ecosystem doesn’t do much anymore and a *lot* of the playlists on sh are dead/dying.  i’ve spent tens of thousands on pr and now only do it in very specific situations, when the artist already has streaming / social media organic traction and we need some legitimacy for festivals, brands. i’ve had artists on nme, complex, clash etc and most of the time it doesn’t do so much for getting their name out there.  focus on content and marketing, they’re all that matters when you’re starting out",264,True,False

And I highly advise anyone to never pay for playlists or promotional services because it can absolutely destroy all your hard work as an artist. The increase in monthly listeners from Turkey was from one big playlist, which was a consideration through submithub. At first I was concerned because…You’re right about Turkey having a lot of bots so I personally reached out to Spotify about it. They said they would look into it. Now, I don’t think it is botted though because there are a lot of reputable artists and composers on that playlist, so that put me slightly at ease.

I agree 10,000 in 3 months is near impossible, and without that Turkish playlist, my stats show I’d still be at around 7000 monthly listeners (which would still be considered good). 

It was a combination of all the things I mentioned above, promoting it in different ways, finding similar artists, reddit posts, social posts, and I believe that’s what led to a huge boost from Spotify algorithm playlists. In my first month, Spotify put me on release radar for thousands of new listeners. Many of which liked my music and saved it and kept playing it. I’ve had thousands of streams and listeners on release radar, radio, and discovery weekly as well since then.

Networking. Build relationships with people in your genre. Engage with your fans. “Promote” yourself as much, if not more, than your music

Absolutely. Just make sure they’re more spaced out and can stand on their own

The $30 i spend on there feels worth it: immediate playlist pitching, radio placements, youtube channels; as long as you include your irsc code you'll see that money eventually.

I didn't mention this but with spotify the main goal is getting on editorials. That costs nothing and just depends on good your track is and how well you pitch it. Take a ton of time researching what genre your music falls under and pitch accordingly. I found out for a little bit that I was pitching to the wrong genres and wasted some realeases, so as soon as I came to terms with being a trap producer of some variety I started landing on those and making decent money off streams.  


Marquee feels like the perfect place to spend ad money but it's pretty limited in the US too, or atleast with my limited audience (got like 60 clicks last campaign). Still, I can't wait for it to become available everywhere.

My current ad for my release last Thursday has $59 spent at a cost per click of .01. So far I have 7,675 clicks, and usually can assume about 10% of that were actual people and not bots.  My release just eclypsed 700 plays after 5 days and I can see most of the plays  (67%) are now coming from algorithmic playlists. A few days ago that number was at around 30% with the majority (60%) coming from ""your profile and catalog"" which I can assume most of it was from the ad landing page. The underrated bennifit of my ad is that I'm promoting my art as well, and that has yielded growth on my instagram and facebook; gaining new fans like this is the greatest importance of running ads. I also saw a nice bump of montly listeners of about 4,000; it's tough to determine if that was solely from the ads, or people going to back to school boosting up the study playlists i'm in (likely both).

My budget so far has  hit $60 + $30 from submithub + $20 that has been spent on the marquise campaign = $110. I will spend about $60 more on ads and after 2 weeks the spend will stop and my ROI will begin.My previous EP I released had a very similar projection and ad result, it now has 10,000 plays at 2 months after release putting me at about a $50 ROI at the moment.

The lesson I've learned is that you won't be breaking even more most releases because of this competative and saturated market, but some tracks will break through and that's why you have to stay consistant with every release.

Try browsing through playlists manually on spotify. Find a larger artist in your genre and see what playlists they have been added to.

If the music is good, spotify will see that people are interested and it will reward you algorithmically over time, even if the first couple uploads don't do well.","you've explored many of the primary ways of advertising. ads are a ton of trial and error and are hard to target effectively if the music style is niche. many submithub curators are very specific with the sound the prefer and you generally won't get good results there unless you take the time to listen to the tracks on every playlist you pitch to to see whether or not your track would be a good fit. try browsing through playlists manually on spotify. find a larger artist in your genre and see what playlists they have been added to. then go to each of the playlist profiles to see if their contact info is available, and add any that are to a spreadsheet. then try emailing those curators your track to see if they'll add it. it's tedious, but i've had some luck with doing that. i've also had some luck promoting on facebook groups based on my sound, but i spent a lot of time in them engaging with other people first so they got to know me beforehand. honestly promotion in general is a bit of a long game. you have to map out a release strategy over, say, the next two years and stick to it. if the music is good, spotify will see that people are interested and it will reward you algorithmically over time, even if the first couple uploads don't do well.",238,False,False

SO in my opinion it was a waste of money in the case. Sometimes it work but most of the time - no.

I think you can spend 500$ for designs, ads across platforms such as wetransfer, maybe even here, on ig, tiktok. and deliver your song and visuals directly to listener ears.

Musosoup is nice to try but I have very expensive offers from bloggers who does not have any engagement. I mean the page can have 27k followers and 13-50 likes. I have 850 followers and have 80-150 likes per post. And bloggers ask for 5-22 pound per post.

Count how much ads you can run for such amount of money? And all traffic and account visits will go to your page. 

Facebook ads also run ads on IG. Many media and radio stations use facebook. So don't underestimate the tool.

Even going back to the message board/BBS era of the late 90s/early-mid 00s, it was really tough getting people to listen to your work and provide constructive comments unless you were very active and well-liked within the specific community. On the busiest of forums, self-promotional posts often got buried immediately or you were required to post in separate ""feedback"" sub-groups that generally had little to zero engagement.

In all honesty I think things are a little better today despite the obvious exponential increase in the number of aspiring producers out there. There are loads of ""track roast"" youtube channels for every style now: from popular ones like Kenny Beats to the more niche ones like You Suck at Producing, ERNESTO, Zen World and tons of others. You generally need to be active in their respective Discord communities beforehand, but that's honestly not too much to ask for given the feedback is free.

Submithub's ""Hot or Not"" feature is also pretty good once taken with a grain of salt. I actually use it for unreleased tracks of mine, and have been able to improve loads of personal projects just by taking re-occurring points of contention into consideration.

I have little doubt there will be more paid services provided by well-known professional artists in your style to help improve your music as well over the coming years, if you think that is something of value.",1,,/r/edmproduction/comments/x1dz8p/why_is_getting_feedback_on_tracks_so_difficult/imea4gv/,"The lack of getting quality feedback is nothing new in my observation.

In all honesty I think things are a little better today despite the obvious exponential increase in the number of aspiring producers out there. There are loads of ""track roast"" youtube channels for every style now from popular ones like Kenny Beats to the more niche ones like You Suck at Producing, ERNESTO, Zen World and tons of others. You generally need to be active in their respective Discord communities beforehand, but that's honestly not too much to ask for given the feedback is free. Submithub's ""Hot or Not"" feature is also pretty good once taken with a grain of salt. I actually use it for unreleased tracks of mine, and have been able to improve loads of personal projects just by taking re-occurring points of contention into consideration. I have little doubt there will be more paid services provided by well-known professional artists in your style to help improve your music as well over the coming years, if you think that is something of value.","the lack of getting quality feedback is nothing new in my observation. even going back to the message board/bbs era of the late 90s/early-mid 00s, it was really tough getting people to listen to your work and provide constructive comments unless you were very active and well-liked within the specific community. on the busiest of forums, self-promotional posts often got buried immediately or you were required to post in separate ""feedback"" sub-groups that generally had little to zero engagement. in all honesty i think things are a little better today despite the obvious exponential increase in the number of aspiring producers out there. there are loads of ""track roast"" youtube channels for every style now from popular ones like kenny beats to the more niche ones like you suck at producing, ernesto, zen world and tons of others. you generally need to be active in their respective discord communities beforehand, but that's honestly not too much to ask for given the feedback is free. submithub's ""hot or not"" feature is also pretty good once taken with a grain of salt. i actually use it for unreleased tracks of mine, and have been able to improve loads of personal projects just by taking re-occurring points of contention into consideration. i have little doubt there will be more paid services provided by well-known professional artists in your style to help improve your music as well over the coming years, if you think that is something of value.",245,True,True

I reckon my tracks have close to 1000 downloads from DJs around the planet.

ii0ufwi,1659032954.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,Dear-Boysenberry1709,"Short answer: yes, but there aren’t many great options for newbies with low budgets. Focus mostly on building a network of curators and making good content consistently. Use money to make your mixes and visuals better.

Long answer: Hiring someone to market your music can be very risky unless you know how to do it yourself. Lots and lots of scammers out there because musicians typically don’t have traditional business/marketing training. 

Traditional PR (blogs, magazines) is usually a waste of money unless you’re trying to improve your website’s SEO. Articles written about your music barely generate any streams or followers unless it’s with one of the top 10-20% of music sites. Most music PR firms will charge thousands of dollars for the chance at a handful of write ups on low-mid tier blogs. (source: was a music publicist for 2 years)

It is worth it to do some PR yourself to get good quotes for your press kit, though. This can help you book shows or get signed if you want that. Search for where similar artists (smaller ones with less than 50k monthly streams) have gotten pr recently and find contact info for the people who wrote about them. 

If you want to spend money to promote your music, ads (insta, YT, tiktok) and influencer placements are the best bang for your buck. However, these options can’t take you the whole way, as you’ll have to do a lot of curator outreach and content creation to make either of those paid options worth it. It’s worth learning how to do all this yourself, but there are some agencies with established networks of influencers that could be worth the money.

If you’ve got some $ to spend on marketing, look into services like Playlist Supply and Chartmetric. They can help you research independent playlist curators to pitch your music to. Spending a few bucks here and there on submithub pitches isn’t a bad idea either if your mixes are up to snuff.

We recently released an album (11 songs, 54 minutes in total), and we're basically just starting out trying to create a following.

We had no prior experience with regards to promotion, so we did extensive research on what to do. We landed on releasing 4 singles two weeks apart leading up to the album, and a \~25 second teaser video one week before each single (filmed with a phone on a gimbal, edited in DaVinci Resolve). The teasers were posted on our FB, Instagram and TikTok and had a slightly artsy vibe.

After each single, we put it up on the stories-thing on FB and Instagram. We also filmed interviews with each of the band members which be put up on YouTube, and an interview with the whole band right after the album released. We've pitched a few singles on Submithub, and every single to Spotify's editorial team (none of them were featured on any editorial playlists, though - only on release radar). We also wrote to a bunch of playlists curators, blogs and magazines, but were only picked up by some minor ones. Fun regardless, though we're still hoping some larger player will review the album.

We got our first couple of fan mails a few days ago, which was very fun. We also personally interact with anyone who sends us messages or comments.

It's beneficial if more than one member of the band / group / whatever is fairly social media- and tech-savy, but for us it's just me. So I've done all the social media content creation on behalf of the band.

That being said, it is usually recommend that you leave two weeks before every release day to promote your upcoming song/album to maximise the reach it gets. I think that by releasing every 4- 6 weeks you're probably minimising your chances of gaining traction purely because you're not allowing your fans to hype about your single for long enough before they get hit with a new one.

Also, try to use curator websites like SubmitHub and MusoSoup - if you have a budget for marketing :)

**EDIT:** I'd suggest trying to release a new song every eight weeks, that way there is time for people to absorb your previously released single without it being overshadowed by the next one, and you can easily get your 2 weeks marketing in.

idhra8t,1656026159.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,No_Strategy000,"My band have recently released our first single, and have managed to gain 2,000 Spotify streams in the first month. This was all thanks to the press coverage and playlisting we got from MusoSoup and SubmitHub. I can recommend both from first hand experience, it's about knowing how to market your music and the right people to pitch to. 

It is very trial and error, but once you get to grips with it - it gets you places. *Listeners are listeners* it doesn't matter if they come from the tiniest corner of the internet. It is important to remember that you **will face some amount of rejection** but honestly? I think it is worth it for the amount of bloggers and curators that ***are*** willing to write content on you. 

My tips for success on these sites:

&amp;#x200B;

* **Have a really strong bio** \- both for yourself as an artist and for the track you're pitching. Lazy/non-descriptive bios = uninterested curators. 
* **Make sure the production quality is as good as can be.** I have personally been rejected before due to tracks being of low sound quality. This is something to consider if you're not already working with a professional producer.
* **Pitch your best music.** Since you have to pay for credits etc. it is more cost efficient for you to pitch, say... the best three songs of your album as opposed to the entire work. You're just more likely to get covered if the songwriting is good, therefore not wasting credits and saving them for your next fireeeee release. 
* **Share Share Share.** When you do manage to get added to a playlist or given press coverage, share it on your socials! Bloggers and curators are usually freelances too, and they appreciate the share just as much as you do. Small things like this build relationships and the blog/mag/label is more likely to cover you again if they got a good response last time.

ick1ons,1655364360.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,PrecursorNL,"Promo after you release a song is nice, but ideally you do promo before..

Before:
- source/make enough video content in all formats with your music
- send out to DJs if it's dance music
- send out to IG platforms that support your music I'm stories or posts
- Submithub , not because it's such a great service but to get on a few small playlists for traffic and more importantly to get press coverage on blogs. It's useful if they mention what style your music is in. (For example, spotify uses natural language processing - a type of machine learning - that scans the web for information about you and your track. It helps them place it in context. If you want to reach the right people it could help if you have a lot of press coverage). Of course press coverage goes beyond this as it is a no-brainer, it's content to post about and people can connect with your art on a different level (why, how, where etc). Fans &gt; streams.
- announce your release at least a few times on social media. People aren't likely to check it if they see it once quickly in a scroll
- use a pre-save distributor so you can get more traffic on your release. Ask friends to do it.
- use your creativity. We once did a live stream on twitch where we had front page coverage. It resulted in a lot of traffic to one track that ended up in discover weekly playlist a week later.

After:
- post about your track and share it to your friends, family , communities. Again, you don't want to spam but in order to reach people they might need to see it again before they will check it out. You better have real good music by now because if they check and they don't like it they probably won't check again, maybe unfollow you altogether. Quality is key, always beats quantity.
- on your release day hopefully you have some IG platforms that share your track and tag you. Make sure to share back. It's good to show you have support.
- start tagging your IG stories and tiktok videos with your music with the integrated music options. The more people post with your music the better it is for your spotify growth too. 
- place some snippets on soundcloud and maybe a videoclip on youtube.

Of course you can replace IG with any platform, like Facebook or reddit or wherever you are active. I just prefer it because it's easy to share stories, reach new people and add your music to posts. In that regard TikTok would be even better but the type of content you need for succes on tiktok is more personal and less artsy , or a different kind of art anyway. I'm trying to start it but not entirely comfortable with the format yet. Most of my good friends left Facebook so that's not really worth it either for me personally. Find what works for you. 

You don't need success on every platform to make your music work. You don't need press coverage for everything. You don't need to have every dj playing your track (although it would help). But it's a good idea to have some outlet where you can connect with your fans, even if you have just one fan.

In that regard TikTok would be even better but the type of content you need for succes on tiktok is more personal and less artsy , or a different kind of art anyway. I'm trying to start it but not entirely comfortable with the format yet. Most of my good friends left Facebook so that's not really worth it either for me personally. Find what works for you.  You don't need success on every platform to make your music work. You don't need press coverage for everything. You don't need to have every dj playing your track (although it would help). But it's a good idea to have some outlet where you can connect with your fans, even if you have just one fan. If nobody can talk to you why would they listen to you?","promo after you release a song is nice, but ideally you do promo before.. before source/make enough video content in all formats with your music send out to djs if it's dance music send out to ig platforms that support your music i'm stories or posts submithub , not because it's such a great service but to get on a few small playlists for traffic and more importantly to get press coverage on blogs. it's useful if they mention what style your music is in. (for example, spotify uses natural language processing - a type of machine learning - that scans the web for information about you and your track. it helps them place it in context. if you want to reach the right people it could help if you have a lot of press coverage). of course press coverage goes beyond this as it is a no-brainer, it's content to post about and people can connect with your art on a different level (why, how, where etc). fans > streams. announce your release at least a few times on social media. people aren't likely to check it if they see it once quickly in a scroll use a pre-save distributor so you can get more traffic on your release. ask friends to do it. use your creativity. we once did a live stream on twitch where we had front page coverage. it resulted in a lot of traffic to one track that ended up in discover weekly playlist a week later. after post about your track and share it to your friends, family , communities. again, you don't want to spam but in order to reach people they might need to see it again before they will check it out. you better have real good music by now because if they check and they don't like it they probably won't check again, maybe unfollow you altogether. quality is key, always beats quantity. on your release day hopefully you have some ig platforms that share your track and tag you. make sure to share back. it's good to show you have support. start tagging your ig stories and tiktok videos with your music with the integrated music options. the more people post with your music the better it is for your spotify growth too.  place some snippets on soundcloud and maybe a videoclip on youtube. of course you can replace ig with any platform, like facebook or reddit or wherever you are active. i just prefer it because it's easy to share stories, reach new people and add your music to posts. in that regard tiktok would be even better but the type of content you need for succes on tiktok is more personal and less artsy , or a different kind of art anyway. i'm trying to start it but not entirely comfortable with the format yet. most of my good friends left facebook so that's not really worth it either for me personally. find what works for you.  you don't need success on every platform to make your music work. you don't need press coverage for everything. you don't need to have every dj playing your track (although it would help). but it's a good idea to have some outlet where you can connect with your fans, even if you have just one fan. if nobody can talk to you why would they listen to you?",568,True,False

icg2ids,1655295255.0,musicmarketing,SideDownRecordings,"I used Drop last month after receiving multiple (very convincing) promo mails from Andrew. 

Here's my thoughts:

PROS:

\- They did what they said they were going to do. My song was accepted by 4 playlists and reached 114,000 followers, and I received an email whenever the song was added to a list

\- The playlists look genuine based on Soundcharts data and my own research (curators had social media profiles, lots of Spotify profile followers etc)

\-  I received around 8k streams, just under 200 saves and a handful of follows. I'll let you make your own mind up on whether that's worth $200+, but I was happy enough with the results

CONS:

\- Customer support was slow and there is no # number, just email tickets. I did get a response to every email I sent, but at times I was waiting 2-3 days for a reply. In their defense my queries weren't super important, but if you do need to speak to someone urgently I wouldn't hold my breathe for an instant response

\- If you use them, expect to be hammered with promo emails afterwards. I don't want to unsubscribe as I will most likely use one of their offers again at some point, but it would be nice if there was an option to receive less emails rather than 2-3 per week

Overall I had a pretty positive experience and I will probably run another campaign on one my next releases. But just like PlaylistPush, SubmitHub etc I think success on these platforms really depends on how good your music is and how well it fits with their playlists.

ic5nop2,1655085750.0,groover,mmmusic79,"Thanks for the invite! It looks like I'm going to be the first to leave a reply to a post. That makes me feel special. I recently learned about Groover, about 6 months ago. It's been a better choice for me than Submithub in terms of acceptance rate, and feedback that isn't soul crushing, and I look forward to seeing the improvements on the site. Overall, very happy with it. Just a few suggestions that you may already have in the works. 

I'd love to see playlist stats before submitting to the playlist. I've had playlists with less than 1,000 followers generate 5-10 plays per day for me, and playlists with 20,000 generate 0-2 plays per day. Seeing monthly average plays for songs on the playlist would be very helpful. 

I definitely prefer when the Spotify link goes directly to the playlist instead of the user profile, so that I can see the other artists on the playlist. The playlist following also shouldn't be aggregate, unless there's a potential to be on every single playlist that curator has. It should just be the playlist total for the playlist that the curator adds the most songs to.

Finally, I'd love to be able to filter by acceptance rate. For example, only submitting to playlists with an acceptance rate between 20% and 60%. This is lower on my wishlist, since you can already choose 15% or higher.

With that said i don't wanna discurage you to make music, but the opposite, cause it's true that somewhere there are people that would like it if they could discover you. it's just the discovery system hacked by bigs, that's why live gigs help, cause you can reach people directly.

ibl4s8h,1654677056.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,hotcurry84,"I see your POV but I don't think it's necessarily that simple in the scenario that you have zero followers/listens on Spotify and brand new social accounts with nearly zero followers.

I didn't say my strategy was to release bad songs, just not my very best tracks out the gate.

Why? Cause Spotify releases music to your actual followers to their release radar to drive algorithmic plays. The more followers you build up the algorithm drives. Also your socials build up in a similar fashion. For example, actually having real IG followers when you run your organic social campaigns gets more eyeballs on it out the gate than when you have a brand new account with zero followers.

When you have zero everything you're announcing into thin air and just hoping for a homerun from a completely blank slate, which is then largely gated by playlist curators and other gatekeepers letting you in the door.

What do gatekeepers think about an artist with zero fans and absolutely no history? Probably not much, unless the song is a huge, huge undiscovered gem and/or you are one of those super rare artists who is so incredible you can go from nothing to huge growth in 1 song.

Otherwise your only hope of not promoting into thin air and wasting one of your best songs is going super viral.. ie blowing up on TikTok on a video... what are the chances of that? Pretty slim.

Like I said even though SubmitHub didn't pick it up, most of them said the song was good and my song is gaining streams and follows and the social accounts are growing little by little each day through the other marketing channels (ie ads, socials). It's not much but I have to start somewhere and I'm only 5 days in.

Now when I release my next one in 6 weeks I will have an audience out the gate who will see my song and care about the new release for free and I'm not back in the same place figuring out how not to promote into thin air and having to pay as much money for ads to cold audiences as my only way to get stuff out.

In fact I think I'm more likely to get playlist plays cause at least I have some presence. Then the 3rd release... even more followers I'm releasing to and so on.

The other aspect is.. say I did release my best song out the gate? Okay then what? The second song is not gonna be as good? All those followers I get are gonna be pretty disappointed if the releases keep getting worse over time...

Again, I'm not saying I don't see your POV,  But I debated for this for a long time and chose to go the long-term route instead of going for it all right out the gate. My best songs are dropping soon just not first (so I at least have some built-in audience).  Maybe leading with your absolute best song is the way to go for some who are brand new.  I decided it wasn't the case for me. Could I be wrong? Sure who the hell knows. I really happy with my choice so far though.

Use https://www.isitagoodplaylist.com and examine the data it gives you. Is the playlist growing organically? Who streams this playlist?

You will get 99 rejections and 1 yes, if you’re lucky.

Besides submithub, run ads to increase organic plays and drive people to your music. Cut out the middleman and do it yourself.

2. Is it comparable to other music on the playlist in terms of style and mix quality?
3. What’s the best part about your track?

Feedback for my lofi stuff was that my style fit on sleepy beats, and I accept that. I purposely go to lofi quality in all of my work and it was meant as music to switch off to

For my other stuff I genuinely didn’t know what genre it was. I made it and thought it was cool. It had elements of lots of styles, not fast but not slow, not chill but not exciting either.
Feedback was that it had a good progression, good drums etc but did not fit with the style they had. And I accept that, I had no idea either.
I also had comments about the professionalism of the mix. Which I accept my style isn’t for everyone

ibhnk87,1654611659.0,WeAreTheMusicMakers,PrecursorNL,"About submithub, It's a little bit of both. Lot of people send mediocre tracks and expect/hope to get playlisted. In fact growing a playlist requires _really_ good and interesting music for people to follow it and _actively listen to it_. On top of that to grow a playlist it has to have a clear theme and fact of the matter is that not a lot of tracks fall exactly in this category so the rate of accepting is quite 'low' depending on the curator.

Suppose you have good music and a clearly defined sound it doesn't mean succes. You still have to pick the right curators to send to. And that is the genuinely rubbish thing about Submithub, because most playlists are just so small that they have absolutely no relevance for becoming succesful as a musician. Most 'curators' are just not very influential or good.. then there's also a bunch of fake ones that run many playlists with many followers, almost always indicating that their playlists are filled with bots or fake accounts. These will actively fuck up your chances on becoming succesful on some platforms.

Okay so why could you argue Submithub is still valuable? Three things. First is already mentioned in this thread. It's cheap and now and then you have a chance to get in an actual (real) good playlist for basically a dollar or three. That's a no-brainer and worth the effort from a marketing perspective. Secondly, small playlists may not generate any meaningful plays but they do add traction to your track and expose you to potential new fans. If you get enough traction on a release you may strike lucky and get on a spotify algorithmic playlist. You don't need a lot of plays on the track for that necessarily, but good interaction. So small playlists may be worth the effort if you get on enough of them. Finally, there's blogs and press. This is key for your online presence as an artist.
