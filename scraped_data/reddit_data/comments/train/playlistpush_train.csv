Of course, it helps to have a label backing you (even small indie ones), as they often have connects at these DSPs and can get your song to the right ear. This is particularly how you see artists with little to no audience and nothing released get their first releases on editorials. 

That being said, I know people who’ve gotten placements on official playlists with self-released tracks just by pitching through Spotify for Artists (no equivalent for Apple yet). I can tell you with complete certainty that your profile on Spotify doesn’t matter all that much - the quality of your pictures, what you write in your bio, pretty much irrelevant. 

Your music counts. Make it good and release it as consistently as you can. When you’re pitching, give a good description of the track, say where you’re based, and feel free to suggest a couple of fitting playlists. 

Spotify used to be more of a level playing field. I remember when you could contact curators directly through google forms. Unfortunately not the case anymore, due both to over-saturation and a lot of major label involvement with DSPs. Not to mention them blindly favouring whatever is going viral on TikTok and Insta right now. 

Don’t sleep on indie playlists and blogs. I would not recommend sites like PlaylistPush or Groover (as someone who’s been a curator). Just not a fan, and seems pretty low value. Submithub works and is my favourite of these types of sites. Again, make sure your description and profile is up to date, and submit to the right places - blogs included. Write ups (and sites like Hype Machine) used to be more important, but they still hold some value. 

Best of luck, don’t stop what you’re doing just because of a lack of attention from Spotify and the like. This industry isn’t easy and thrives on personal connections. But it’s really about the music, don’t forget that.

jxr3zts,1693000526,musicmarketing,MysticCherryBlossom,"I haven't used playlistpush. 

I tried SubmitHub but only ever got rejected. I got tired of tracking down curators, listening to their playlists for like 30 minutes to make sure it was a good fit, writing a pitch to submit, and then still ultimately getting rejected so I decided I would just pay people to push my songs for me. No, I'm not talking about paying people to place me on a playlist (that's probably botted), but paying to have 3rd parties push my songs to legitimate curators.

So far, I have used YouGrow, Indie Music Academy, and Partnered Projects. There's dangers in using services like those too. In case you do decide to go this route:

YouGrow will 100% get you fast streams, but as someone mentioned, it was mostly Latin American streams, which probably fucked up my algorithm. You live and you learn right?

Indie Music Academy probably gave me the best results. I got on a great playlist, got some really good streams, got added to some other playlists from just being on that one, someone actually reached out to me on IG after finding me on this playlist, and I still get some streams on that song from people who found me on this playlist (not a lot but still more than any of my other songs). Couple of things about them though, they were only able to find placement for 1 of the 3 songs I submitted to them(refunds are guaranteed if they can't place you). And, it takes them fucking FOREVER to place you. Like, it took me weeks before they placed my 1 song, and then like a month or two before they told me they couldn't place me for the other 2. That's a LONG time. I didn't realize how long and thought this was normal until I tried Partnered Projects.

After Indie Music Academy kept being unable to place me, I tried Partnered Projects. They have somewhat of a co-sign from Andrew Southworth, so I figured they were probably legit. It only took them a few days to place me, and they were probably the best at actually placing me on RELEVANT playlists. The promotion I started with them is currently still running, so I am not sure how good the long term effects will be but I am happy enough with the results I want to use them again. In fact, probably going to use them for the song I just released AND the one after that. They also don't guarantee you placement, so they don't charge you until they have secured you a placement.

Anyway, paying for playlisting in anyway isn't a great idea (saying this as someone who does it) since as I mentioned it can fuck up your Spotify algo if you end up on the wrong playlists and also the long term benefits are questionable. While I got on some personal and smaller playlists from being on these paid playlists, I didn't gain any followers from it. So, lots of short term listeners, a few long term listeners of those particular songs, but no actual fans.

Only reason I still use this method is because this is the only method where I have seen SOME positive gains. I am currently promoting my new song harder than I have promoted ANY song ever (haven't paid to have it pitched for playlisting yet) by using ads on IG while also posting regularly on TikTok and YouTube. So far, the results have been abysmal (it's only been a week so far), so yeah...I can only do what I can until I start performing live, which will hopefully be the push I need to actually start gaining a following.

jrwii12,1689315207,makinghiphop,DJGrumbleOfficial,"What's up man. Kinda going backwards with my response, but what you're doing with the playlists is what I'm trying to do right now myself. That's one area I haven't really experimented with much until now. I've created a couple spotify playlists with mostly my production, and I'm working on getting people to save/follow them. I've never ran ads on social media but from what you described it seems like it can be cost effective. What I do is just pin a playlist to my Artist Pick and it picks up a few follows per day. My long-term goal is to get a few playlists with thousands of followers and then monetize them by becoming a playlist curator for PlaylistPush/SubmitHub/etc. As for your specific questions:

(1) I stuck with PlaylistPush just because that's the one I tried first based on reviews, and their playlists seem to be pretty high quality overall - no botted streams. I've made accounts with SubmitHub and SoundCamps but just never committed $$ to them. SoundCamps seemed like I was spending a LOT more to pitch to fewer playlists compared to PP.

(2) I kinda mix what I shop to rappers vs my self-published discography. Most of the stuff I shop for major label placements I keep off Spotify. I haven't run into any pitfalls as far as distributing the same beats that I shop to artists, BUT that's because I also don't use Content ID on anything. I deliberately keep everything out of Google/Meta Content ID because then everyone who uses a beat will start getting copyright strikes on YT/FB/IG etc. One of the main things that helped my beats go viral was YouTubers using my beats off SoundCloud in their videos. I allow all my beats to be downloaded for free and used with credit. I probably wouldn't be where I am today if I didn't have my whole catalog basically free on SoundCloud. When I sell a beat to a local/indie artist what they're essentially paying for is the extended HQ beat + stems.

(3) I think building playlists of your music is a great idea, as I discussed before, that's something I am working on. People tend to have short attention spans and usually can't be bothered to click through your discography and explore all of your releases in-depth. So putting your music in a more digestible format like a playlist I think would definitely improve your engagement and algorithmic scores.

My top-performing tracks on Spotify have popularity scores around 50%. In the last year or so, I've noticed a positive feedback loop occurring where my songs are heavily recommended to users in algorithmic playlists (mainly Radio), then they like/share/playlist the song, which causes the rank to go higher, which causes more engagement, etc. So I think I've finally got the sweet spot of Spotify popularity where the algorithm is recommending me to basically anyone listening to instrumental hip hop. My monthly listeners are going up by several thousand a day, I've never seen anything like it honestly.",2,2.0,/r/makinghiphop/comments/14xvfvj/how_much_do_you_need_to_earn_monthly_to_quit_your/jrwii12/,"What's up man. Kinda going backwards with my response, but what you're doing with the playlists is what I'm trying to do right now myself. That's one area I haven't really experimented with much until now. I've created a couple spotify playlists with mostly my production, and I'm working on getting people to save/follow them. I've never ran ads on social media but from what you described it seems like it can be cost effective. What I do is just pin a playlist to my Artist Pick and it picks up a few follows per day. My long-term goal is to get a few playlists with thousands of followers and then monetize them by becoming a playlist curator for PlaylistPush/SubmitHub/etc. As for your specific questions (1) I stuck with PlaylistPush just because that's the one I tried first based on reviews, and their playlists seem to be pretty high quality overall - no botted streams. I've made accounts with SubmitHub and SoundCamps but just never committed $$ to them. SoundCamps seemed like I was spending a LOT more to pitch to fewer playlists compared to PP. (2) I kinda mix what I shop to rappers vs my self-published discography. Most of the stuff I shop for major label placements I keep off Spotify. I haven't run into any pitfalls as far as distributing the same beats that I shop to artists, BUT that's because I also don't use Content ID on anything. I deliberately keep everything out of Google/Meta Content ID because then everyone who uses a beat will start getting copyright strikes on YT/FB/IG etc. One of the main things that helped my beats go viral was YouTubers using my beats off SoundCloud in their videos. I allow all my beats to be downloaded for free and used with credit. I probably wouldn't be where I am today if I didn't have my whole catalog basically free on SoundCloud. When I sell a beat to a local/indie artist what they're essentially paying for is the extended HQ beat  stems. (3) I think building playlists of your music is a great idea, as I discussed before, that's something I am working on. People tend to have short attention spans and usually can't be bothered to click through your discography and explore all of your releases in-depth.

jrwgmdt,1689313900,makinghiphop,TapDaddy24,"Yo thank you a TON for giving such an in-depth response. This is really insightful hearing your budget, number of playlists, size of playlists, what you were targeting and how that worked in your successful early campaign. My wife and I have been really trying to dive into music marketing these past few months, trying to set up the momentum to hit algorithmic pushes on Spotify regularly.   


I have a few follow up questions you have time for em. And no worries at all if not.  


1) Have you tried other playlisting services such as SubmitHub / is there any particular reason why you use PlaylistPush?   


2) Do you distribute beats that you also sell or do you keep your discography separate from what you shop by rappers? Do you see any potential pitfalls for distributing beats for instrumental listening while also selling licensing on them to rappers?  


3) Do you think consistent algorithmic push could be achieved through investing in building deep playlists of only your music? I suppose successful examples of this would be Lofi Girl or organizations like ChillHop Music, Fantastic FM, and JazzHop Cafe. Do you see any pros or cons to chasing that sort of advertising model?  


I know these are kinda specific questions but I'd be very curious to hear your perspective. I have 295 beats distributed on platforms right now. I am also selling licenses to all of them on BeatStars. I really don't see many producers doing that, and so I'm curious if I am somehow shooting myself in the foot by also offering artists an accessible way to obtain permissions to these beats which they may be hearing on my Spotify.   


As you may have guessed, we are chasing a bit of a Lofi Girl, ChillHop Music, etc., type model where we are investing in Instagram ads (via facebook ad manager), and growing instrumental playlists which only contain my productions and collabs. We have been running very small campaigns ($100-$250) for the past 3 &amp;1/2 months. Through these ads, we've managed to find a few tracks that are getting pretty damn good costs per conversion (at least I think so, compared to all of the numbers in the tutorials we've been watching). Our most popular playlist is our ""Jazzy HipHop"" playlist which has gotten over 1000 saves with about $250-$350ish spent in advertising for it. I've currently got 1800 monthlies and we haven't hit any significant algorithmic push yet, though I'm hoping to make that leap soon. I've hit a a decent release radar push in the past without any advertising. Now, with some new releases that came out during the start of this last campaign, I've now got a few tracks approaching a spotify popularity score of about 20%. I predict that we might be able to hit a push with one or two more campaigns if we really go for it on the right releases with the right playlist. Guess we'll see.

jrwbnbz,1689310657,makinghiphop,DJGrumbleOfficial,"No problem. The keys to success with playlisting services, in my experience, are the following:

(1) the music has to be good! playlist curators are picky. you can burn your whole budget and get no placements if you submit something they don't like. if you submit something wack, there is zero point to doing playlist pitching. so I only pitched my absolute strongest tracks that I knew had broad appeal. which leads me to the next point:

(2) target your genres well. don't just submit to ""hip hop"" and ""rap"" playlists, find every possible subgenre that could apply to your track and pitch to those playlists as well. also look up the names of subgenres in other languages (spanish, french etc) and submit to those so you can get the international audience.

(3) put a good budget behind it. $1000-1500 on PlaylistPush would usually get the results I was looking for. For that price I would usually get about 50 playlist adds, with each playlist having anywhere between 5,000-100,000 followers on average. I was targeting \~100,000 streams in the initial 3-6 months after the campaign with an eventual goal of 1M streams, which pays for the campaign at that point. So really you're giving the track a good initial ""shove"" to where it starts organically gaining traction just by more people engaging with and sharing the music.

A couple examples of tracks that I promoted with PlaylistPush

Blake Anthony - Flaus (2019) - 3.3M plays

Blake Anthony - Flawless (2019) - 3.1M plays

Kam Robinson - Drink More Water (2020) - 1.4M plays

Kam Robinson - How u feel (2019) - 1.2M plays

The initial playlist campaign on the above tracks has continued to pay off as they remain popular and generate significant income. And as I alluded to, not every campaign is a slam dunk. Some tracks do better than others, but that's just the music biz in general. You win some and lose some.

I've heard that landing a big playlist can do great things for that one song, but ultimately, it's rare that people would leave that playlist and find their way back to the rest of your discography. So I guess I'm just curious, does that even matter? Is your strategy for PlaylistPush just to get algorithmic push on that one song? I'd also be curious to hear your thoughts on Marquee. How's that compare to traditional advertising like with insta ads through facebook manager. Any advantage to using Marquee instead? In any case, thanks for sharing. Keep it up man. Love your music.","man that's really interesting to hear. i know you've got 500k monthlies and are hoping to hit 1m on spotify through hitting release radar pushes each week. not gonna lie, i'm really curious to watch it happen. i'm rooting for you man. i'm a bit interested to hear that playlisting is part of your marketing. i know that can boost your monthlies and get a big push on one song. i've heard that landing a big playlist can do great things for that one song, but ultimately, it's rare that people would leave that playlist and find their way back to the rest of your discography. so i guess i'm just curious, does that even matter? is your strategy for playlistpush just to get algorithmic push on that one song? i'd also be curious to hear your thoughts on marquee. how's that compare to traditional advertising like with insta ads through facebook manager. any advantage to using marquee instead? in any case, thanks for sharing. keep it up man. love your music.",172,False,False

icg2ids,1655295255,musicmarketing,SideDownRecordings,"I used Drop last month after receiving multiple (very convincing) promo mails from Andrew. 

Here's my thoughts:

PROS:

\- They did what they said they were going to do. My song was accepted by 4 playlists and reached 114,000 followers, and I received an email whenever the song was added to a list

\- The playlists look genuine based on Soundcharts data and my own research (curators had social media profiles, lots of Spotify profile followers etc)

\-  I received around 8k streams, just under 200 saves and a handful of follows. I'll let you make your own mind up on whether that's worth $200+, but I was happy enough with the results

CONS:

\- Customer support was slow and there is no # number, just email tickets. I did get a response to every email I sent, but at times I was waiting 2-3 days for a reply. In their defense my queries weren't super important, but if you do need to speak to someone urgently I wouldn't hold my breathe for an instant response

\- If you use them, expect to be hammered with promo emails afterwards. I don't want to unsubscribe as I will most likely use one of their offers again at some point, but it would be nice if there was an option to receive less emails rather than 2-3 per week

Overall I had a pretty positive experience and I will probably run another campaign on one my next releases. But just like PlaylistPush, SubmitHub etc I think success on these platforms really depends on how good your music is and how well it fits with their playlists.

Since they went down that road, I think they left out the large non-editorial playlist world and the abundance of playlisting middlemen, such as Submithub, PlaylistPush, Groover, etc.  It appears Spotify feels a bit threatened or at least sees the financial potential there as they recently started a non-editorial curator's playlisting pilot.  Very curious how they develop this, if at all.  An article from back in April if you are curious:

hge0ff5,1634065555,playlists,Thibaut09,"Thank you so much for this feedback. I'm not a native speaker so some of the sentences will be on nothing....   
  
To answer your questions: I make a playlist for several reasons, which is why I also want a perfect name for my playlist.   
  
First, I am very passionate with music. Especially Hiphop/rap and believe it or not underground techno (I live in Belgium and here techno is very in). music is like many something to isolate myself.   
Many 25+ (I'm not talking about you!) will not understand my taste in hip hop as many modern rap are less appreciated by ""older"" people.   
  
As such, I have received a lot of negative feedback on the playlist(name) when I promoted it on hip hop reddit pages. Nevertheless, I have a lot of understanding of the latest hip/hop and follow it hard.  
 In addition, I am personally making Hip/hop as an artist. a great playlist boosts a small individual artist directly.   
  
In addition, I know there is a big market for the music in the playlist. Rap/hip and pop are the biggest music genres and very much in with the youth (14-25). Still where I live, assume it's the same in the US.  
  
I also did my homework on how to make money with a more popular playlist. There are websites like playlistpush that will give you money if you have a good playlist. (For more info you should look it up as it is quite a process). In addition, the playlist can also work with placements, where artists pay a little to be on the playlist.  
The best way to make great playlist (in terms of followers) are ads. I am also willing to do that once my playlist preparation is done.

indie artists are virtually invisible. there are many playlists that take submissions for free, but your chances of being heard/placed are hella low for any of them with significant plays.

then there are shit a shit ton of pseudo pay to place, like submithub and playlistpush, you pay to be considered by a huge amount of playlists and the playlists make a little bit of money to listen to your submission.

then of course, if a random individual puts their contact info in their playlist, you might be able to reach out to them directly and ask to be on their playlist.

even after all of this, any of those playlists may have bot follows and bot plays, spotify doesn't crack down on it cuz it doesn't affect their bottom line.

luckily for you I've saved the thread, look for: 

""SubmiHub and PlaylistPush - Extensive Review and Comparison - My experience and results - Why they are not a scam""

What kind of music are you making?

As for not finding enough playlist curators, I can tell you only about my own experience as submitter.

Yes, there seems to be quite a difference between the outlets you get shown, when you use only the free credits versus the paid ones.

But for most it makes sense, as they ask for three credits, so you will never get them displayed, with just 2 standard / free credits. Also, as a ""receiver"" you can chose to just get paid submissions, so these you also will not see with just standard credits. Besides that, I have the feeling there is an algorithm or something at work, which checks how much you have tried to submit a certain song with standard credits, but I cannot prove that. 

Anyway, if you wanna use submithub to its fullest potential, I guess you will need to buy a few credits, to take full advantage of it.

And read the very thourough post (see above) as this guy really reseached his receiver targets and wrote about this in great detail. I would advise you to do the same to get the most out of your credits.

Let me know if you have any further questions. My receiving account on Submithub is ""Radio Dark Tunnel (Shellshocked Radio)"", if you wanna check it.

ez4ic78,1567687302,musicmarketing,nmr_azu,"I'm on the small playlist side. 

When it comes to listens, the bigger the playlist the smaller the engagement rate.  
More so, many big playlists use follow gates - ***they force the artist to follow / like them before submitting his music***. This creates a huge gap between followers and listeners.   


I found a small trick to find quality Spotify playlists, it's slightly technical but worth it IMO.  


1. open spotify on your desktop.
2. open google chrome inspect (on mac cmd+shift+c)
3. find artist that is similar to you style wise and has 10 times your followers.
4. click his about page. for [example](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7cu3oi92lUe550VejeSeP3/about) 
5. go to the Networks tab in inspect and search urls that match *spclient.wg.spotify.com/open-backend-2/v1/artists*
6. click on it, you'll now see four tabs: headers, preview, response, timing. click on **preview**
7. click on '**artistInsights**' and click '**playlists**' 

You can see the top playlists this artist is discovered on WITH THE NUMBER OF MONTHLY LISTENERS FROM IT!   
`""name"": ""Berlin Electronic Underground"", ""owner"": { ""name"": ""xburglarcatx"", ""uri"": ""spotify:user:xburglarcatx"" }, ""listeners"": 127`

&amp;#x200B;

Now start hunting these curators down, they might be available through submission sites like [submithub](https://submithub.com), [mysphera](https://mysphera.co) or [playlistpush](https://playlistpush.com).

This alone makes it infinitely better than 90% of the ways you send your music out into the void from emails to blog posts, because while you can know how many people listened (the play count on your soundcloud), you don't know WHO listened. Most music that's sent out never even gets considered by influencers, let alone makes it to enough ears in the market place to live or die on its own merit.   


As for the rest of them, depends how much money you have to burn. Playlistpush resulted in quite a bit of feedback, but the ratio of ""Love it, but not for my list"" to actual Playlist acceptance makes me wonder how well the pools you pay to submit into are curated.   


That story accelerates vastly when you bring in specific pushers. Note MOST publicists don't do specific User generated playlists, and definitely don't do Spotify internal. Spotify internal is all a game between connected people (ala the management mentioned in another response), distributors (but not like Tunecore, CDbaby, etc), and the algorithm. Playlist ads and listener to save ratios are a big trigger for those supposedly. Yes you can submit via the Artist dashboard now, but I'll standby for any case studies of it actually resulting in editorial playlisting.   


If you KNOW your stuff is good, and have the budget and the confidence to see if you are right, start with Submit hub making sure you know you are sending it to the right people. If that shows great results, I'd recommend stepping it up by pushing music videos directly to listeners via Facebook or Youtube ads. I'm not going to go through the how, but you should target fans/listeners of bands that you think their fans would like your stuff.   


If you get good results from that, then worry about finding management because you've either got to be remarkably talented raw potential, or bringing demonstrable value (which we can all see via your Spotify play trending, or these ad metrics) to convince someone to work with you who is any good on essentially long term commission.

kaa1e5w,1700643330,musicmarketing,Krimshaw_42,"So my personal biggest takeaway is unfortunately not a great one.  I think when I started a few years ago I saw more hope than I do now for indie artists, but there's still some good news as well.  A lot of the bad news is related and it boils down to a few things. 

- All Social Media has become hostile to creators / artists.  They have suppressed their algorithms.  Organic reach is nearly impossible.  This is not by accident.  They want you to buy Ads.  They need you to buy Ads because they're publicly traded companies who need to generate more and more revenue.  That's just how the market works.  They start cool and artist friendly (TikTok) - then they get a critical mass of users and start going way too heavy on monetization, effectively ruining what made the platform cool.   So it's not your imagination.  The deck is increasingly stacked against you.  Right now there are no artist friendly platforms. None.  Zero.   Threads could change that if they get hashtags and DMs going.  Until then they are a non factor.

Spotify and YouTube.  You need to understand these are not profitable businesses.  So while yes, they are not paying artists hardly anything, they aren't turning a profit either.  Streaming is not a good business model.  You have to remember that for 10 years all content was effectively being stolen on Torrents and Limewire and before that Napster.  Piracy wiped out the traditional music industry completely.  Streaming is an attempt to bring it back but even big artists are not making bank and neither is Spotify.  The money is in having fans.  Fans that pay to see you live.  Buy merch (although the overhead on that is not great, until you're moving huge amounts of it).  So realistically the game is this, get fans and play live shows - or sell them stuff.  Physical Media, or Merch if you don't plan on playing live.  Or you could go the influencer / Podcaster route.

That being said - Spotify still has a HUGE market share of streaming activity AND presents a massive opportunity to reach fans anywhere in the world.  This is the good news.  It's a global market!  When you dig into the data on Chart Metric - most of the biggest streaming markets are in Latin America.  They LOVE music down there and the currency exchange rate is extremely favorable. 

So, if you have a small marketing budget, I would honestly put it towards Spanish language Ads in Central and South America and also Portuguese Ads in Brazil. 

Then, very important, I would familiarize yourself with Google Translate.  This is the part of the job I enjoy most.  The most important thing you can do to turn a casual listener into a fan is actually very simple. 

Talk to them.  Technology is now a great tool and without speaking a word of Spanish you can have a full conversation with someone in Guatemala.  Who will actually be grateful to hear from you.  And you'll learn about other countries and their culture. Their perspectives.  And your money will go infinitely further than trying to compete in the oversaturated and incredibly expensive to advertise in Primary Markets that everyone is always advertising in.  You can also learn how to run ads for $1 / day until you get better at it and then apply what you've learned to the major markets. 

Other than that, the biggest thing I would suggest is having a decent playlisting budget.  Spotify claims payola isn't allowed but that is an outright lie.  Every decent playlist wants money or a paid service to reach the curators and Spotify does not enforce their policies AT ALL.  There are some free resources to help with playlists, and sure, you can spend all day pitching, but you won't move the needle without money.  Why is playlisting important?  If done correctly it will train the algorithm to recommend your song to the right people.  And that is when Spotify starts working for you, not against you.  You must pitch the right songs to the right playlists though. Really know your genre, sub-genre, mood, activity, target audience.  (Gym / Workout playlists are popular for example.  Summer Playlists.   Chill Playlists.  Driving Playlists.)  You need to know the playlisting landscape. There's over FOUR BILLION playlists on Spotify!  And very few good ones!

Free Playlist Services:
Soundplate.Com
DailyPlaylists.Com

Good Subscription Services:

Artist.Tools (most valuable because they have a bot vetting service that is very helpful)
Playlist Supply
Playlist Hunter

SubmitHub is good for hitting up a few dozen curators and maybe some influencer placements if you're on a budget.  $100 worth of credits can get you meaningful results

Playlist Push is probably the best premium service - starts at $297 though - goes up to $5k campaigns

Indie Music Academy also starts at $297 - if you just wanna get in some big playlists, guaranteed streams and juice your numbers, they start at 10k guaranteed streams

Then after that there's a bunch of smaller players or ones I've not read good reviews on that I wouldn't use

My artists I've worked with have small and tight budgets, and are self financing their careers, so we're always looking to stretch every dollar far as we can so I just thought that might help some of you out and answer some questions.  I'm happy to answer any specific questions but that's kind of the main overview of what I've learned in a couple years in this crazy ""business""

Long live independent music!

Screw the corporate gatekeepers and the big money keeping all you talented mofos down!

I was told by one curator that I should get a better VST plugin for my strings, another one told me I should spend some money on getting it mastered, and someone else complained that they didn't the EQ was very good.   
Even if you do get on a playlist, you end up on something like ""Driving music"" which is often times heavily botted, and then dumped off it a month later.

I was actually on the other side of playlist push, as a curator receiving music to review (somehow one of my jazz playlists amassed a large following).

Because the platform refused to push to me anything remotely close to the genre or tone of the playlist. It was downright comedic how far away these songs were.
