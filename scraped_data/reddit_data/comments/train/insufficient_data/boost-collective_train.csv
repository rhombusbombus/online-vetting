kqdd7zd,1707909802.0,GodofWarRagnarok,JacktheRipperBWA,"Defense is the stat that allows Kratos to take more hits before dying essentially. It decreases the amount of damage you sustain from an attack which is obviously really helpful. 

A defense that high is helpful for newer players or players not as adept at playing on easier difficulties and is a helpful boost to players on higher difficulties such as ""Give Me No Mercy"" or ""Give Me God Of War"" were Kratos is able to die in just a few hits. 

A good armor piece of use for high defense is the Steinbjorn Plackart because at base level (6), it gives you 123 defense and increases to 190 defense at level 9. However, what makes the Steinbjorn Plackart so helpful is its ability ""Bloodthirsty Retaliation."" Bloodthirsty Retaliation: ""After significant damage is taken, Kratos' attacks will restore some lost Health for a time"" any attack that causes Kratos to lose a decent amount of health will trigger this effect which allows any and all attacks to regain some health.

A combination that makes this healing effect 100x more potent is wearing the ""Girdle of Raven Tears"" and the ""Bracers of Ravens Tears"" because the effect on both gear pieces is this ""Increases the healing from Healthstones, Rage, and Gear by 15%. If both are equipped, it's 30%."" 

So, each piece increases healing by 15% individually and combined it increases to 30%. That means each time you deal damage while ""Bloodthirsty Retaliation"" is active, you get back 30% more health from each single attack you do on an enemy. 

Another way to increase this healing and make it even MORE broken is to use the Spartan Rage ""Fury"" whilst wearing this setup. Spartan Rage: Fury already heals Kratos on each hit, so when combined with the ""Girdle/Bracers Of Raven Tears"" your ""Fury"" does 30% more health per attack, this *stacks* with ""Bloodthirsty Retaliation"" which means both abilities active at the same time will giving you back health 2x once from ""Bloodthirsty"" Retaliation"" and once from Spartan Rage: Fury"" 

Since both abilities heal and the ""Girdle/Bracers of Raven Tears"" increase healing by 15% (30% with both), each ability gets its own boost to its healing effect. This means you get 30% better healing from ""Bloodthirsty Retaliation"" and 30% better healing from ""Spartan Rage: Fury."" When using both abilities at the same time, it stacks the healing together from both abilities, and each gets its own 30% boost, which means you get 60% boost collectively. 

This means that using ""Bloodthirsty Retaliation"" and ""Spartan Rage: Fury"" at the same time will give you 60% health back each time you damage a foe, the healing is so powerful you go from 1 hit from death to full health after 1 use of ""Spartan rage: Fury."" The healing from Fury using this setup vastly outclasses the healing from ""Valor"" by a wide margin, plus it has the added benefit of dealing damage to your opponents as you get health back.

This armot setup helped me beat ""Give Me God Of War"" for the first time and was instrumental for me in order to beat Gna on ""Give Me God Of War"" as well. Once you get this setup it can carry you through the whole game on any difficulty level, it is a huge help.",1.0,1.0,/r/GodofWarRagnarok/comments/1aq6js3/any_use_for_such_a_high_defense/kqdd7zd/,"Defense is the stat that allows Kratos to take more hits before dying essentially.
