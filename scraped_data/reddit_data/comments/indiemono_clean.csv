1) mostly add 20-80 tracks per playlist.
2) Make sure you have similar group of BPM (like 60-100, 80- 120). in short, don't add one track which is very fast and other very slow in speed. It will boost your algorithm
3) Be on submithub, indiemono, etc. They are services where most musical artists cones to promote there new songs. Your playlist can skyrocket if someone get viral from your playlist. Also, you can do pay for playlist campaign if you got organic reach.
4) Don't add single artist over and over. It not only kills Spotify algorithm but also make Spotify think that you are bot.

first of all, two pointers mentioned above I'd love to back down -&gt;

2. College radios - it works!! check [this podcast](https://songtalk.ca/shows/college-radio-how-do-i-get-my-music-played/) about submitting to them.

Second, I'd scout the web for more independent playlist curators - some of these playlists have a serious following and there are a lot playlisters out there that are not on SubmitHub.

* [MySphera](https://www.mysphera.co/our-curators/) / [Musicto](https://www.musicto.com/) / [indiemono](https://indiemono.com/) \- sites with free submissions options.

Here are a few personal recommendations;

1. [MySphera](https://mysphera.co/submit-your-music) \-  They match your music with independent playlist curators for you (plus allow to submit directly to their curators for free).

2. [SoundPlate](https://soundplate.com) / [IndieMono](http://indiemono.com) Both sites offer free submissions to their playlists, despite having low acceptance and being a bit time consuming (you'll have to follow each playlist etc) they might provide great value.

3. A nice trick for me is hitting the [Spotify community's playlist exchange](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Playlist-Exchange), a lot of playlist makers exchange music there a great way to pitch your music directly to them :)

* Indiemono and Soundplate both offer ways to submit to some small/medium playlists
* Pay for a marketing firm to pitch your track to independent playlist curators (this is by far the most expensive method, but will give you the most ROI - providing your track is actually worth pitching)

There is a way to submit tracks to the Official Spotify Electronic playlists - via a Google form, can't find the link right now but will have a hunt through my emails. You do have to submit your track a good 3-4 weeks before release though, as I expect they get a TON of submissions.
