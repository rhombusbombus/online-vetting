There are different ones with each having slight variations but the two I use are:

Submithub and moonstrive.

Submit hub allows you to search and find curators based on various parameters.

Then you pay to send them one of your songs for consideration.

They will review it and either add it or send you a few words as to why they didn't. The reviews are pointless for a ton of reasons so I largely ignore them. From playlists you get put on you'll get a few hundred listens.

Moonstrive is a little different.

You send them your tune and they find playlists for you. The size of the playlists are based on how you pay. For the cheapest amount you go on lists with about 50K listeners or so.

From that you can get anywhere from a few thousand to several thousand listens. 

Here's the thing.

It's all bullshit.

It's hard to measure the success of it because people generally don't stop what they're doing and go find a band that came on that they liked and suddenly add them, buy their music etc..

The best metric I can gauge is wether they saved the song or added it to their personal playlists. 

For that, I'm seeing about a 10% conversion.

So, for every thousand that hear it, about 100 add it to their personal playlist or save it.

Pro music marketers would tell you you're wasting your money because the relationship is transactional and you're not building a fan base and you're not able to measure the metrics truly. This is hard to argue but for people, like myself, who have the money and would rather skin myself with a rusty carrot peeler than create social media content... it's the only other game in town, that I know about.

Hope this helps.

**Playlist placement**

There's a ton of ways of doing this from submitting directly to Spotify editorial lists, by paying to get them placed with sites like submithub or Moonstrive or by simply finding people who have good playlists and flat out asking them to put your songs on it.

From my experience this will get you some listens and some saves (to their playlists) but it only counts for the song you get placed. For example I got over 1200 streams on one song from about 5 playlists and that amounted to being added to about 100 individuals playlists. So if that holds true you're at about 12%. Doesn't seem like they listened to any other songs on my Spotify and if so not to any meaningful amount.

The benefit of this is, if you choose the right placement, your music will be heard and won't be sitting in the dark languishing in obscurity. Are the listeners super engaged? Probably not. They may have heard you song sandwiched between Billy Eilish and Taylor Swift...but they heard it and if they added it to their playlist or saved it... they liked it. That means a lot to me and all I care about. The bad part of this is that it will likely cost you and you're not really getting a true fan out of it. 

**Social Road**

You know what to do. 

Build up social media presence on TikTok, IG, FB, or likely all of them. You post interesting content, you spend time adding people who might be interested in hopes that add you back. You create engaging content. Long story short, you have to be a multi media agency in some ways. Music videos, pics, shit like that. You've seen enough of them to know what people want to see. If not, go check out your favorite artists socials... now do that.

Once you have the accounts and some content you create a landing page (google how to do it for music). This is simply a web page that you can use tracking on. All it does is link people to YT, Spotify or Apple Music... wherever you want to get your listens from.

Now you run ads from IG or FB to that page. You track the metrics and adjust. Retarget people and modify so that you're pitching the right stuff to the right audience. You are basically creating a business but instead of selling T-shirts or weight loss pills, you're selling your music. 

It's the same thing.

The same process.

The same funnels.   


Go search fitness supplements or something like that on FB and click on one of the ads. See what it does, that's what you have to do... more or less.

Grind that, and overtime you'll presumably build up enough of a following and fanbase to attract the attention of a label and/or be able to sell products to. Interact with them, have contests all the shit large acts do but on a smaller scale.

It's a grind, and it's 100% a job. If you get any success people will want to do it for you for free. Use them, pay them if you can. Rinse and repeat.

To me, it's very disheartening because writing and producing music is daunting enough (on top of everything we all have going on in our personal lives) so the thought of having to also be a marketing and social media expert is disappointing especially since I absolutely fucking loathe social media and everything about it. 

BUT if you learn it and grind it it can work... and it is the landscape as of this writing.

Now inevitably someone will reply with ""My friends cousin's pet goose doesn't do any of that and he gets 1 billion streams an hour on Spotify so you're full of shit""

So...None of this is to say you can't write an absolutely banger of a tune. The bust out hit of the summer of 2023..., put it on TikTiok or YT and get 1 trillion views over night. That can happen... or some variation of it.

But that's the equivalent of winning the lottery... or at the very least that one friend you heard about who graduated from college and applied for a job and got offered CEO position for $300K a year with Natalie Portman lookalike as his assistant. Sure it happens but not to anyone I know.

There's a guy who is pretty active on these boards, his name is Jesse David Lacey and he's very knowledgable about this shit. He's also a musician who has been through it himself. 

He sells a service where he does or at least helps you set up all of this. He also posts a lot of content and helpful shit so look him up. There's another guy as well who does that stuff but IDK him. I've spoken to Jesse and he seems legit and very nice.

If you're serious I'd suggest you find him and have a call to discuss if he can help you guys out.

If you do nothing you will be placing a single book into a library. 

The chances of someone stumbling upon your songs on spotify are about as good as someone finding that random book among all the stacks on all the floors of a city library... it's not good. 

Your music will get exactly the number of streams that you and your family/friends are able to give it.
