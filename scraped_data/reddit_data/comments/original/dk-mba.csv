Real improvements take time to evaluate, implement, and measure.  A 1/week requirement is just going to deluge you with makework responses, and effectively adds another ""boss.""  From the employee's perspective, it's probably just bullshit that the boss's boss's boss needs to justify a raise so he can afford more cocaine n' hookers before laying off 10% of the company to make the quarter's financials look better.  Unless they've got equity in the company, employees are (mostly) not going to care about the success of the business as a metric.

It's also a perverse incentive.  It's the equivalent of requiring a certain number of lines of code per week in software, or a certain number of emails / calls made in sales.  Those metrics don't earn the company money or improve the work experience of your employees.  Quite the opposite, in fact.  To meet those metrics you'd have programmers fudging the programming to take as many lines of code as possible, or the salesperson to get through the calls as fast as possible instead of focusing on closing a deal.

I see a lot of MBA types demand Lean implementation without understanding it or properly supporting it.  It's treated like a mystical talisman, shielding against wasteful practices, instead of a systemic change that must be supported.

Questions to ask:

1) What has Lean done for the company over the last couple years?  Are there any successes **that affect the employees positively** that you can point to?  If not... it's a pretty clear sign that the organization isn't doing things correctly, and there's a fundamental breakdown in the system somewhere.

2) Do your employees ***actually*** have the time and resources to do Lean activities?  Akers' organization specifically set aside time daily and empowered the employees.  What the Powers That Be might see as an opportunity, the employees might see as another demand on their time when they're already struggling to keep up with their normal workload.

I've seen a lot of organizations think they're ""running lean"" when they're actually starving, particularly since 2020.  It's unreasonable to add still more work onto someone already fitting 45 hours of work into a 40 hour week.  A drowning person can't build a life preserver, they can only focus on treading water.

3) How do you measure success?  As above, a 1/week metric is... bad.  I'm not sure what industry you're in, but things like more parts produced, scrap reduction, software speed / size,  etc. are much better.  Those help the business in tangible ways.",[],,0.0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gonna add to the chorus of &amp;quot;1 a week is bad.&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

Akers&amp;#39; organization specifically set aside time daily and empowered the employees.  What the Powers That Be might see as an opportunity, the employees might see as another demand on their time when they&amp;#39;re already struggling to keep up with their normal workload.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of organizations think they&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;running lean&amp;quot; when they&amp;#39;re actually starving, particularly since 2020.  It&amp;#39;s unreasonable to add still more work onto someone already fitting 45 hours of work into a 40 hour week.  A drowning person can&amp;#39;t build a life preserver, they can only focus on treading water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) How do you measure success?  As above, a 1/week metric is... bad.  I&amp;#39;m not sure what industry you&amp;#39;re in, but things like more parts produced, scrap reduction, software speed / size,  etc. are much better.  Those help the business in tangible ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there will be intangible benefits- meeting very smart people from different industries, learning about latest market trends ( which may also give some new direction to your career) and simply having the chance to explore through internships and other projects. You have been through industry/function changes earlier. Who knows, you may find newer opportunities at b-school.&lt;/p&gt;

**It became clear that I needed a launchpad/means to pivot to actually land a good job** without a pay cut (sea-going O3 in San Diego made around $90K then); even going federal would have been a 25% drop. I knew a couple of other guys in my world who went MBA and did some research on grad degrees (focused on ROI), and the path was obvious. GMAT/app prep was pretty easy from my shore tour (desk job) and I was able to do campus visits and veteran events at a few of my targeted schools.

These were KEY. Extremely educational. If you are prepared and make a good impression, the students/admin will tell you the secret sauces for improving your app. For example: I had NO idea what I really wanted to do post-MBA, so I followed a consensus recommendation and was the most adamant Defense Contract Consulting prospect of all time. Learned that industry top to bottom. Also - at the time, Johnson gave guaranteed interviews to Vet Weekend attendees who had already applied. I knew face time was my key to getting past my weak numbers, so I made it happen (twice: regular visit coordinated through Veteran's Club and the official weekend).

Spread out my first round apps (CBS interviewed dinged, Tuck dinged, Johnson in with $$$, didn't submit Foster safety R2 app) and called it a day. It was unlikely I'd find a better result and I really dug Johnson (being from the northeast helped).

Once it all got started, I knew what I *didn't* want to do: consulting (not about that hotel life) or banking (after 3 deployments I was done with those hours; but now that my promoted buddies are getting $600K bonuses at Goldman I regret it a little). My focus landed squarely on Tech PM and GM LDPs. I ran the gauntlets for these, joined all of the relevant clubs (High Tech and AI) and used the MBA Veterans Conference to the max capacity: I left on Friday and had 3 internship offers Monday. **I took the one doing a tech role at a big-but-not-sexy manufacturing company, over a big name bank (correctly identified that it was a quota-filler internship without good prospects).

I actually recall last year Cornell had a higher % of consultants with higher salary than NYU, but I could be wrong.

One of the main things that's really soured for me in Lego discovering the adult community is the company realizing that they can be really financially successful by pandering to the wealthy fans with very expensive sets, most of which are sold, built, and then put behind glass, never to be touched or played with again.

I think of Stinky Pete from ""Toy Story 2"" a lot when I see all these posts with very expensive sets sitting behind glass.  You're basically just buying a trophy.  While I'm glad that so many people take enjoyment from that, I've always been and always shall be an MOC guy.

95% of the sets I have bought in my life I have built, and some have been displayed for a time, but eventually, everything gets broken down so that I can use those parts to make my dreams become a reality.

What bothers me about the expensive sets is that fewer are produced, which limits the number of times certain pieces in certain colors are going to be available.  Since they will also be in limited supply due to most people keeping the sets on display instead of parting them out, those pieces will subsequently command exorbitant prices on the after market.

I remember wanting the original flower stalks that first appeared in brown in the Target exclusive Bespin set, and of course, that set was already a huge draw for the figures, and the prices for that part on Bricklink were unjustifiable for me.

I am a Lego collector when it comes to parts.  The sets are great to build and I always love to learn new techniques from them, but my primary goal is making my own things, and so I want as many pieces in as many colors so that all the possibilities are at my fingertips.

If I'm going to blow 1K on something basically superfluous, I'd go to one of the sabersmiths online and get myself a stage combat-ready lightsaber.  At least that can provide me with an endless supply of childhood joy whenever it ignites.

The bonus is that I work from home 5 days a week now and maybe show up at the office twice a month.

&lt;p&gt;I would highly recommend doing your CFA or an MBA. It opens up a little more opportunity in the back office side (as in not client facing). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was working at the branch, I loved everything credit so I switched to a credit analyst role and I am absolutely loving it. The pay may be a little lower but the headache is gone. The stress is gone. Waking up and questioning whether I actually need a job doesn’t happen anymore. The bonus is that I work from home 5 days a week now and maybe show up at the office twice a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find a couple positions you’re interested in. Find some people who work in that position. Ask them about it, talk about it, qualifications and such. Tips and tricks! Apply to everything! Everywhere. Don’t bother staying loyal to one company because they will never be loyal to you. Don’t be scared to move to a small company, it’s how you progress. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

It all depends on the objectives of the person pursing Jobs.  

&gt;Look for young companies that have younger people in their 30's maybe 40's who are building a brand and building stature in their field. They are the new generation of job creators. Then bring what skills you have and learn their business and become a contributor. Look to the future, not with and expect that a degree with move you into some high rank based on the status of a degree label.

* *( I work with people who claim BS. and Various Master's Degrees and some with MBA, but some are not self starters to the level they think they are, which is unfortunate, as some are not willing to learn the system or the business objectives, before they come in and try to talk innovation. Unless ones bring some unique skills that can be readily applied, and in those cases, often, its likely the company will have their recruiters looking for people with such unique skills.)*

&gt;Many people who seek jobs, never read what the companies administrative procedures are, they don't read the HR rules and guidelines, and they don't know what exist in the city ordinance, which can have impact on what and how a company performs and what it can and can't do based on the Metropolitan Plan of zoning regulations. Research well the company, then one can construct their Resume as well as be better equipped to deal with the interviewers.

&gt;There are various 'cliques"" within companies, its important to learn the people, *read their Bio, learn what their area of responsibility is, so you better understand who you are dealing with and what you are dealing with.*

&gt;*Don't shape your Resume to overshadow the bosses whom you are seeking to hire you*\*\*\*!!!!\*\*\* *People are people and they will feel threatned and they will blot out anything they think threatens their jobs.*

&gt;

Young people hurt themselves in many ways, by expecting to come out of school, and immediately get a job that affords them things that people who have put in decades of work, have accumulated over time. 

They come out of schools and immediately the highest salary, they want the nice marquee vehicles, the status home, and the means to have exotic vacations and patronize the marquee establishment, and wear designer things and have all the leisure time they want.  

We see it everyday, they think the degree means they should drive a BMW. Lexus, Mercedes and be able to go shopping for every newest thing advertised.  They want to live like they are on a perpetual Spring Break at some fancy resort. 

I did briefings for new hires for 8 yrs,  and I told them, manage yourself and plan, everyone comes with dreams but don't expect them to suddenly materialize just because you just got hired.   Plan, develop a 5 yrs plan, then develop a longer range plan.  Don't expect the paycheck to immediately make all your dreams come true just because you are now working.     

I've seen many who come on a job, claiming they are self motivated and they can do this or that, and then after the first few pay checks, they are already talking about ""what they are not going to do, and talking about ""they don't pay me enough to do this or that""...  and some immediately start looking for another job, and they continue repeating that cycle and wondering why they are not building equity in their lives.  

I've seen people who have had 5-6 jobs over a two year or 3 yr span.    *No employer is excited about that***!!!!**    Every time they quite a job, they claim its the Job's fault.     They claim they should have advanced faster based on their own person ego. or the claim of a degree.     Employer's can see through people who are over hyped on themselves with exaggerated expectations, and expect immediate accolades.   The response to them within the interviewer ranks is generally, ""the employer does not feel they are good fit for the company"".   No company is eager to hire overly embellished ego's that border on arrogance, that goes far beyond a general sense of self confidence.  No employers is motivated to hire people who come in as if they are better than the people who are interviewing them. 



*Even the Chinese came to learn that a Degree and High Test Scores does not always translate to higher productivity in the workplace.*   

I've seen people who come into the workforce, and say, *""the real world of work, is nothing like what they taught us in school""*...

I’m 11 years older than you and this was me, minus no credit card debt as I had access to my parents’ card 😅. 

A few tips -

1) Instead of going cold turkey (budgeting shopping, facials, etc) - try to reduce the costs. So instead of seeing something and buying it online or in store, I now wait at least 24 hours. If I still am thinking about it and want it, then I’ll get it. Apply this to any purchase, even if it’a $25 as that adds up. As for hair, facials etc - try to space it out. The longer you space it out, the easier and easier it becomes. So instead of monthly facials, try every 6-8 weeks and then with life, it’ll slip to every 8-10 weeks. This is how I cut down my nail salon trips from weekly to now every 5 weeks or so (to the chagrin of my salon 😅)

2) This is a bit less conventional, but you are a balance sheet which means your profit is revenue (salary) minus costs (your shopping). To keep your costs similar, see if you can increase your salary. You’re still young - can you go to grad school, get promoted in your job, etc. I started at $65K back when I was your age and am much more than that, after a MBA and some job switches / promotions

No offence but your argument of when did you last follow traffic rules is bad, I follow most of them at most times but Yes I won't lie I do break them sometimes, mostly going on wrong side of the road to get to places quicker. This is not the point though, It's an uncivilized socitey, Everytime I go out i see people spitting on the streets, You take an uber the driver will be eating gutka and smelling like he hasn't taken a shower in the last 10 years.

Other countries get so much for their taxes, The number one thing they get is good infrastructure, there's so many more things I can name, now ofcourse no country is Paradis and every place has their problems, For example public healthcare in canada is shit, Gun laws might be a problem in USA so it's upto you to make an informed decesion. My taxes are being used to fund freebie schemes, E
Relegious intolerance, some uneducated minister out there is enjoying with my taxes, Is corruption not rampant in other countries? It definitely is, but nowhere close to in India.

Coming on to cost of living, you need to understand that cost of living isn't cheap in india either, look at the rent in mumbai(most jobs after mba will be here) I can write an entire essay on this but just compare the rents to someplace in london and it's not far off, Only difference your salary will generally be 5-10x higher in those countries. Also the only cheap products are the ones made in India, most of them are poor quality and shit, Want an iPhone? You're probably paying 1.5x it's cost, Want a good car? Be happy with the trash tata and mahindra keep bringing out, Because getting an actual good car is next to impossible in this country, look at the tarrifs, And let's even say you get into rich class and buy a ferrari, chalaoge kidhar bhai? 

Pharmaceutical industry is good, I'll give you that, coming onto food, yes it's cheap but look at how unhealthy and unhygienic indian food is, Little to no protien extremely high amount of bad carbs, saturated fats, trans fats etc. not to mention it's almost impossible to get good quality meat and eggs here(they become very expensive) the ones that are sold are fulll of pesticides andother things that are bad for your body. This is admittedly a problem in America as well but most European countries have it good in this regard.

I can go on about so many other things but the last one is pollution, You are actively destroying your lungs by living in this country, You might die a lot quicker.

Huh? I'm a director at a F250 - myself and all my peers have, at minimum a MS or MBA. I dont know a single large company where you will make it in a senior leadership position without some advanced degree.

But overall, the way you 'stand out' against someone with a PhD or MS is to play on your turff. As someone who is very green (BS and 3yo wont even meet basic quals for a DS at many companies)....you should not be going for the same job the tenured DS with a phd is going for.

&gt; I took a huge amount of categorical data and I split it out using Python, grouped it into tokens, created word clouds and other sentiment related data for it. So I think this is a literal function of data science, if I do say so myself. I also created a lightweight machine learning model to make predictions. It was based on TensorFlow, but I also tested with XG boost as well. Like to think that this was a data science function too

You are missing what data science is. Data science is not word clouds or xgboost. Its not regression or statistics. Its not committing code to git. At the end of the day data science is about adding value to an org by creating change through data.

&gt; In terms of getting actual titled data scientist roles however, I keep hearing the same thing. You're going to have a hard time if you don't have a PhD, no one will take you seriously, 

No one says this, and if they do they are just talking out their ass. There are tons (I would bet the majority) of DS without phds. Only about 10% of my employees have phds, however 90% still have an advanced degree (MBA, MS, phd) of some descriptions.

The major issue currently going on is the issue of VISAs. I know more clarity on US, so gonna throw more light on it. Once you get admitted for your graduate study in the US, you will issued F1 Student VISA on which you are eligible to study and work part-time within the campus premises. Post graduation, you need to get a job within 3 months (many use a loophole to extend to 1 year working as a volunteer).

Title: My tryst with CAT ( General Engineer Male POV)  
Body:  

Profile: GEM (24 yo)  
My qualifications: 10th: 9.6 CGPA, 12th: 91, B.Tech (Mech): 9.35 CGPA  
20 months of work experience in Technology consulting space (still working)  
  
2022: Building Blocks  
The story starts when I was in my penultimate year of undergrad and was sure that I do not want to work in the core mechanical engineering sector. So, the next obvious step was to explore other avenues and that is when data science caught my eye. So I honed my skills and took an off campus job in the same domain. This was in Jan 2022. I was enjoying my work there but it was around September that I realized the scope of impact business consultants and product managers made to a project. I was quite intrigued by their work - began researching and that is when I realized the next step for me to get into Product roles, has to be an MBA from a Tier-1 insti. Started preparing for CAT alongside my job. Prepped for around 1.5 months and scored 92.38 percentile.  
Got only CAP calls, had applied nowhere else. Converted none.  
  
2023: The sprint  
I knew that given an ample amount of time, I should be able to score a good percentile in CAT. Started prep from April, enrolled in a test series, purchased Arun Sharma's books , solved the problems diligently. For VARC, I made a habit to read newspaper for half an hour before office and made sure to solve and analyze at least 1 RC per day. Similarly for LRDI, I solved 1 set per day. I practiced QA on weekends as that was my strongest suit. The targets I set for myself were quite attainable.  
Of course I increased the number (of RCs and LRDI puzzled) to 5-7 per day as the CAT approached.  
Meanwhile my job got pretty hectic as I was promoted to senior position within the company and this took a toll on my prep. Took a week leave from work before CAT (which was quite necessary).  
Got a percentile of 98.29 with a meagre 64.xx percentile in LRDI.  
XAT - 97.453x (all sectionals cleared)  
Didn't qualify for CAP, SPJIMR, IITB, IITD. BLACKISM was out of question given the scenario this year (especially being a GEM). Converted IMT-G's PGDM core and will probably convert XIMB as well. XLRI(BM) interview didn't go as expected. I have a call from IIFT which to be frank is my best bet at the moment.  
If I don't convert IIFT (Delhi) or XLRI(BM) this year I will probably repeat and take my last shot at CAT this year with an aim of getting into BLACKISM, SPJIMR, FMS. Will take GMAT as well for ISB. Cannot settle for anything less.

You can argue clothing doesn't matter but it's basic respect when you're talking about interviewing for a job.  Not expecting a suit... or even a dress shirt.  But a pair of khakis and a solo?   Apparently too much.  


Most have poor experience and no education outside a HS diploma.  But considering the roles, it's not necessary to have more than that.  The thing is, they all say the right things.  They are hungry for hours.  They have no issue working outside in the elements and just want a shot at working for our company because it's a good place to move up in their career.  


90% are full of shit.  They don't follow directions.  They refuse to follow their routes.  They complain.  Refuse to work required hours.  No show all the time. Are just all around insubordinate.  My managers do a fairly good job supervising them and coaching them, but the employees just don't care.  And there's very little we can do.  


Every warning we give them has to be approved by an HR rep who lives 800 miles away.  She always sides with caution due to fear of lawsuits.

Never mind him bragging about shooting at her place. 


They eventually fired him and we then found out he convicted of rape and attempted murder 15 years ago and got out of the joint 8 years ago.  So they missed this on his 7 year background check.  It was awesome having armed guards at my location for a month due to him making threats at me and my family.

Consider looking beyond just the elite schools to programs that might be more ""splitter-friendly"" (i.e. more holistically evaluative vs. fixated on stats) and also align with your career objectives. An MBA is a major investment, so fit and affordability are key.

Definitely look into MBA scholarships, employer sponsorship, and other funding options to help with costs if you're concerned about debt. There may be more possibilities than you think to make it feasible.

Title: 31-year-old, B.Tech IT grad (2015 passed out) and working professional in an unrelated field. Should I follow my family's advice for MBA or pursue a PGDM for the practical knowledge?  
Body:  

**1. Background:**   
**1.1 Education/work/myquals:**   
Joined btech 2010. Passed out in 2015 instead of 2014(backlogs that continued due to medical reasons - SLE) and 3 year gap from 2015-2018 dec due to same and still hate the drugs.  
*Work exp*: 2018 Dec joined a small private publication company completely unrelated to my field, had one promotion that feels like a namesake (just had 'sr.' added before job title) still working there for low salary even though dont think experience will translate much anywhere and hardly any growth career wise.   
  
**1.2.** 31 years old M, don't have much hope for CAT quants despite practice and can't afford to have anymore gaps at this age. 12th math passed only thru re-evaluation and college m2 had it as arrear from 2nd sem till 1 year extra &amp; that too was through re-evaluation. Tried bank exams for 5 years, and always missed quant cutoff in prelims/mains.  
  
**1.3 Academics:** 

* 10th/12th/Btech IT : 78.4/66.25/67.5%
* MAT:  
overall: 97.86 percentile or 739.5 score, Quants: 68.82 percentile or 54.37 score, 
* XAT:  
overall: 60th percentile or 17.333 percentage, Quants: 20th percentile with negative markings or -5.3.
* TANCET: awaiting website but not much hope.

  
*Colleges looked into:*  
Thought of Firebird Coimbatore, XIME Chennai(applied) or Woxsen Hyderabad among others.  
The negative 1\* reviews for available colleges based on age/academics are also off-putting. Some have about improper scheduling of semester exams(NSB, Blr.), some mention faculty attrition affecting education quality(Christ Univ. Blr. &amp; St. Joesph Blr), many mention that they hound you for admission/fees and no response after that, some mention having to put positive reviews on quora/google/fb to get internal marks, couple are mention worse things students try due to pressure!!!  
  
***2.*** ***Question******:***  
Family wants me to get second degree either Mtech or MBA.   
Didn't want repeat of engineering &amp; read negative things about MBA grads remaining unemployed. So wanted to go for PGDM since it boils down to more updated &amp; practical knowledge about management &amp; also hoping this will allow me to shift fields.  
Converted NSB bangalore but while it is AICTE approved, it doesnt have NBA accreditation so didnt go for it.   
  
Now I learnt that PGDM is not equivalent to MBA degree unless it has AIU equivalence which leaves with lesser college options than MBA.   
Should I still go for PGDM or just go for MBA?   
p.s. Any other suggestions for colleges for either degrees in T.N/Andhra? the negative reviews on google maps are seriously screwing up my perspective and now I'm scared that whole thing is just a money looting machine.

IIM A-99+ the 10 th cutoff would be borderline but definitely achievable 

IIM B-99.4+ the best college at your profile highly concentrated with workex people and consulting heaven this should be your aim 

IIM C-99.2+ you score full marks on the profile in 10/12 and gender it doesn't consider grad scores so the most achievable of the holy trinity

IIM L- 99.3+ with the 12th marks score being zero due to normalisation in IIM L getting a call and conversion is harder than IIM C

IIM K-96+ the most achievable of the old IIMs with high gender diversity score in the selection criteria IIM K would be great for people aiming a career in marketing

IIM I- 99+ with gargantuan weightage on 10th IIM I is one of the shittest IIMs in India with a batch of 800+ and a 20% decline in placements this year this is the Least preferred old IIM 

SPJIMR- 93+ with all sections cleared one of the best private colleges with high regards to workex and gender diversity this is another gem you can Target at

IIM Mumbai- the newest IIM in town will fetch a call at 97+ and then if you're interested in operations this is the mecca for other streams it'll take time to shed its image

XLRI- once you clear 96 in XAT it boils down to the interviews

IIM A-99+ the 10 th cutoff would be borderline but definitely achievable &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IIM B-99.4+ the best college at your profile highly concentrated with workex people and consulting heaven this should be your aim &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IIM C-99.2+ you score full marks on the profile in 10/12 and gender it doesn&amp;#39;t consider grad scores so the most achievable of the holy trinity&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IIM L- 99.3+ with the 12th marks score being zero due to normalisation in IIM L getting a call and conversion is harder than IIM C&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IIM K-96+ the most achievable of the old IIMs with high gender diversity score in the selection criteria IIM K would be great for people aiming a career in marketing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IIM I- 99+ with gargantuan weightage on 10th IIM I is one of the shittest IIMs in India with a batch of 800+ and a 20% decline in placements this year this is the Least preferred old IIM &lt;/p&gt;

The book has changed my perspective towards life. I agree there are pros &amp; cons to country. I am looking to pursue MBA but very ambitious about cracking the top 1% jobs. Here comes reality, my acads won't get me shortlisted for top MBA colleges, even if I go I won't get the best jobs like consulting or Finance. Secondly, number of high finance &amp; consulting roles are very limited in India.( Someone will argue for sure). So what's my take on this ?. 
I decided to get serious about my career very early from during my undergrad. I decided to take up cfa, some nptel courses, CAIA. Paid to a company which offers off campus placements &amp; internships. Preparing for GMAT. If I have to do job forver in consulting or IB, I will prefer a place that's actually good for me. I know in India even if you are from top college ite hard to get into one. But compared to Singapore, US, London there are plenty of high finance jobs there. I know presently recession is going out there but let's look into long run. I can learn best of the practices out there &amp; implement here if someday I want to come back. 

Often I have felt that India is a shitty place to live but as I am growing i understand no country is all heaven. India is a growth engine . Good for certain kind of startups &amp; businesses. It's one of the reason I really plan to come back. But again I feel it is a trap. For last some decades this has been a bait given to Indian students. Don't go abroad because India is growing but the real question is your growth here ? From job perspective I don't see much future for quality jobs, also I don't want to be a fucking back office employee after so many years of slogging &amp; studying like a nerd. So you go where your growth is there. 

One another aspect is even if you become top 1% in India the basic quality of life is shit in India. You have to pay to be in gated society that provides the most basic amenities of life in a good condition. You have to earn in rupee &amp; spend in dollars because luxury is taxed here heavily. If you are not rich the public institutions doesn't care a lot. Health care is good but again only private healthcare. So you have to think hard as in what's best for you. Also, we have this tendency of being medicore at things. For education, I feel couple of IITs &amp; IIMs don't work. It will give you world leading ceos but don't create innovation or culture of entrepreneurship in India like us. Work life balance is shit too. Personal time is seen as haram in India. A employee is meant to do personal task of boss. Also, you can't say no because again ther are 100 out there to replace you. Replacing in India is easy as buying gun in Pakistan. ( Sorry for over exaggeration). Also, we pretend a lot like we follow Indian culture but we all want to be westerners. Indians want to be Americans &amp; Europeans but they fail to become even Indian. At last we are bigger racist then anyone. Every community is rscist towards another. Let's be honest we all have joke for another community. I always wanted to go to Gujarat &amp; learn doing business but i got to know how much getting rent in Gujarat is dependent on your background, caste. ( Only talking about cities like ahemdabad, vadodra). Bangalore has kannada issue. Delhi is again a whole fucking Gangsta culture or let's say they are culture less. I can go on. I have lived in major metro cities due to my dad's job &amp; I can say this from experience. I was lucky enough to get good people everywhere but you judge a place what majority of crowd is doing. Just let me defend one thing related to US high school shootout. US has a gun culture issue but is it like every other high school attacked by bunch of kids with AK 47. Is India completely poor ? But does only gurugram represent India. Yes I am complaining about India a lot. Yes, I have issues. It's my country &amp; i really want it to improve. But also, if it has to change it will. People in democracy like India can't do much. Masses are illiterate in intellectual terms. You can be a topper of IIT &amp; still get manipulated by media. It's not your or my fault.. present day media &amp; MNC are the real king. To become a superpower India needs power in terms of narrative &amp; economy. But even after this will our life change. My dad has worked entire life but now the road that comes to our  house gets our of shape every other monsoon. If someone takes over my property tommorw my dad will need to sit outside a local mla office to help. Is this worth it after paying so much in taxes.

End of rant.",[],,0.0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well I am reading a nomad capitalists &amp;amp; there is an opening line “go where you are treated nice”. The book has changed my perspective towards life. I agree there are pros &amp;amp; cons to country. I am looking to pursue MBA but very ambitious about cracking the top 1% jobs. Here comes reality, my acads won&amp;#39;t get me shortlisted for top MBA colleges, even if I go I won&amp;#39;t get the best jobs like consulting or Finance. Secondly, number of high finance &amp;amp; consulting roles are very limited in India.( Someone will argue for sure). So what&amp;#39;s my take on this ?. 
I decided to get serious about my career very early from during my undergrad. I decided to take up cfa, some nptel courses, CAIA. Paid to a company which offers off campus placements &amp;amp; internships. Preparing for GMAT. If I have to do job forver in consulting or IB, I will prefer a place that&amp;#39;s actually good for me. I know in India even if you are from top college ite hard to get into one. But compared to Singapore, US, London there are plenty of high finance jobs there. I know presently recession is going out there but let&amp;#39;s look into long run. I can learn best of the practices out there &amp;amp; implement here if someday I want to come back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often I have felt that India is a shitty place to live but as I am growing i understand no country is all heaven. India is a growth engine . Good for certain kind of startups &amp;amp; businesses. It&amp;#39;s one of the reason I really plan to come back. But again I feel it is a trap. For last some decades this has been a bait given to Indian students. Don&amp;#39;t go abroad because India is growing but the real question is your growth here ? From job perspective I don&amp;#39;t see much future for quality jobs, also I don&amp;#39;t want to be a fucking back office employee after so many years of slogging &amp;amp; studying like a nerd. So you go where your growth is there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One another aspect is even if you become top 1% in India the basic quality of life is shit in India.

Go look at job postings for 10 companies you think you'd love to work for this weekend. Find your dream job at those companies. Read the requirements. Write them all down --degree, certificates, years of experience, skills needed, whatever. I'd bet a DoorDash lunch that \*most of them\* do not ""MS/BS in Cybersecurity"" as their preferred degree in the requirements section.

For example, \[THIS one\](https://www.google.com/about/careers/applications/jobs/results/106744532541809350-senior-ir-consultant) ; a senior cybersecurity position at arguably the most reputable IR firm in America.

Now, that doesn't mean that an MS in Cybersec is worthless, right. If someone doesn't know the fundamentals they might by the time they graduate a program. If you self-identify your weakness as being not convincingly fluent in subject matter expert language, it might help. 

But you're asking the wrong question. The question you should be asking is ""What is the best thing that I can do over the next 1-2 years to put me on the path to the dream job?""

I am pretty certain that when you finish this homework assignment, all or nearly all of the job postings will specifically ask for a Computer Science degree. Not Cybersecurity. Not some half-ass ""Informatics"" or ""Information Technology"" or ""Managed Information Systems"" or whatever people take these days to avoid math class. 

Employers almost universally will specifically ask for Computer Science. There are \[exceptions\](https://www.google.com/about/careers/applications/jobs/results/142125457903362758-senior-incident-response-consultant-mandiant-google-cloud) where they might ask for Cybersec, but those are exceptions. And they still asked for Comp Sci. 

Employers almost universally \*will never ask for a Master's degree.\* No one gives a shit about Master's degrees. Master's degrees to employers do not mean more experience or better candidate, with few exceptions (MBA, for example). They mostly mean ""student was not able to get the job they wanted with an undergraduate degree because of degree choice, performance, maturity, or job market.""

If you already have a CS or close-enough undergrad AND 5 years of experience in as a SOC analyst, you are already a baller.  I think you're far better off putting that money towards certifications (like those found in the second career link at Mandiant I provided, OR ones that you come across while doing this little dream-job requirements homework assignment you didn't ask for ;) ).

Personally I learned more from each of my SANS/GIAC certifications than any 2 years I spent in college, and while SANS is expensive, it's far less expensive than a Masters and will do far more to help meet the requirements for the best jobs in cybersecurity. For alternatives to SANS, you should look up the DOD 8140 matrix, which lists lots of different types of jobs in cyber and what certificates the government is looking for in candidates. Even though I expect you are aiming for the private sector, this policy is widely adopted by private sector and you will see the certs in 8140 all over your dream-job-requirements research. And yes, these certificates will be challenging and help with technical fluency when talking to other experts.

It is always going to very hard for a non-citizen to beat a citizen for a position, you really have to be a much better applicant (or cheaper) to be worth the hassle for the employer. With the best certs in the industry I think you will have a much better shot than being just another guy with a MS.

On the MBA. So many people just get an MBA.   Its value depends on where you got it and what you did while getting it.  In other words, it’s not a great idea to get an MBA unless you are pivoting or the level you are to be promoted to requires it.  

You ideally get it, then do internships in the industry you are pivoting towards.  If it is for promotion’s sake, then the level needs to be worth it.  You do not need an MBA to be a manager, but for director/Sr Director/and up not having one might be a roadblock industry depending.  You are already working on a masters, so the box is mostly checked for your current industry.

The thing is that there MANY factors that go into your application, and a huge portion is luck. Maybe if I could give some better advice (as someone who is further along in the application experience, so get other opinions as well) it would be this:

1) There is no magical formula. Generally you want at least 2 years of work experience, but 4-6 is better.

I'll try not to be biased but I think in general if you want Tech Entrepreneurship, you should pick Cambridge, compared to Oxford being better for Finance. Having discussed with some of my friends at Oxford, here are my insights between the two programs:

* Academics: Cambridge is a bit more intensive, we take 8-9 classes a term + a project that is either a consulting or concentration project. The Oxford curriculum is seemingly more flexible/lax, but lots of optional things for you to join such as Finance Lab and Creative Destruction Lab, or even attend other matters (take care of your family, work part time, job search). Really depends on what you want.
* Concentration and Electives: I chose Cambridge because of their Concentrations, such as the Entrepreneurship Concentration that I have heard good things about. I believe Cambridge curriculum allows you to select more electives during the term than Oxford as well. It is good that Oxford is starting to follow Cambridge as well, but definitely some uncertainty on how well it will be executed during the early stages.
* Alumni Network: Not as big as a difference as you think, I've messaged Oxford MBA alumni on Linkedin for coffee chats, you can see it more as an Oxbridge network/family rather than each school on its own. I'd also help out an Oxford MBA if they reached out to me on Linkedin.
* Adcom Experience: I personally enjoyed Cambridge's more, but honestly makes no difference once you get here. There's limited interaction with them so far this year after getting in. Glad to see you had a great time with Oxford, shows they are improving here as well.
* College Experience: Very similar, the college system is unique to Oxbridge that you won't get anywhere else. Make sure you research colleges, I didn't realize that it can really affect your experience here. You can start by looking at the academic rankings and net assets of a college as a benchmark. King's College in Cambridge known for its Entrepreneurship Lab also likes to accept entrepreneurs/aspiring entrepreneurs. 
* Cost: Not only does Cambridge have cheaper tuition, the city itself a bit cheaper. Queens' College in Cambridge also serves quality meals for 3 pounds that my Oxford MBA friends were shocked to find when they visited.

By the time you finish your MBA, the market should be in a much better place and I think it&amp;#39;ll be a lot easier to find a position. Plus, if you plan to go institutional, MBA wouldn&amp;#39;t do any harm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just my two cents.&lt;/p&gt;

          My name is [Military Recruiter] and I’m with the US Army Medical Department. I just got a list with your MCAT score from 2021 (a lot of institutions get this info as well) which is why you’ve probably been getting spammed ever since you took it. I’m reaching out to share an opportunity with you regarding a full ride scholarship to Medical School through the Health Professions Scholarship Program (HPSP). I only have room for 5 more people. These individuals will not only receive 100% tuition, but they will also receive a $2,700+ monthly stipend and a $20,000 bonus to help with the additional cost of rent, food, and commute to school.

         This is my last call for current medical students or students entering medical school this fall. After this month, it will take too long to get your application approved in time to pay for school. We are slotting round 1 interviews now and I’d really appreciate the opportunity to talk with you about it more. Please contact me at your earliest convenience.


🤝 Let's Connect! 🤝

I have attached an informational flyer that gives an overview of some of the student programs we offer in Army Healthcare. Please take a look and reach out with any questions you may have. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to speaking with you.

 

If you’d like me to take you off my list, just let me know.

(MBA average salaries are around $120k and MA management average around $80K)

This also comes down to what your career goals are, a masters in management isn’t something that generally opens a lot of doors, especially when one already has a management degree and is a new grad. 

For the VAST majority of those who want to advance in the business field, they get a business undergrad, then work for 1-3 years, then go back to get an MBA which gives a large jump in progression. 

Getting the MBA/masters level credential before you have any experience at all generally does you very little good in the business world, MBA’s are also one of the degrees where it’s often worth getting into and fully paying for the most prestigious institution you can possibly get into,

&lt;p&gt;This also comes down to what your career goals are, a masters in management isn’t something that generally opens a lot of doors, especially when one already has a management degree and is a new grad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the VAST majority of those who want to advance in the business field, they get a business undergrad, then work for 1-3 years, then go back to get an MBA which gives a large jump in progression. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting the MBA/masters level credential before you have any experience at all generally does you very little good in the business world, MBA’s are also one of the degrees where it’s often worth getting into and fully paying for the most prestigious institution you can possibly get into, &lt;/p&gt;

If a potential employer cares that much about WHERE you went to school and you have experience in your field I would find that as a sign to keep it moving and especially in tech.... I have worked with some highly skilled fellow systems engineers | SREs and many did not have degrees and were just as skilled as me or our brick and mortar attended contemporaries.

It sort of sounds to me you have passedthe point of needing or benefitting from the CISSP.&lt;/p&gt;

2) Reach out to your fellow colleagues that have secured a job.

3) Talk to the Professors to see if there is anyone in their network that is recruiting.

4) Reach out to alumni on LinkedIn and chat with them.

5) Talk to the career services to see if they have anything that was recently posted or still actively recruiting.

6) Reach out to Hiring Managers / Recruiters directly on LinkedIn. Maybe get Premium for couple of months and send personalized InMails for target jobs (These are limited to send wisely).

7) Your own company. Looks like you work at a bank. Any reason you can't move internally maybe to a relationship Banker / Branch Manager / Or transition to a finance role? Leverage your company!

In terms of workload - I'm working as DevOps (mostly using scripting languages and terminal), and currently developing my own game using Unreal Engine 5. Also, I develop various electrical devices (programming\\flashing MCUs and designing parts for 3D printing).  
For games, I had PS5 and recently switched to PC, never used Mac for gaming, except of tinkering with Crossover to launch some old titles back when I didn't have PC.

At first, I've got Air. First impressions - screen is phenomenal, it's big, have nice colors and resolution. Enormous touchpad, nice keyboard. Downsides - when UE is compiling shaders, Air is overheating and the whole process for blank project initially takes 10-15 minutes (same amount of time as for M3 btw). Also, if you're planning to use external 4K screen, nice Type-C hub is a bit expensive.

Then I decided to build full fledged Windows PC, and gave MBA to my wife.

But, as I want my UE project to run on Apple devices (you must use their devices for building apps), and because of (for me) macOS is way more user-friendly in terms of UI-UX, I understood that I also need MacBook, so I went for Pro M3 14.

I feel a bit more confident as it have active cooling, and also having onboard HDMI port capable of 4K\\120Hz is very handy (on the other hand, using hub is also have sense, because you can connect your screen, USB devices, ethernet, charger to it and connect to Mac via just one Type-C cable, and with Pro, if you're not using hub, you must use few cables - separate HDMI on the right side and charger\\devices on the left).

In terms of performance, almost no difference between two (since my work tasks aren't performance demanding and I switched heavy stuff to PC). In terms of usability, 14 Pro is much more portable (although is thicker than Air). Screen is better, sure, it have miniLED array and 120 Hz, but actually it doesn't matter, since I'm using IDEs all the time. So the Pro have only two advantages over Air - portability and better cooling.

So, if you're planning to use your Mac for coding and scripting, not planning to do anything with game development, go for Air. Its passive cooling handles such workloads without problems. Also, bigger screen and touchpad is more convenient.

For anything more demanding, just to feel more secure, better get Pro for its active cooling.

I had refinanced once during the covid times since interest rates had dropped. Although there is no limit to times you can refinance, it doesn't guarantee lower interest rates, usually its for tenure extension, lowering monthly payment, which doesn't mean you're paying less at the end of the day.

500k is a big amount, and you should do some analysis on the ROI time to pay off the loan, alternatives in case you have to move back, etc.

I hope at least some of what follows is useful.

I won't bore you with career stories. What may be useful is that I realized early on that my love for recording music was so strong that it powered me through the financial uncertainties of that ""business"". What I failed to anticipate is the freewheeling lifestyle is fine for a single man but it can cause a lot of problems for a husband and father of three.

I was extremely lucky to marry a wonderful woman, a musician, who understood my obsession and tolerated the ""feast or famine"" cash flow of the recording business. After 43 years of marriage I can tell you that I love her with intense passion and absolute devotion. She is all joy and light and goodness and love in my life. Without her I would have failed.

I sometimes cast a jealous eye at my other friends who had 9 - 5 jobs. They had regular hours, a steady paycheck, weekends off, paid holidays, and health insurance. I had none of the above. Please believe me when I tell you that health insurance is a very important benefit. In our 30s we paid $400 - $600 per month to insure our family. By the time I turned 64 I was paying $1,500 per month just for me and my wife's premium was $1,300 per month. Imagine my joy when we went on Medicare. Now we each pay $300 per month.

Call your elected representatives and tell them to implement Medicare for all. I'm positive that the total cost to We The People would be less than the current system which protects profits instead of people.

Meanwhile, my friends envied what they perceived as the freedom to be the boss and make my own hours. Anyone running a small business will tell you that being the boss means you get to work far more hours than anyone else. The upside is that building a small but successful business has been very satisfying. My advice to anyone considering starting a business is to (duh!) take some business classes. You don't need an MBA but pursuing a passion only works if you know how to stay in business!

  backup of your post content: 

  I'm thrilled to share that I've been admitted to Wharton's MBA program but I am currently navigating the financing this dream without scholarship support. I'm exploring all avenues to fund the $160,000 tuition in a way that's financially sustainable in the long run, aiming to keep my total repayment under $300,000 (ideally $250,000).

  
My quotes from Prodigy and MPower are astronomically high, projecting over $600,000 for the two years, which is far beyond my comfort zone. I'm desperately looking for ways to bring it down to a more manageable $500,000 total, with the aim of refinancing later.

  
I have resources to cover living expenses and some of the tuition through internship earnings, but securing a loan for the rest at a fair interest rate is proving to be a hurdle. My recent transition from a FAANG company to freelancing is adding a twist to the loan application process. Not sure if it's affecting how lenders view my employment status, so any advice on this would be great.  
I'm reaching out for insights and experiences on the following:

  
Specific Loan Refinancing Companies:  
I've heard about Sofi and Earnest among others. Are these companies accommodating to international MBA students? Are there any other lenders you'd recommend?  
Any tips on getting initial quotes from Prodigy and MPower as low as possible?

  
Ease of Approval:  
What was your visa status when you applied, and how did it affect your application?  
Were you employed, unemployed, or self-employed? How did this impact your approval chances?

  
Did you require a cosigner?  
Had you built any credit in the US before approval? What did you do to build it?

  
Interest Rates and Repayment:  
What interest rates were you able to secure, and how does it compare to initial quotes?  
How much were you able to reduce your total debt or monthly payments by refinancing?

  
Fixed vs. Variable Rates:  
Experiences with choosing between fixed and variable rates, especially considering the long-term implications of each choice for international students?

  
Any shared experiences or advice would be immensely valuable. Thank you in advance for your time and help!

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m thrilled to share that I&amp;#39;ve been admitted to Wharton&amp;#39;s MBA program but I am currently navigating the financing this dream without scholarship support. I&amp;#39;m exploring all avenues to fund the $160,000 tuition in a way that&amp;#39;s financially sustainable in the long run, aiming to keep my total repayment under $300,000 (ideally $250,000).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My quotes from Prodigy and MPower are astronomically high, projecting over $600,000 for the two years, which is far beyond my comfort zone. I&amp;#39;m desperately looking for ways to bring it down to a more manageable $500,000 total, with the aim of refinancing later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have resources to cover living expenses and some of the tuition through internship earnings, but securing a loan for the rest at a fair interest rate is proving to be a hurdle. My recent transition from a FAANG company to freelancing is adding a twist to the loan application process. Not sure if it&amp;#39;s affecting how lenders view my employment status, so any advice on this would be great.&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;m reaching out for insights and experiences on the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific Loan Refinancing Companies:&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve heard about Sofi and Earnest among others. Are these companies accommodating to international MBA students? Are there any other lenders you&amp;#39;d recommend?&lt;br/&gt;
Any tips on getting initial quotes from Prodigy and MPower as low as possible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ease of Approval:&lt;br/&gt;
What was your visa status when you applied, and how did it affect your application?&lt;br/&gt;
Were you employed, unemployed, or self-employed? How did this impact your approval chances?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you require a cosigner?&lt;br/&gt;
Had you built any credit in the US before approval? What did you do to build it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interest Rates and Repayment:&lt;br/&gt;
What interest rates were you able to secure, and how does it compare to initial quotes?&lt;br/&gt;
How much were you able to reduce your total debt or monthly payments by refinancing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixed vs. Variable Rates:&lt;br/&gt;
Experiences with choosing between fixed and variable rates, especially considering the long-term implications of each choice for international students?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any shared experiences or advice would be immensely valuable. Thank you in advance for your time and help!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my_qualifications: MS in management from top 10 global college. Undergrad in business / finance.&lt;/p&gt;

If you just need the knowledge/credential then do online with a legit university.
