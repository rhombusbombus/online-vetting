The financial trends that soon followed after are detailed in the various models and scenarios spelled out in that study.  Companies soon realized that subscription based services had better offer more value and incentive over the pirated options other than legality if they were to be successful and used this study to do just that.  This also led to a wide variety of monetization and DRM methods that would either succeed or fail based on the markets acceptance.  Bad DRM practices have arguably hurt the industry far worse than subscriptions ever did or will in the future. A nice benefit of cloud based models means less DRM hoops to jump through (provided the cloud doesn't go down which is a legitimate concern)

The ability of the IT world to reverse this trend has been quite remarkable and implementing cloud based subscriptions was not only a good way to put up roadblocks to piracy in the corporate world but was found to be an effective method of getting people to pay for the bug fixes and firmware patches that followed leading to less breaches in security for both the software developers and the end users.  Those that can afford to pay get added security and those that don't and circumvent piracy protections get crippled software and no support.  How many cracked versions of the recent creative cloud or office 365 versions do you see out there?  How about working Autocad cracks?  Most recent torrent listings I can see only go up to Autocad2018 shortly after going sub based that same year.  Torrent searches for recent office 365 only net ebooks teaching it, no downloadable versions exist from what I can see.  Your ""proof"" that it doesn't work because audio companies have been loath to adopt it is laughable here.  It has proven it does work extremely well when implemented to the fullest extent over a cloud based system.  The user base needs to be properly incentivized to do it right though. 

Oh I also decided to ring up an old high school acquaintance that still thinks pirating software is the best thing ever. I asked him about the recent Photoshop 2019/2020/2021 torrent and if they worked and he was able to successfully crack them.  He told me that most of them are quite unstable and he has been sticking with CS6 as he can't reliably use or trust the newer Adobe torrents.  The cracks either work temporarily or crash constantly. so while it is still feasibly possible to acquire and crack photoshop. the benefits these days do not seem to be worth the headaches and most people are sticking much older models, he also made specific mention of seeing significantly less software than there used to be, seems music, movies, and gaming still are the most widely available content these days. Those mediums do not benefit from the same protections with subscriptions that software can benefit from as they are much smaller package and don't need programming expertise to crack.  And forum posts I perused on this topic seem to not say much past 2015 for successful photoshop cracks.  The low seed rate for the most recent versions also lend credence to lower pirating efforts for newer versions versus the CS6 and CC2015 torrents. . Seems they may have actually reduced a fair number of people pirating from what I can tell.  Only the die hards seem to be still working at it.  But the Sub model has made it far less attractive for them to do so it  seems.  More People seem fairly content to download the sub model based on is fairly low cost compared to older method of higher priced software with high priced updates.

&gt; And this shows what? That they're still being pirated even though some introduced the subscription model that you said is a response to the pirating? Ignoring that strange logic, this is about audio software and the only one on that list that is in that category hasn't moved to subscription-only and unless I'm missing something, only offers fixed pricing. Did they not get your memo?

See above AutoCAD, Office 365 seem to to have little to no recent torrents out there (I am admittingly pretty far removed these days from the pirating scene and have been for quite some time, I just may not know where to look these days) And the reliability of Adobe cracks seem to be quite the minefield, I won't entirely discount the ability of hackers as they have always proven to be remarkably adept in the is area.  But it does appear the pool of willing crackers looking for these titles is down quite significantly.

If(when really) audio companies required even more reliance on cloud based solutions from their user bases then yes you would see piracy rates drop 

this article details Adobes success in this arena https://securitygladiators.com/adobe-still-holds-throne-pirate-bay/
and while Adobe still holds a crown per the article it does go on to provide this statement:

*""Fast forward to 2014, Adobe confirmed that the strategy had worked favorably for the multinational computer software company and also affirmed that piracy levels had come down from previous years.

adobe-software-application
Adobe products have been the subject of large-scale piracy since the beginning.
In 2015, Adobe had another reason to celebrate when it noted that the casual piracy community had moved away from pirating Adobe products and instead was starting to shift towards buying authentic Adobe software application products because of the low priced plans.

And it looks like the computer software applications company is all set to continue its auspicious streak as Adobe announced some great news for the shareholders of the Adobe community.

It was revealed that Adobe was able to generate revenues in excess of $1.46 billion and that was just for the third quarter of the year.

Moreover, the $1.46 billion revenue figure was a significant increase from the $1.22 billion year-on-year figure.""*

Seems to be working just fine and is incredibly successful, oh and hey they are also updating more frequently now and so is AVID.  Must be a total failure though listening to you.

The part you are missing here is that piracy played a key role in the formation of subscriptions.  And if you see my edit on my previous post I am actually good friends with Roy the person who Co-owned and operated sonic foundry (the original owner of Vegas prior to Sony.  He directly relates how piracy was the deathknell for SF.  Vegas did indeed stay non subscription based and lost so much fighting piracy with ACID, and Magix/Vegas that they had to sell the company to Sony.  Roy now owns and operates Broadjam which tada is a subscription based service, showing that he learned his lessons that hard way.  And at the time Sonic foundry was on the top of their game.  ACID and vegas were both extremely popular at the time.  Where has development led now that sony at the helm?  I know of a small handful of dedicated users but market adoption certainly isn't their strong point.  Seems their model is being solely propped up by the fact that Sony has deep pockets.  Indeed the latest version of Vegas Pro 18 has been lauded to be extremely unstable.  Maybe they should get the memo as it certainly appears that they did not.  Shame too as Vegas was a great piece of software back in the day.  Seems your example falls apart quite quickly when under scrutiny and would have indeed benefitted under a sub model as the owner directly looks back on.",,,,uProfessional,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_nv6m7s,,dark,False,/r/audioengineering/comments/nv6m7s/waves_totally_scamming_me_to_pay_extra_for_my/h15k8bf/,public,False,t1_h15k8bf,,Professional,[],1623247551,,0,,,,,,1388175687.0,,1627740868.0,,broadjam

**Houston-born rapper, Tyme, has released his brand new single, “Holly Anna Lisa,” featuring fellow Houstonian rappers and legends Lil’ Flip and Killa Kyleon.** 

***Stream*** *Tyme - ""Holly Anna Lisa"" (feat. Lil' Flip and Killa Kyleon) on* ***YouTube****:*

* *Explicit Version:* [*youtu.be/T\_MNN72XeMg*](https://youtu.be/T_MNN72XeMg) *\[more streaming/DL links below\]*

The almost four minute long track was officially released on February 26 under Price Royalty Publishing/Universal Music Group. “Holly Anna Lisa” comes as his first new project of this year, right after the releasing by of his last singles titled “On My Momma” and “Air It Out.” Tyme is an artist that certainly did not come to play and in this song, he lays it all out for the world to hear and enjoy.

“Holly Anna Lisa” is a hard hitting, head bobbing rap song with features that only compliment the tone that Tyme has already set. This single has the characteristics of a standard trap song—an amazing beat and great music for the rapper to apply his lyrics to. But what sets it apart are the various classical elements applied to the music which is accompanied by the current rap sounds of Tyme. This song is the perfect meshing and an older era with the era of today.

Each rapper on the song brings a different type of energy to their verses, but they are all cohesive and flow effortlessly on the track. Rapping about numerous aspects of Houston life, not only will Houstonians be able to relate to the lyrics, but others who have lived a similar lifestyle will be able to relate as well. Overall, “Holly Anna Lisa” is great lyrically and is a great listen.

**About Tyme:** Born on the West Coast and raised in the South West of Houston, Texas, Tre Garcia, respected  
and known in the music industry as Tyme, has always had a way with words behind a mic. His insight and lyrical wordplay have always been leagues ahead of his time and he continues to manifest flows and rhyme schemes that place him among some of hip-hop’s greatest. His legacy started as half of the rap duo TymeZone beside his homeboy, but when they parted ways to pursue their solo careers, he adopted the now iconic name Tyme.

Blessed with the talent of a top tier lyricist and the vision to piece sounds together to create hits without the loss of meaning and flaming bars, Tyme is a rare breed of rapper in the modern era of hip-hop. His music holds true to his character, authentic and created from a place of experience and passion. Tyme is like Picasso, painting how he feels, expressing his feelings and emotions. This depth of expertise has brought many memorable milestones in hip-hop, some of which includes performing in Austin TX for Chamillionaire’s last show and doing a show with his big brother and mentor, Rasheed from DopeHouse Records. Rasheed has been a voice of sound advice and guidance in Tyme’s career and has been a major influence and support throughout his rise to where he stands today.

Tyme has since worked with some of the legends that would be regular rotations in his playlist. Tyme and his team are wrapping up promoting their latest release “Holly Anna Lisa” which dropped on February 26 th released under Price Royalty Publishing / Universal Music Group. The track is exactly what you can expect from a perfectionist like Tyme. “Holly Anna Lisa” comes from the chorus or topline vocals of the songs. Simply put, the track is the truth. Tyme takes the southern trap sound and bends it to his will, making it his own. When Publisher and Manager of Price Royalty Publishing, Jeseka Price brought the beat to Tyme months ago, he caught the vibe, and the rest was history. Tyme goes crazy over the beat, dissecting syllables and piecing them together like a surgeon with the mic.

“Holly Anna Lisa” will be the talk of the industry upon its release and sure to make Tyme’s team and kids proud of his latest masterpiece. Follow Tyme and stream his current projects while awaiting the release of his new single “Holly Anna Lisa.”

The name of the city we all (Artists and Jeseka Price as Executive Producer) represent and reside in is Houston, Texas a.k.a. H-Town!

This is just stuff I stumbled upon over the years.

Broadjam like other sites wants you to pay for premier level. They also have endless contests with entry fees. 
The main thing is, you can review other people’s tracks, and vice versa (if you opt to make your stuff available for review). Ive had some lazy even nasty reviews and some favorable, even highly complimentary ones. So Broadjam becomes almost like Facebook meets Spotify, on a very low level.

For starters I manage a music library, roughly 2000 songs. Most of my annual revenue is from sync licensing deals and youtube adrev. The other portion of my revenue comes from custom video game scores,producing sample packs, and my other company Soundtrack Loops where we sell sample packs and presets. With that said I know Roy the owner of Broadjam. Roy and I go back to the Sonic Foundry days (original ACID, Sound Forge, Vegas, etc). We worked there and he was the VP of marketing. Anyway long story short we both parted with SF and started our own businesses. Roy started Broadjam. My companies have been a partner of the site for many years but I personally have no experience with Broadjam and sync deals. Most of my placements come from a company called APM in Hollywood and they got me in the Universal production music library so I get several hundred synchs every year. I also have music with 5 Alarm, eOne, Spirit,Nightingale Music (Canada) and Getty to name a few. NONE of those companies charge me for an ""opportunity"" and they are actively pitching my music to networks daily. They do take a cut of the publishing back end and a cut of the synch fee but I get 100% writers shares and 100% mechanicals. Personally I don't recommend using any of those types of pay to submit type services. For shits and giggles I threw my non-exclusive library up on Songtradr when they were in beta and the founder hooked me up with unlimited credits. That was years ago and since I've made roughly $150 from that site. I personally don't recommend Songtradr or any of those types of micro sync pay to play type services. You just don't get that personal touch and who knows if they're actually even listening to your submissions.

Try to get your library with a reputable publisher / library agent like APM, Universal, 5 Alarm, Killer Tracks, Megatrax, Red Bull, Spirit, BMG, etc as they are the real deal IMO. This is my 2 cents so to speak I've been in this music library biz since 2009. Save your money for building your library and building your brand. Use some of that money to go to some tradeshows for networking like NAB in Vegas for example. The PMC in LA is great too (production music conference) I landed a publishing deal there that paid for my entry fee and then some within the first year by getting some of my tracks in the TV show Catfish on MTV which is STILL paying me a nice chunk of cheddar.",[],,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_eo61ch,,,,/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/eo61ch/recently_i_was_thinking_about_submitting_my_music/feanhkv/,public,False,,,,[],1578950579,r/WeAreTheMusicMakers,0,,,,,,1354907120.0,1587878018.0,,False,broadjam

The online culture is really toxic whether its stuff like this here, the song contests on Broadjam or Taxi, the Producer groups on FB etc. 

Very few professionals are out there sharing music online for feedback, and even less are doing so with unfinished material. That is counterproductive at best and totally self defeating.

As a composer and producer, I put out music for sync (tv/film licensing) primarily, under about 5 different names. The only thing that ties my real name to the material is the fact that I am the point of contact for the publishing company that administers the works of all my alteregos, and that my name is on the split sheets of any collabs I do (very few)

If you want to hear my work and the work of others like me, get off soundcloud and youtube and start looking at publishing libraries, sync catalogs and independent publishing syndicators. Read tv and film credits and look up the publishing companies and music department listings.

I spend time browsing most of the subs that focus on genres or styles I like, partly to keep an ear to the ground as to what styles are growing/fading etc and what folks are talking about. 

I don't work too much in hip-hop or beatmaking focused genres, although I have both ghosted some tracks for fairly well known artists and produced/engineered sessions with a few artists you know, im sure. The culture really glorifies the self made producers like Dre or Ye or what have you but a lot of the producers that I encounter that focus on slinging beats and looking to make a name are too concerned about their persona and self promotion and attaching themselves to the right crew or label. And their music suffers as a result, because they are busy trying to impress and chasing styles instead of developing a voice of their own and just networking. 

It's different in other genres, but not better or worse really.  Electronic music is just as bad in different ways - style purists and the hardware vs software fanatics suck.  Rock and pop are filled with their own flavors of big heads and loudmouth bedroom engineers. Cinematic types of styles are full of classically trained purists vs kitchen sink type modern aesthetics. 

Basically, its all a giant shitshow full of people trying to impress and others trying to tear down because of their own fears and personality issues.  It doesn't mean a thing except to give you a benchmark of what you need to rise above.

Make the best beats you can, make as much new and different stuff as possible. Grow big ears and take from every genre possible. Steal like an artist and learn to take it all in and turn it into something unique and creatively you.  And don't give up.

Learn how copyright and publishing really works, study the music business in general (not just your style) and learn to network in the real world.  Online and social media is one tiny piece of the puzzle with less overall impact on the day to day than you would think. If you sell a beat, get a track optioned by a dj label, or score a juicy sync placement congrats! Now the marketing and social is their problem and they have pros and interns and budgets. Get back in the studio and worry about your music instead.

  More people know me online as a guy who makes production videos and courses than as a composer or engineer and that's just the way I like it.  If you check my post history you'll see its 95% helping others troubleshoot problems or explaining stuff to newer or inexperienced users.  That's the way it should be, in my mind. Accept help and mentoring on the way up, and make your own knowledge available to the next generation as they develop.

&gt; Michael Bell is currently the independent record label owner of Belltime Productions /Bell Time Records, and website owner of BuyMusicFromUs.com. He began playing trombone at the age of 13yrs. Old, and later began playing guitar, bass and drums for various local groups in the Detroit area. In 1984, he became a church organist and minister of music, and later went on to record several albums as a Record Producer. He produced his first big recording in 1999, on the contemporary Christian artist Jeannine Byerly. He has since written and produced several more albums, of which, some have had much charted radio success.

&gt; Michael has played guitar with such recording artists as: David Ruffin, Tyrone Davis, Laura Lee, The Floaters Orchestra, Michael Bell &amp; The Wings Of Freedom, Orlando Draper, and many others. He has since become a proficient songwriter, music composer, record / ringtone producer and sound engineer.

&gt; Michael won $6000 worth of recording equipment in a 2004 songwriting competition at: songwriter.tv, and also was a finalist (four songs in three categories) in the UK 2004 International Songwriting Contest. He's had fifteen #1 songs on the broadjam Top 10 Charts, and. as Michael would say, ""writing a song is like taking a drink of water, I don t have to think about how to do it, it just comes so naturally"".

&gt; One unique thing that stands out about Michael is his ability to play the role needed in creating, and displaying his demo song material. He is the writer, composer, arranger, producer, performer and studio engineer on over 95% of his demo songs. Although Michael claim is truly as a songwriter, he is grateful that many of his other talents are being displayed through his music.

&gt; Writing and Producing original music is what Michael Bell, CEO of Belltime Productions is all about!  Read more on Last.fm.

On Bigger Licensing Deals One of the most sought-after deals is to be represented by a big licensing company like Bank Robber Music or Ocean Park Music Group. Most of these deals are made by having the right team on your side and being associated one of the label, management or legal teams these licensing companies work with. Instead of soliciting to a big licensing company with your music, work hard on attracting a great team to your music. It will be much easier to get in their door. 

There are many smaller licensing ﬁrms who will make small, non-exclusive deals with you and submit you for placements with music supervisors. Many of these contracts are easy to negotiate and very standard. These smaller licensing companies can often be the start to a relationship that will take you to a larger music licensing deal and more placements. Don’t be close-minded to smaller licensing deals.

&gt; A contestant on the first season's NBC’s the Voice, Casey Desmond is a thoroughbred artist and modern-day renaissance woman.  A previous Sonicbids and Diesel Music US &amp; Japan branding &amp; marketing model, Casey’s captivating unique style and music combine her impressive vocal melodies, synth-driven electro dance rhythms &amp; socially conscious lyrics with a retro yet ahead-of-the-curve fashion sense that keeps today’s tastemakers wanting more &amp; comparing her to electro-pop icons like David Bowie, Cyndi Lauper, Blondie, and today’s dance pop divas like Lady Gaga and Katy Perry. 
 
 Practically raised in her musician parent’s recording studio, its no wonder she now lives amongst a rare collection of vintage synths, keyboards, guitars and state of the art recording gear and her living room is mostly used as a rehearsal space for her band. No one can deny that Casey’s world is making music — but her artistry doesn’t stop there.

Monica is an angel is this regard.  So down to earth and respectful.  Much love to the Phox crew

Edit: So that's not actually the whole song just a portion apparently.  I need to learn to pay attention it would seem.

This is just great. :) You have a ton of talent!!!

I really enjoy your songs. You playing is very clean and your voice has a very happy tone to it. I can't help but think that your voice also has the kind of projection and clarity that would do well in a musical in the Broadway stage - have you ever done any musical theater? 

I also really like the subtle touch of reverb on the recording, it gives a bit of space and resonates nicely without sounding like you are in a tunnel or swimming in an echo chamber (like many self-produced recordings of others that I have heard), so I have to ask what reverb or other effects did you use?

I am planning to record and release my own songs sometime this year, how do you feel about bandcamp? I am also looking at CDBaby, iTunes, TuneCore, Amazon, Broadjam, DiscMakers but not sure which one to use - any thoughts would be appreciated.

The creative process usually went like this: I have an instrumental, they would write lyrics to the instrumental. We'd tweak the instrumental to fully support the lyrics and vocals, then record. I'd submit the fully produced track to a service like TAXI or Broadjam. If they were interested, they'd want an instrumental version of the song, a ""clean"" version of the song (no swears), and the original version of the song. They'd place a lot of instrumentals as underscore, but occasionally a full song would be used as well.",,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,t3_27i0eg,,,False,,,,t1_ci3hdjy,,,,1402362833,,0,,,,,,,1434168686.0,,,broadjam

I was only a member of Taxi for a year... and i started off strong.  Pop placements mostly.  One of them led to an ongoing relationship with an agent in L.A.  Being from a small town in Canada, that was exciting at the time haha.  I still work with him now after several years...

I'm much more a songwriter, and I only learned production as a way to get those songs across.  I'm still learning, but I've gotten much better... 
What I was submitting definitely didn't have that professional ""sheen"" that it should have had.  The strength of the songs was always there though, and that pushed me through I suppose.  A strong song can push through a sub-par mix, but it shouldn't have to.  Even the most experienced listener/reviewer is going to be subconsciously affected by the level of production.  

Money was not decent!  I don't money will ever be decent again in music, actually.  That's said from limited experience, but it's my gut feeling.  With Broadjam, I won a competition to have a song placed in Dance Dance Revolution on XBOX360.  That was pretty cool and there was a nice one-time payment for it.  All my other placements were with Taxi though.

That they have a stable of writers already and these writers submit as normal users. So when they produce their stuff, Amazon will make it a big thing like they picked some Joe Unconnected off of the Internet and get lots of media coverage for their projects.

Edit: I just realized this may sound sarcastic, but it's a legitimate question. I'm jaded from my experiences. Amazon Studios *could* be something like the Steam Workshop, but most companies aren't as forward thinking as Valve.

I'm also dubious of The Black List being a route anywhere because I don't know if any producers are actually using it to find things to make. From what I've heard, it's writers reading other writers' works and sounds like the old garage band website Broadjam.

I have a solid background in mixing and mastering and I've also found sync points to be a really crucial part of the process.  Extending or truncating cadences have been a part of my 'bread and butter' as a composer.  His novelty aside, Phillip Glass.  'nuff said 'bout that.  Matching that stuff up to sync points is a harder story.

Now, what is a streamer and punch?  Personal recommendations on some good indie-style scores?  I write cinematic tunes, but rarely for anything cinematic.  I'm looking at doing lot's of short indie films and documentaries with a couple of other folks, but, I think you're right in that video games are what I should shoot for.  I used 'broadjam' for a while a number of years ago, but it's really a bit of a sham, especially nowadays with places like reddit, craigslist and musician-classifieds.  For film scoring, I'm trying to find the proverbial valve of demand to supply some tracks to.  Reddit seems to be a solid place to do some networking (my first day here) and community outreach stuff?
