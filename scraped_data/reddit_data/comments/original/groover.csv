Cheap plastic cutting board 
Ruler (plastic see thru with grid is best)
Box cutter
Compass
Leather glue
Stitching chisels (5 teeth and 1 tooth)
Hammer
Harness needles
Thread
Sand paper (60/220/400/800/1500)
Something to burnish with (heavy canvas, smooth wood, etc)
Lighter



Nice stuff to have:


Rubber mallet
Cobbler's Hammer 
Round strap end punches, various sizes
Metal ruler
Stitching awl
Tokonole or similar burnishing agent
Variety of pricking irons and stitching chisels
Carpet cutting blade
Stitch groover
Safety skiver



I'd suggest starting with the first list and make a wallet, figure out what you want to upgrade first. My suggestion is skiver, cobbler's hammer and end punches. Those make the biggest difference in product quality IMO. Fwiw I haven't found a self-healing mat that stands up to cutting leather, but I tend to work with 12+ oz leather which requires a lot of pressure to cut.

A few critiques and a tip. 

Tip first: dye, finish and buff the components *before* assembly. You'll have an easier time getting an even color, and the thread won't take on any dye or the beating it received on this piece. 

I prefer to use Fiebing's leather balm with atom wax for my finishes. It's a harder, longer-lasting protective layer compared to beeswax, doesn't affect the color, and presents a finer, glossier shine similar to well polished shoes. 

Your edges look pretty good. I might have done a final layer of tokonole or edge paint for gloss, but these look good and match the rest of the piece. 

On your stitching, a couple of points. Use a straight edge or ruler to lay out where your stitching holes will go. I like to use a stitching groover, but some folks like different tools. When you're stitching, pay attention to your *pattern.* That is, move the threads through the same process on every stitch, identical to the last. The more consistent your pattern, the more even and regular the stitching will look. 

Wax finishes need to be reapplied more often than acrylic, but in my opinion are the superior material. Wax is better at keeping water out, and as the finish wears off, wax sticks around better. It doesn't crack or flake off like acrylic, and penetrates deeper into the grain of the leather. However, it is more susceptible to heat. I'll use atom wax on wallets, but not on anything that's going to be in constant, direct contact with skin and sweat.",[],,0.0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, an excellent piece.

&gt;New lawsuit alleges price-fixing at Seattle-area apartment buildings  
Sep. 8, 2023 at 5:50 pm    
A new lawsuit alleges the use of pricing software by large property management firms across the country, including in the Seattle area, amounts to illegal price-fixing.  
By Heidi Groover Seattle Times business reporter  
&gt;  
&gt;  
Once again, large property management firms across the country are facing allegations that their use of rental pricing software amounts to illegal price-fixing that drives up costs for tenants.   
  
Attorneys filed an antitrust lawsuit Friday on behalf of a Seattle renter alleging that 18 property managers across the country use a software known as RENTmaximizer from the California company Yardi Systems to trade otherwise private information and inflate rents. The claims are similar to those filed against another software company, RealPage, late last year.  
  
The RENTmaximizer case, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, seeks class-action status.   
  
Kirkland-based Calibrate Property Management, Bellevue-based HNN Associates and Seattle-based Pillar Properties are among the property management companies named in the case, along with Yardi. The companies use the RENTmaximizer software and manage more than 4,000 units, according to the suit.   
  
Yardi and the three Washington companies did not respond to requests for comment Friday.  
  
Similar to the claims regarding RealPage, the suit claims competing property managers submit “detailed, competitively sensitive, and non-public information about current supply, production, and pricing plans regarding leasing” to the RENTmaximizer software — knowing that their competitors do the same — then use the software to set rents.  
  
“Our antitrust legal team has uncovered what we believe to be a clear gaming of the system through controlled, lockstep algorithmic increases to fix the cost of rent — one that has affected millions of renters,” Steve Berman, one of the Seattle attorneys bringing the case, said in a statement. “Housing is a basic human need. What these companies have done is both legally and morally bankrupt.”  
  
Yardi launched RENTmaximizer in 2011 and by 2013 said the software was in use at 8 million units, “a number that is likely far higher today,” the lawsuit says.  
  
Without the software, the lawsuit alleges the companies would set rents based on demand in the market.  
  
“In the absence of knowledge about competitors’ pricing strategies, property managers can only make their best educated guesses and set their prices at optimal positions — usually a bit lower than what \[is\] offered by competitors — to attract renters in the market,” the suit says.  
  
In public-facing materials, Yardi has promised to increase property revenues by 3% to 6% and allow property managers to “beat the market,” according to the suit. Lawyers say their own analysis found that rents in areas with high usage of RENTmaximizer averaged 6% higher than rents for comparable apartments in other areas.  
  
The lawsuit points to a 2015 news release in which Philip Nored, then the owner and managing partner at Bellevue-based HNN, said, “RENTmaximizer has taken the guesswork out of our rental pricing and lease terms, and boosts pricing performance through an intelligent system of measurements, fixed factors and discipline.” An online post from Yardi highlights Seattle-based Pillar Properties’ use of various Yardi products, including RENTmaximizer, to “drive higher revenue, manage costs and balance risk.”

Those cases have since been consolidated in a federal court in Tennessee.",[],,0.0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently there is software many companies use that &amp;quot;optimizes&amp;quot; rent income and is alleged to be price fixing.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm one of the co-owner. I thought is was a good idea to give you a little lowdown on how our site works and of course it's also helpful for any other musicians who read this.  
**Musosoup works very differently from other platforms**  
**Quality Control**   
\- Unlike other platforms, we vet all musicians for quality control to Musosoup. Unless we feel they will connect with the 300+ curators using the Musosoup monthly, we simply don't let them in.  
**Costs**   
\- A campaign is £36 for 21 days, you can submit way in advance of your release to gain extra free campaign days. Eg: Submit a month in advance if your release and get a 51 day campaign for the same price.  
\- If you have no budget you'll still be able to apply for some free coverage in the marketplace and also accept free playlist adds and social shares from offers.  
\- If you have a budget you can extend your coverage in a pay-as-you-go method. This is explained below.   
\- **Each campaign garners normally around 30-70 playlist adds at no extra cost** than the campaign setup fee.   
**Offer System - Curators can approach you via what we call an offer.**  
\- Offers can have a contribution for creative time, marketing or hosting fees. We base the £ on a rough UK wage. For example, a blogger may ask for £5 contribution for 30mins worth of writing time. The average offer is £8, some are still free, or more depending on the time involved or reach. This gives a sustainable avenue for curators and an affordable PR model for artists  
\- If any cash is requested via an offer there is always a free option, 99% of the time these are playlists.  
**Musosoup's Marketplace**  
\- We also have a Marketplace which is a bit like the traditional model of artists applying like you may know on sites such as Submithub and Groover. Again ours is different, **you don't waste money via feedback** (feedback can be helpful sometimes).  
\- We have no feedback   
\- You can apply to curators but you don't waste any money if your music is not approved by the curator.

If you want to open Spotify and see a higher number next to your songs, then sure.

Fact is, you're paying regardless.

Getting on editorial playlists *is* possible but hard.

Getting playlists through Groover or Submit hub costs you, you just pay the service rather than the actual curator.

When you pay to get on a direct list one of two things usually happens. They either put you on a bot list or they drop you in a playlist that's already popular that may or may not have anything to do with your music.

I have a friend who used a pay service…I forget the name.

Anyway, they put him on a playlist that got him 15000 streams. But the actual playlist was all Elvis and Buddy Holly music … he's a Tame Impala type of musician BTW.

So basically he's on a popular playlist and for the people who were too lazy to change the song he got a play... 

BUT he *did* also get 10% of those people to follow him and add his song to their playlists. 

Is that worth it? 

Depends on you...

There's one way.

Before my Lives got banned on my main account (that&amp;#39;s a whole nother story right there; TOOOOOO fuckin many haters!!!!), I was doing CRAZY numbers on TikTok Live, which I used to get all types of streams on my debut Hip-Hop EP. Even though Spotify pays SHIT to artists, I got more streams than ever before just by promoting my shit on TikTok Live. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you gotta do is find your niche on TikTok Live and your Lives will sell themselves. The only problem is that you gotta deal with TikTok&amp;#39;s bs community guidelines, cuz they WILL shut you down in the middle of a live if they don&amp;#39;t like what you&amp;#39;re talkin about. I know firsthand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, hell, if you can help me get my backup account up to the 1000 follower mark, I&amp;#39;d be more than happy to do some revenue sharing when I&amp;#39;m back to doing Lives. I know how to get numbers oj TikTok Live and I barely even scratched the surface on what I&amp;#39;m capable of. I peaked at 2900+ followers, 10 subscribers and 300+ consistent Live viewers with 12k total views total.  Here&amp;#39;s a screenshot of my beat Live before my Lives were banned on my main account:&lt;/p&gt;

Two literally lifesaving medicines are readily available if you know where to look for them.  Aspirin is derived from willow bark, and a strong tea, extract, or tincture will contain enough acetylsalicylic acid to have the same effect.   Penicillin mold grows naturally on bread, melon, and citrus fruits- It starts off white and then turns a sort of blue-green color.  Separating it from the other molds and contaminants likely to be present is more of a challenge, but if we're talking preindustrial eras, using the raw form is probably safer than not using it.

Leatherworking can be done with a literal handful of tools- an awl, small mallet, round knife, needles, stitching pony, and some oil.  At a slightly more advanced tech level, add in hole punches, edger, groover, strap cutter, and riveting.  Learning to tan hides isn't particularly difficult, and will give you your raw materials.  This is a skill you can use pretty much anywhere the last 5000 years to get by.  Tooling or embossing can also be done with a handful of pocket sized tools, and can be developed to ""master craftsman"" levels that demand good prices.

Flutes and log or frame drums have basically always existed, and a lyre or very simple stringed instrument won't look too far out of place anywhere (especially if you claim it came from a foreign region).  Singing and telling stories has been a popular profession from prehistory right up until the invention of television.  In a world without books or movies, this is a skill that might not make you rich, but you will almost always be able to count on someone offering you a meal and a bed for the night.

Then there's a few simple engineering things: Water wheels and windmills are the biggest ones.  Those give you the raw power of a turning axle.  A few wooden gears and leather belts, and you can produce grain mills, lathes and circular saws, water pumps, automatic bellows and hammers for forges and foundries, and a host of more advanced devices.  

An automatic bellows opens the door for blast furnaces, which means smelting harder metals like iron.  If you have the ability to melt metal, sand casting is another underrated technology that will let you turn wax or wooden models into all manner of metal tools and parts using nothing but a wooden frame, fine sand, and some oil. 

A few other game changing technologies if you can learn them are making cement, compasses, distillation of alcohol and petroleum, steam engines, printing presses, the compressors used in refrigeration and air conditioning, barbed wire, and of course, gunpowder.  Another thing which would absolutely change everything if it came along a millennia or two early is the bicycle, as pedals are one of the most efficient ways to convert human effort into kinetic energy.",[],,0.0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, here&amp;#39;s my advice:&lt;/p&gt;

He's a big tools guy and pretty much spearheaded the Corbin Carroll hype train as a prospect (he had Carroll at No. 1 a year ago). 

Lawlar Top 5 is no surprise, Law loved Lawlar to the D-backs in the 2021 draft. FanGraphs has him as their No. 5 prospect in their 2023 update, although they've yet to publish their Top 100 for 2024. If he doesn't take over at SS by the end of the year, I'm going to have concerns. Perdomo is a stopgap option as a starter, but better suited to play an utility role long term. Almost zero chance he returns a PPI pick for the D-backs, the 2024 rookie class is more stacked than 2023 and he doesn't have an MVP ceiling. Still should be a very good SS, occasional All-Star at the position.

Troy's long term position is going to be interesting. I think he's a guy with the athleticism and instincts to play all the infield and outfield positions if needed. A lot of moving parts in regards to their infield prospects, they have a lot of high quality darts. Lawlar, Troy, Luis, Torin, Groover, Melendez, Santana, maybe even Yassel Soler (2023 IFA) could potentially join the mix. Built like a short king, has a lot of skills on the field, the type of player who will reach his ceiling (20/20 threat while hitting .280) if healthy.

Luis is helium prospect, even if he won't stick at shortstop (not because he can't play the position but you're not bumping Lawlar or Troy off the position). Switch hitter, middle infield, it's going to be tough to avoid the Ketel Marte comps. Probably not the same ceiling, but a chance for an above-average regular at 2B and possibly an All-Star. I'm watching his numbers like a hawk in 2024. A productive year could mean a jump to the Top 50 since age/level is probably what hurts his stock right now.

My guess is his ranking of Lin in his Top 100 is the fact he's a very safe SP projection, but starter upside I think is limited due to size and velocity concerns. Has 7 different pitch types (4-seam, 2-seam, cutter, curveball, slider, filthy change) with 2 above-average breaking pitches and one of the best offspeed pitches in the system (Martinez's splitter only pitch that's better IMO). His only issue is he's 5'11"" and 160 lbs. (weight bothers me more than height) while averaging around 90 MPH, so I have concerns about his ability to last more 80 pitches a start at the MLB level. Can he add more muscle to be able to withstand the rigors of 30+ starts a season? If not, he'll be a great swing man/No. 6 starter at worst that can give you 80-100 IP.

Jones has to show he can be healthy for at least a full year before we can expect him to do anything in a D-backs uniform. There are a lot of issues with his hitting mechanics right now, some bad habits he needs to fix. I have concerns about his ability to add muscle, as he's already a very wiry build, which makes him a bigger injury risk than he already is. His bat will determine the speed he reaches MLB because he's already the best defensive outfielder in the organization by a country mile (Daulton Varsho level good).",[],,0.0,,False,False,"[{'a': ':JohnsonRandy:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/ha8n4h9bhnna1_t5_2sc56/JohnsonRandy'}, {'e': 'text', 't': ' Randy Johnson'}]",False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keith Law tends to rank Arizona&amp;#39;s system a bit more optimistically than other systems.

I've released music with and without small and medium-sized labels. Other than prestige and bragging rights, I just don't see the point of signing anymore. 

Things in the music world have turned almost completely upside down from the pre-internet era. Today artists can record, engineer, produce, master, decorate, distribute, and promote their own work (and reach millions of listeners) without ever getting out of bed. The best you could hope for in 1990 was a used 4-track to make a shitty demo to shop around while playing to empty coffee shops and dive bars in hopes of getting noticed. Aside from a few scattered punk-ish collectives, there wasn't anything even *remotely* like social media at the time. 

And back in the day big artists got hosed left and right. I just saw some mess about how the wildly successful 90s R&amp;B group TLC sold millions of albums and toured for sold-out stadiums and took home something like $35k a year each. (Yes, that's like $70k in 2024 money, but still. What the actual *duck*.) 

So fuck it, do it yourself. No, it's not cheap. Yes, it's a huge amount of work. No, you're probably not going to see a lot of money unless you tour and move some serious merch. But my god you can reach *masses* of listeners in a matter of months without ever dealing with a label. I got playlisted via services like SubmitHub and Groover and purchased one (one!) cheap advertising package on TikTok and saw my numbers go from low double digits to well over 1,000 in a matter of weeks. That's almost two orders of magnitude. That's *insane*. And all this was *after* the same music was released by a reasonably strong label in my genre. The release itself did very little to boost the signal. All the heavy lifting fell to me. I've got more new music ready to go. You'd better *believe* I'm skipping the labels this time around. 

(Quick tip: Never spend money on music promotion services that approach you. Always approach *them*, and only deal with reputable names. Way too many con artists out there.) 

OH. And I heard some vague tea about one of the labels that I'm working with from a playlist curator via SubmitHub. Something about ""we usually don't showcase songs from label X, but we like your song, so congrats."" I was all like, why, what's wrong with my label? They alluded to some shady behavior but refused to say more. My imagination's running wild, so fuck *that*. 

So yeah. Stay independent. Don't sign. We live in a weirdly golden age of independent artists. It's still a crap shoot (your music has to resonate, you have to find your niche, you have to be a savvy promoter, etc), but the stars can align *so* much easier now than ever before. 

One last word of caution: social media sugar highs come at a cost. You still have to pump out quality music on a regular basis, and it might take months or years to resonate. You might have a viral moment, but those come and go quickly. Play the long game. Keep your head down and get back in the studio.

&lt;p&gt;Things in the music world have turned almost completely upside down from the pre-internet era. Today artists can record, engineer, produce, master, decorate, distribute, and promote their own work (and reach millions of listeners) without ever getting out of bed.

This is a list of tools I use regularly as well as the resources that helped me learn the craft. I am by all means not an expert, a professional or an authority. These are not boutique tools. They are affordable and, in some cases, need a little TLC to get them to perform perfectly (your mileage may vary). But they are certainly good enough to get results at least as good as mine (if you like mine, lol).   
Notes:  
1.	I did not put leather stamps on here but know this, you don’t need that many. Starting out you can get by with a couple basket weave stamps, seeders, camouflage stamps, veiners, bevelers, shaders (maybe 3-5 or each).  And buy good stamps, I know it’s enticing to buy those 25-piece sets of Chinese stamps… Don’t. Most are dull and leave terrible details. Spend the extra money and get good quality stamps like these . The difference is NIGHT and DAY. Crappy stamps will make you quit the hobby. Also get a piece of granite to stamp on. It helps prevent stamp bounce and double strikes, requires less force, and the detail is much better.  
2.	A note on casing (wetting leather prior to tooling “stamping” it). Everyone has their own voodoo art to it. I simply spray water on the leather till it soaks to about the middle, then let the tooling surface air dry back to the color it was when you started (before spraying). There’ll be plenty of water in it. Also, apply painter’s tape to the opposite side you will be tooling, this keeps the leather from stretching. Leather stretches a LOT if you don’t do this as well as deforms and cups.  
3.	Can’t think of anything to practice, cut apart old leather things you have and use them as a pattern.  
4.	Buy bags of scrap leather to practice on.  
5.	Read up on types of leather, their uses and weights, this will help you pick the right leather and weight for your project.  
6.	Use your dividers to layout straight stitches, you can see crooked stitches from orbit.  
7.	Use the right weight thread and the right stitch spacing for the job. Leave the fine stitches to the machine. 4mm stitch spacing with 0.8mm thread and 5mm stitch spacing with 1.0mm thread (that’s what I like).   
8.	Know when to use a beveler and when it’s not necessary.  
9.	Always slick the edges that need it.   
10.	Radiused corners are “generally” nicer to look at.  
11.	There are other colors than black.  
12.	Someday get an airbrush, gradients are easier, dye goes further, and finish is generally more even.  
13.	Get a lacing pony at some point (I designed and 3D printed one for myself)  
14.	Practice your lacing (watch videos on it).

I hope this helps you and I hope you end up enjoying leather work as much as I have.",[],,0.0,,False,False,[],True,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok. Here you go. This is a list of tools I use regularly as well as the resources that helped me learn the craft. I am by all means not an expert, a professional or an authority. These are not boutique tools. They are affordable and, in some cases, need a little TLC to get them to perform perfectly (your mileage may vary). But they are certainly good enough to get results at least as good as mine (if you like mine, lol).&lt;br/&gt;
Notes:&lt;br/&gt;
1.  I did not put leather stamps on here but know this, you don’t need that many. Starting out you can get by with a couple basket weave stamps, seeders, camouflage stamps, veiners, bevelers, shaders (maybe 3-5 or each).  And buy good stamps, I know it’s enticing to buy those 25-piece sets of Chinese stamps… Don’t. Most are dull and leave terrible details. Spend the extra money and get good quality stamps like these . The difference is NIGHT and DAY. Crappy stamps will make you quit the hobby. Also get a piece of granite to stamp on. It helps prevent stamp bounce and double strikes, requires less force, and the detail is much better.&lt;br/&gt;
2.  A note on casing (wetting leather prior to tooling “stamping” it). Everyone has their own voodoo art to it. I simply spray water on the leather till it soaks to about the middle, then let the tooling surface air dry back to the color it was when you started (before spraying). There’ll be plenty of water in it. Also, apply painter’s tape to the opposite side you will be tooling, this keeps the leather from stretching. Leather stretches a LOT if you don’t do this as well as deforms and cups.&lt;br/&gt;
3.  Can’t think of anything to practice, cut apart old leather things you have and use them as a pattern.&lt;br/&gt;
4.  Buy bags of scrap leather to practice on.&lt;br/&gt;
5.  Read up on types of leather, their uses and weights, this will help you pick the right leather and weight for your project.&lt;br/&gt;

I sang and wrote poetry/melodic lines since I was a kid. Took classical lessons (which did not really speak to my interests at all) until I graduated high school. Logical thing from there (since my education was being paid for by my grandmother and parents) was to take my mom's advice and study classical voice at a very prestigious uni. Which I hated. It was the worst time in my life. I almost didn't survive the experience (literally). It was extremely competitive, judgmental, rule-focused, perfectionistic, and I found the genre to be white supremist in nature. While I was there I also studied piano, guitar, and numerous other instruments, by then end of the degree thinking I sucked at all of them more than I did before I entered.

  
After about seven years of recovery from that toxic, awful experience, I had taken some production courses and had created a collection of ideas for songs (relatively diverse in genre but under the umbrella of art pop). 

I started to play open mics (just me, a pedal, and a guitar) and booked 4 or 5 gigs with some friends I'd met at an open mic who are in a 2 piece band.

In the past year, I met with several producers to find out who could help me bring my songs to a more professional level and create an album. I found one who worked on a single with me for about 2 months and it turned out fantastic. Then he moved 2 hours away. After having spent $750 on another producer in the area who barely touched my music and considered the project finished, I decided to go back to the first guy, having to make 2 hour one-way commutes for every recording session.  
We're almost finished the album now and it feels great.

&amp;#x200B;

2. What are the main challenges you've faced in gaining recognition in the music industry?

I haven't found much success so far. 

I've used Groover to get some recognition and I can't say much about the success yet because they all got back to me and added me to their playlists but the impact on my stats has been minimal in the weeks since that occurred. It's too early to tell. 

I've tried selling merch to gain recognition but with tshirt prices and the economy being so out of whack, I've only had close friends and family make purchases so far (within 2 months of starting to sell).

I find people are not as excited about and committed to musical artists as they used to be, in general. It feels like we're more of a dime a dozen commodity now. 

I tried submitting my professionally produced single (which my producer was even excited about long after I'd paid him the money)  to a contest, but no dice. 

People don't seem too overexcited about my insta either. I'm looking to make funny/ artsy videos to attract more viewers.

  
3. How do you currently market your music, and what has or hasn't worked for you?

  
Besides streaming platforms, see above.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Where do you usually find opportunities to showcase your work, and how do you self-promote?

  
I make my own artwork for the music. I designed the tshirts and the single art and I'm designing the album cover.

  
4. What's been your experience with existing platforms for emerging artists, and what features do you find helpful or missing?

  
It's been fine overall, though I think they're raping us financially. They should be paying us more than a fraction of a cent per listen, with payout at minimum $10.

  
5. Which marketing tools or strategies have been most effective for expanding your audience?

  
Releasing a professional single and telling people about it via socials.   


6. How do you connect with your fans, and what challenges do you face in maintaining that connection?

  
I sell merch and have insta. It's hard when you do (almost) everything yourself so I wish I could engage with them more.

  
7. Have you collaborated with other artists, and if so, how do you usually go about it?

  
Yes. I started to play open mics (just me, a pedal, and a guitar) and booked 4 or 5 gigs with some friends I'd met at an open mic who are in a 2 piece band. We never played songs together but they always lent me their equipment.

  
8. What methods or platforms do you prefer for engaging with and growing your fan base?

  
Instagram. It's supposed to be fairly reliable and one time I got 7000 views on just a simple video of me dancing and singing. 

  
9. In your opinion, what's lacking in terms of support or resources for emerging artists in the current music industry?

Point blank, streaming platforms who rake in probably countless millions per year should be paying out artists way more than they do. If they paid a just a dollar a stream, I'd have earned 649 dollars  in the last year from Spotify alone. Even half of that would be nice. 

Government grants take forever to access. I'm thankful to have been able to borrow money from family and save up from my day job to fund my music (my producer alone costs $70/hour and the album will have cost approx. 5-7000 by the end).  

I find that music feels very wild-west ish because you're basically on your own.

&lt;p&gt;And most importantly: why would I care for Percabeth when they met each other like four episodes ago? It just comes off as creepy how they push Percabeth because you just feel the actors don&amp;#39;t feel comfortable enough in their roles yet and suddenly they have to achieve romantic chemistry between their characters. I can feel the waves of uneasiness from the screen every scene they are supposed to come of as jokingly teasing or &amp;quot;behaving like a married couple&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

Primeiro um dos motivos de eu ter gostado do ep, é porque o submundo é sempre minha parte preferida em obras desse estilo e PJO n é diferente. apesar de ficar triste de não terem feio o submundo corporativo, desde o começo não vemos as adaptações modernas empresariais tão forte, então ainda fiquei impressionado pelos cenários do submundo.

Outro motivo, é que a adaptação de algumas mudanças se comparado aos livros, ainda são pra mim, bem interessantes, como a Annabeth sendo presa por seus arrependimentos e ela ser tirada antes, além da Sally invocando e conversando com o ex, são momentos que trazem pra mim que leu os livros, novas adaptações que enriquecem o mundo e as historias. 

MAASSSSS, lá vem as criticas da temporada inteira, que são aparentes nesse episodio, pra mim são dois grandes problemas que trazem as problemáticas da serie, o primeiro é falta de tempo/orçamento, eu sei que ser a primeira temp não ajuda a ter muito renome, já que faz anos que não temos algo de PJO, mas os 8 episódios de 30-40 min, ajudam a diluir muitas situações e detalhes para serem rapidas, o fato das crianças serem super sagazes e descobrirem os perigos, é claramente uma forma do episodio andar rápido, e eles não ficarem presos no problema a um nível de episodio inteiro. Assim a obra trabalha outros aspectos que focam mais nas narrativas, como o Hermes e o Luke, ou a Sally e o Percy.

Essa necessidade de andar e fazer valer cada segundo, traz a falta de muitos complementos dos livros, que seriam sim interessantes, como o acampamento e seu funcionamento interno, como os chalés e casa maior se comporta, momentos que seriam muito apreciados, mas se perdem na correria.

E o segundo maior defeito, que pra mim é realmente o que faz a serie pecar é a direção. Igual foi falado pela Giovana, as pessoas que estão dirigindo a serie estão completamente inertes, todo episodio tem o mesmo tom do inicio ao fim, não a uma grande diferença entre as cenas, você não consegue sentir mudanças de tom no decorrer do episodio porque a direção não trabalha com o que eles tem. Usando de exemplo a medusa, o fato deles descobrirem que ela é a medusa rápido, pra mim não é um problema (assim como foi nos próximos eps, eu vejo como uma escolha narrativa deles serem bem espertos), o problema é que quando é necessário a construção de tensão quando eles discordam dela nas conversas da mesa e da cozinha, não é bem feito. Você não sente a tensão aumentando, você não sente as coisas complicando no tom cinematográfico, você sente pelas falas, mas só as falas não conseguem fazer bem o sentimento, falta a Anna mais desesperada ou o groover batendo o pé.

Não a ideias de construir cenas diferentes, todas as cenas são iguais em tom do começo ao fim, a serie tem muita narrativa e momentos pra mudanças, mas a direção não trabalha de formas eficientes, eu sinto sempre que as mudanças no âmbito narrativo funcionam, a serie segue com a mesma historia e acrescenta pro futuro no tempo que tem, mas no âmbito cinematográfico, elas ficam paradas, inertes no automático, onde os fãs que queriam mais das cenas, ficam putos pela falta e vão descontar na narrativa. (Não que seja perfeita as mudanças, até agora não tenho certeza do fato deles terem perdido o prazo, mas eu acho que narrativamente a muitos mais acertos do que erros.)

Claro, não só são esses os problemas gerais que podem ser criticados, como também tem as lutas fracas, mas os outros problemas podem ser englobados nesses dois grandes, que TEM quer ser melhorados na próximas temporadas.

That's really impressive. A few ideas for things to look into doing next below. Also, just to put it out there, being an original music outfit these days is insanely hard, and there's so much more to it than just playing music. Seems like you've already got your shit together a bit, but if you're serious about this, be prepared for a lot of work on things that seems pretty stupid and unrelated to music at all, like replying to every comment on your first 100 tiktoks or whatever. That's just a part of the game these days.

\-Like everyone is saying, get on TikTok. It's the only platform with an algorithm that actually puts new content in front of users—most other platforms require your content to already have shown engagement potential before they'll field it to new viewers—which is why it seems like all the new viral artists are from TikTok. That said, this is ABSOLUTELY NOT a sure-fire way to go viral—it's more possible on TikTok than other platforms, but it's still incredibly unlikely, and everyone who thinks it's anywhere close to a sure thing is being influenced by the survivorship bias of only seeing the 1/1000000 success stories. So, like, you should do it, but don't get discouraged if you don't go viral quickly.

\-Sub-point: on TikTok, do as many trends as you can. There's no way to ensure a viral video, but if you use a trend that everyone else is already looking at or do an open-verse challenge with a successful artist, it's more likely. 

\-If your music is not on Spotify, get it on there (as well as the other DSPs, but mainly spotify), and if you have any resources at your disposal, use services to promote your music to appropriate independent Spotify curators. Look for platforms that pitch you to independent curators (Groover is the big one of which I'm aware, but there are lots of little genre-specific ones that come and go all the time). You do NOT want the services that allow you to buy streams—Spotify has been getting way more hardcore about docking streams and even kicking artists off of the platform for bot streams. Independent playlist promotion is higher cost per stream and no guaranteed stream count, but it's higher-quality engagement. 

\-A note on stats: spotify sucks, yeah, but if you want to break into the music industry, spotify stream numbers and tiktok followers are the two most important numbers out there. Many industry folks look at these numbers before they even listen to your music. Depressing and frustrating, yeah. But, that's the way it is—if you love and believe in your music, which it seems like you do, these are just a part of the process. 

\-I don't know what the deal with New Zealand booking agencies is, but here in the US, there's sort of a rule that, if you're able to sell out small rooms in 3 separate markets (like, 100 cap), that's when agents will start looking at you. It's very much not hard-and-fast, but that's definitely a turning point. If your band isn't there yet, keep looking for show opportunities in new markets to build and prove those accolades. If you are there, consider emailing a few independent agencies contact-us pages; I wouldn't necessarily ask that they take you on, but if you ask them for advice on how to make yourselves marketable to an agency, well, everyone loves being asked for their expertise. At best, they'll take a look and consider taking you in; at minimum, they'll give you tips for how to be more marketable; and at worst, they won't respond, and you'll have sent one useless email.

\-Try to get to know the pillars of the music scene in whatever your city is. There are probably more opportunities here than you realize. If you get to know the local non-for-profit radio program director, he'll probably do an album release segment for you on the air; if you get to know the promoter for the city's 1000 cap club, next time a national touring act comes through and needs local direct support, you might be the person they call. It takes a while to build those relationships, but they're good to have. 

\-If you've got some resources, consider pooling them and going in for a 3-6 month campaign with a publicist. There are a lot of price ranges for publicity out there; I'd recommend looking for someone in the 500-2000/month range, and only go with a publicist who you meet with and get along well with, and who you can find good recommendations for. It's very much about finding the right person for you and your band; I would recommend against someone who just takes the check and opens their roledex. You want someone who you like personally and who seems to geniunely like your music. There are so many opportunities that you don't even know exist that a publicist can connect you with—online blogs with a few hundred followers, weird special-interest festivals that want to associate themselves with new bands to seem hip, industry showcase concert series, connections with other sides of the music industry like synch licensing, etc. A few notes, though:

1: Publicists are expensive, and some of them suck. Only do this if you have the money and find the right person.

2: Many higher-end publicists might not take you seriously unless you have a manager. If you have one, great. If not, you can look for one. Even more so than with a publicist, finding a manager is about finding the right person; this is the person who is your liaison with the music industry, who's supposed to be fighting for your interests with every one of the other parties you work with. It doesn't necessarily need to be someone from a management agency; it can just be someone who you trust, who believes in your music, and who has a good work ethic. Learning on the job is a must for the music industry anyway, since it changes so quickly.

3: Publicists are somewhat limited by what you're doing during the campaign. If you decide to pay the big bucks for a publicist, try to line up the time period of the campaign with some big shows, and a few single and video releases, and an album, and a label contract signing, and etc etc. The more you do, the more they can do for you.

I've lived in a couple rave centers over the years (florida during breaks, nyc during electro revival/whatever nyc is up to, been in l.a. for a while so seen the scene grow), and VERY generally L.A. is just not much of a \~dance\~ town. I don't know why. Maybe big U.S. cities have a too-cool thing that leads to self-consciousness (I encountered it a bit in NYC tho not as much). But I dunno about that because people in, say, Montreal or Mexico City dance like crazy. Perhaps it's our proximity to fame, and being conscious that everyone is judging everyone here, and not wanting to seem like a certified freek. 

A little less generally, but still generally, hetero spaces tend to be less \~dance-y\~ as do overly white spaces. I love Certified Groovers, but I wouldn't say it's a queer party (this isn't a criticism, like I said, I love CG, but it's kind of an old-head party lol). Us queers had to break out of being self-conscious about our identity so maybe that makes us more likely to let loose.

People said this before, but the music makes a big difference. This kinda deep house is more cerebral thing, bob-your-head more than work it out, though that also depends on the DJ. Also if the speakers are clear and loud and the sub is throbbing, that helps.

Also, L.A. is blessed and cursed with space. I was in Montreal over the summer at a tiny club and it was packed with people and everyone was grooving on top of each other, and if you elbowed someone you just said ""pardon."" Warehouses are big and rarely packed in a good way. People are used to their personal space here, being in our cars all day, working from home, not talking to anyone. If you accidentally brush someone, it's taken as a personal affront.

Lastly, I think it, more than anything, comes down to the lighting. This is true for anywhere in the world. Certified Groovers is sometimes an afternoon daytime party. No one is gonna freek in the broad daylight.

Music promotion already feels like a waste of time/money frequently given how predatory the industry is and how many scams are out there, so when curators do this it makes me very hesitant to use sites like Groover. I&amp;#39;m tired of vague rejections where people say stuff like &amp;quot;This sounds great but it&amp;#39;s too &amp;quot;X&amp;quot; for my tastes&amp;quot; (despite no indication of this on their profile). Groover curators seem to be especially egregious about this. My approvals are way higher (for the same tracks) on Submithub and Dailyplaylists.&lt;/p&gt;

\- **better playlist management:** more comprehensive smartlists with way more options (including filtering based on presence in other playlists, which was a huge gap when i moved from (then) itunes to serato for management. multi-selecting playlists to move or delete

\- **music discovery/purchase:** you can import spotify playlists and have it automatically search against your library to see what is already there. you can add a playlist and automatically search which music stores have it and the cost of each. you can create discovery playlists from music in your library, compare/merge playlists, and more. it makes parts of discovery and prep that took hours take minutes (and a coffee break since store search can understandably take a while)

Also key to this perceived zolo aesthetic is a theatrical flair indebted to Cabaret and the quirky Progressive Rock of Gentle Giant, along with a Zappa-esque sense of humour. The term has also been used to refer to a corresponding visual aesthetic with neon colours and sharp, jagged graphic objects, which prominently features in these artists' album covers and posters; the term itself comes from a 1980s toy company whose products mirror this aesthetic.*

*Early artists Sharkie identified with the term include more Progressive Pop and Glam Rock influenced artists like early Sparks, Split Enz, and Godley &amp; Creme, but the advent of punk and new wave would shift his focus towards the wide ranging sounds of Devo's Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo! (1978) and British bands like XTC and Cardiacs that incorporated the energy of 2 Tone into Art Punk and post-punk, and later groups like They Might Be Giants and Stump with similar oddball appeal. The term has also gained some traction to describe the quirkier side of 1980s Japanese new wave, with Moonriders, the Devo-like P-Model, the Minimal Synth-oriented ピッキーピクニック [Picky Picnic], and sometimes more experimental artists like Wha-Ha-Ha being of interest to American zolo aficionados.*

Lyrics:

Ratification of the E.R.A.
Recruiting poster beckons:
""See Mandalay!""
Sign the papers, shots
Pack ready to go
Now I'm a boy in the U.S.O.

Ballroom dancing
Propaganding
News from stateside
Free Jeep ride

I'm not a yum yum boy
Like those in Zagreeb
I really go for girls
In Army fatigues
Strictly professional
I'm no easy lay
I could talk about
Howitzers all day

Punch and movies
Non-com smoothies
Khaki sweaters
Dear Jane letters

Discussing strategy
With General Jean
Arm wrestling with
A lady marine
Black market nylons
Baby, give me your dough
Now I'm a boy in the U.S.O.
Go!

[Instrumental Break]

Little Chinese boys they
Run to my side
Say ""Mister how about
You give me a ride""
I smile and throw some change
For the world to know
WE'RE NOT CHEAP HERE IN THE U.S.O.

Bob Hope, groovers
Tight maneuvers
Girl G.I. craze

And the thread will wear on the tightly folded corner, making the product less robust.

I do a different order of operations than it looks like you are following.  
First make and glue your internal pockets to internal shell.  Mark the vertical stitch line for the inside edge of your pockets with wing dividers, and punch your holes (you want to stop punching 1 hole before where your bottom edge horizontal stitches will eventually sit (one of those punched on a different orientation will make your stitch line look funky).   I don't connect the internal vertical with the external horizontal lines.   If you try to do so, the changed orientation of the holes from vertical to horizontal could make your final stitch look like it isn't straight.  Use your wing dividers and punches to identify one hole above where the horizontal stitch line will eventually go, or you can eyeball it. 

When you have marked and punched the interior vertical lines, if you have a stitch groover you can groove the back of the stitch line, this allows the stitches to settle in and not stick out into the bill compartment.  I stitch these internal verticals from the bottom and only backstitch at the top end for structural strength  of the pocket entry. Use a hammer/roller/bone folder to flatten your stitch line.  Whatever you have/prefer.
If you are lining, now is the time to attach any backing liner to the interior structure.

Once this is done on both sides, glue the outer shell to one side only.  Mark and punch your stitch holders from the bottom to make the L shaped connection of the bottom and side edges.  (Make sure that your exterior corners are punched in the correct orientation - the stitch hole(s) should slant the corner as opposed to point into it).  
When you have stitched that, mark out your stitch line on the other side (from the inside).
Fold the wallet closed, keep a comfortable tension on the outer shell and when you are comfortable with this motion make a discreet mark where the outer sheep lines up with the inside edge of the unconnected card pocket.  Use that to know where to glue and connect the remaining side of the wallet once glued open the wallet and punch your stitch holes and stitch up the final side of the wallet. Trim off any excess length you had on the exterior shell.

Your images have a stitch line across the top of the exterior shell.  Thats an aesthetic choice but if it has no functional purpose (it's not securing a liner), takes you more time, and will wear faster than the leather, I'd suggest dont do it.

&lt;p&gt;I do a different order of operations than it looks like you are following.&lt;br/&gt;
First make and glue your internal pockets to internal shell.  Mark the vertical stitch line for the inside edge of your pockets with wing dividers, and punch your holes (you want to stop punching 1 hole before where your bottom edge horizontal stitches will eventually sit (one of those punched on a different orientation will make your stitch line look funky).   I don&amp;#39;t connect the internal vertical with the external horizontal lines.   If you try to do so, the changed orientation of the holes from vertical to horizontal could make your final stitch look like it isn&amp;#39;t straight.  Use your wing dividers and punches to identify one hole above where the horizontal stitch line will eventually go, or you can eyeball it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have marked and punched the interior vertical lines, if you have a stitch groover you can groove the back of the stitch line, this allows the stitches to settle in and not stick out into the bill compartment.  I stitch these internal verticals from the bottom and only backstitch at the top end for structural strength  of the pocket entry. Use a hammer/roller/bone folder to flatten your stitch line.  Whatever you have/prefer.
If you are lining, now is the time to attach any backing liner to the interior structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this is done on both sides, glue the outer shell to one side only.  Mark and punch your stitch holders from the bottom to make the L shaped connection of the bottom and side edges.  (Make sure that your exterior corners are punched in the correct orientation - the stitch hole(s) should slant the corner as opposed to point into it).&lt;br/&gt;
When you have stitched that, mark out your stitch line on the other side (from the inside).
Fold the wallet closed, keep a comfortable tension on the outer shell and when you are comfortable with this motion make a discreet mark where the outer sheep lines up with the inside edge of the unconnected card pocket.  Use that to know where to glue and connect the remaining side of the wallet once glued open the wallet and punch your stitch holes and stitch up the final side of the wallet. Trim off any excess length you had on the exterior shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your images have a stitch line across the top of the exterior shell.  Thats an aesthetic choice but if it has no functional purpose (it&amp;#39;s not securing a liner), takes you more time, and will wear faster than the leather, I&amp;#39;d suggest dont do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that helps.&lt;/p&gt;

Little bit of plumbing, sprinker fitting, gas fitting and welding. I am a 3rd generation plumber so I knew what I was getting into. If you have never touched a tool and aren&amp;#39;t too familiar with some of the equipment we use on sites the course isn&amp;#39;t really a bad idea. At the very least they touch on basic safety and you get to mess with a threader, roll groovers, solder/torch.&lt;/p&gt;

2. a cutting tool - round knife is ideal, but a xacto blade works for thinner leathers too
3. ruler
4. a groover / push creaser
5. a marker wheel for stitch locations
6. a diamond awl (much cheaper and more versatile than good pricking irons)

9. saddler's needles - longer, thicker, blunt
10. thread(s) -if possible get a woven one, not spun. Much better to work with. Also polyester is a good material choice, natural threads are good too, but require more wax
11. beeswax, both for edge finishing and for the thread before stitching
12. a wooden edge slicker
13. adhesive, I recommend some kind of barge, but there are good water based leather glues as well

This is all you'd need to put together the first projects; be it belts, bags, wallets, they can be made withi the tools listed above.

Leathers:

1. veg tan cowhide: around 1mm thickness for inner pockets of wallets and similar applications; 2-2.5mm for outer shells of wallets, small goods, bags, belts if you make it with two layers; 3mm also still bags, now nearing single layer belt territory; 4mm singe layer belts, straps, collars, that kind of stuff
2. chrome tan cowhide: any application where softness is important, but where you can mostly hide edges; think handbags  
3. goat: wallets and linings of other projects

there are many different leathers, all with slightly different attributes and aesthetics; depending on the projects you have in mind, you can definitely find something that checks all the boxes. Or you choose a material that looks just great to you and choose appropriate projects.  

If you want to try tooling:

1. swivel knives: a thin one for contours, a thick one for decorative cuts
2. a tooling hammer, usually with a heavy nylon/rubber/leather covered head to protect the tools
3. bevelers for contours, one narrow (around 2mm wide)for details, one wide (4mm maybe) to cover distance more quickly
4. backgrounder, one big for larger areas, one small for narrow areas, both of the same pattern if possible
5. wax paper
6. a blunt metal tipped pen to transfer drawing from the paper to the leather (draw with pencil on paper, trace final version onto wax paper, put wax paper on wet leather and trace drawing with metal pen)
7. a modeling spoon to smooth over edges left after tooling

There are many many many more different tools available, but those are special and not absolutely necessary unless you want to do any kind of western tooling style, like Sheridan or Arizona flowering.  

Good brands to pick tools from are Barry King, Craft Japan, and some by Hide Crafter.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a cutting mat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a cutting tool - round knife is ideal, but a xacto blade works for thinner leathers too&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ruler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a groover / push creaser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a marker wheel for stitch locations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a diamond awl (much cheaper and more versatile than good pricking irons)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a cork block (awl needs to go somewhere when stabbing holes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an edge beveler, size 2 is usually a good starting point, I still rarely ever need 1 or 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;saddler&amp;#39;s needles - longer, thicker, blunt&lt;/li&gt;

En la materia ""introducción a la ingeniería mecánica"" se ve el proceso de diseño mecánico y se usa el libro *The mechanical design process* (Ullman). No cursé esta materia así que no lo puedo recomendar. 

Si te interesan los materiales, *Ciencia e Ingeniería de los Materiales* (Callister) es una muy buena introducción. En particular, el capítulo de propiedades mecánicas es el primer paso para entender cómo y por qué se rompen las cosas. Yo empezaría con este.

*Fundamentos de manufactura moderna* (Groover) es una introducción a procesos de fabricación industrial (mecanizado, fundición, inyección, etc).

Si te interesa saber cuánta carga aguanta una estructura, *Mecanica de Materiales* (Gere) es el libro que se usa en estática. Tené en cuenta que no es una lectura muy ""divertida"" porque es como leer un libro de física. Además este libro es para una materia de segundo año, muchas de las fórmulas salen de tomar diferenciales de material y realizar una integral, no vas a entender muy bien qué está haciendo.  Podés ojearlo un poco para ver las formas básicas de fallo, pero no te lo recomiendo como introducción. (La mecánica de materiales viene después de ciencia de materiales).

*Diseno En Ingenieria Mecanica de Shigley* tiene de todo, es básicamente un libro sobre cómo dimensionar lleno de fórmulas, pero no es introductorio (se da en materias de 3° año).

1. Grind social media. Post every single day to TikTok or YT shorts. Content has to be something people want to watch that just happens to have your music in it.  If it's just you playing your songs it will die. I mean, you might get 1000 views but that's not going to translate into anything meaningful on spotify. Do this everyday.
2. Play live. Grind this till you get to the point where you can get shows where people actually care to see you and the audience isn't already filled with your family and friends.
3. Playlisting. You basically pitch your songs to playlists and hope they get placed. You can do that on submit hub or groover (there's probably more)

What I did was, when you upload your song on distrokid (if you do it long enough in advance) you can pitch to spotify playlists.

You won't always get on, but when you do it's almost a guaranteed couple thousand streams with saves and adds to their playlists. That will in turn result in a about 10% of that audience listening to your other tracks. So if one of my song gets 2000 streams I usually see about 200 or 300 on the other songs off the EP.

I got one song added and then without even trying it was added to a bunch of other playlists that get streams. It had a bunch of streams until I got booted off that list. Now it gets a few hundred streams a week from other smaller lists that added it. I did nothing but pitch it when it was released.

Distrokid also offers a place where you can search for playlists to pitch too.

I release about three songs a month and pitch one out of the 3 of them. I'd say one every other month makes it somewhere.

With that said, you have to have music that is STRAIGHT down the middle.

Russian Alt Folk Metal with hip hop roots isn't going to have many playlist opportunities, though the ONE playlist for that shit is going to LOVE YOU.

I produce a few different styles but they're all pretty easily categorized in their genre.  

I also write for that. I don't make long songs, long intros...but that's what I'm into and I like to listen to.

With that, absolutely NONE of this is going to get you anywhere.

IDK what your goals are but unless you are going to grind... and I mean REALLY grind short form videos on TikTok or YT... you know the ones. Where a dude plays one song on 18 different guitars so you can compare tones, or re-record and produce compelling covers or make your cat dance while you play a song... or teach people something, or some other schtick....you're too far behind the curve. Having good music isn't enough. Audiences want a multi media experience. It's not enough to have one or two good videos, you need a whole channel of content to get follows. Sure, maybe your friends will and random people like you who are just starting, but they're not really fans. 

From time to time guys will pop up on the reddit boards and taut the benefits of TikTok; go check out there stuff and they have like 400 followers and are posting goofy shit I simply do not want to do. 

The conversion from TikTok or YT follower to Apple Music or Spotify subs is abysmal...like 1%. You'd need a ton of video followers to translate to anything meaningful on spotify especially since they're requiring 1000 streams to pay out anything. 

Make no mistake; if you talked to a marketing pro they would say that is the 100% way...and they are correct. 

But unless you are desperate for attention or this is your single only option for making money there is way better use of your time.

Not trying to be a defeatist. 

You can use sites like Submit hub or Groover to get on legit playlists.

You have to pay a 'credit' to submit but they're actual playlists that have actual listeners. You will get rejected, a lot, because the curators aren't always 100% clear what they want... but you can also get some people to listen to your tunes so you're not uploading into a void. 

I have around 1100 monthly listeners (which is nothing to brag about but it's 1100 more people who would have heard my music without doing it.

Of course, it helps to have a label backing you (even small indie ones), as they often have connects at these DSPs and can get your song to the right ear. This is particularly how you see artists with little to no audience and nothing released get their first releases on editorials. 

That being said, I know people who’ve gotten placements on official playlists with self-released tracks just by pitching through Spotify for Artists (no equivalent for Apple yet). I can tell you with complete certainty that your profile on Spotify doesn’t matter all that much - the quality of your pictures, what you write in your bio, pretty much irrelevant. 

Your music counts. Make it good and release it as consistently as you can. When you’re pitching, give a good description of the track, say where you’re based, and feel free to suggest a couple of fitting playlists. 

Spotify used to be more of a level playing field. I remember when you could contact curators directly through google forms. Unfortunately not the case anymore, due both to over-saturation and a lot of major label involvement with DSPs. Not to mention them blindly favouring whatever is going viral on TikTok and Insta right now. 

Don’t sleep on indie playlists and blogs. I would not recommend sites like PlaylistPush or Groover (as someone who’s been a curator). Just not a fan, and seems pretty low value. Submithub works and is my favourite of these types of sites. Again, make sure your description and profile is up to date, and submit to the right places - blogs included. Write ups (and sites like Hype Machine) used to be more important, but they still hold some value. 

Best of luck, don’t stop what you’re doing just because of a lack of attention from Spotify and the like. This industry isn’t easy and thrives on personal connections. But it’s really about the music, don’t forget that. 

Hope that was of some help!

&lt;p&gt;Spotify used to be more of a level playing field. I remember when you could contact curators directly through google forms. Unfortunately not the case anymore, due both to over-saturation and a lot of major label involvement with DSPs. Not to mention them blindly favouring whatever is going viral on TikTok and Insta right now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t sleep on indie playlists and blogs. I would not recommend sites like PlaylistPush or Groover (as someone who’s been a curator). Just not a fan, and seems pretty low value. Submithub works and is my favourite of these types of sites. Again, make sure your description and profile is up to date, and submit to the right places - blogs included. Write ups (and sites like Hype Machine) used to be more important, but they still hold some value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best of luck, don’t stop what you’re doing just because of a lack of attention from Spotify and the like. This industry isn’t easy and thrives on personal connections. But it’s really about the music, don’t forget that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope that was of some help!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Source: I’m an independent artist with about 500K monthly listeners on Spotify currently and over 40 million streams to my name. I’ve been placed in countless editorials over the years and have worked with (and at) many indie labels.&lt;/p&gt;

Fantastic work for your first try! Here are a few tips:  


1. Work on your stitching line. It's not straight and appears wavy.
2. Consider buying a leather compass and a leather stitch groover; they will be a big help.
3. Take your time when stitching, ensuring the flow and tension are even with each step. If they aren't, redo the stitch.
4. Sand down all your edges using 400-1000ish grit. This should give you a nearly mirror-clean edge.

* For Example: sand with 200, then 400 then 600 then 800 then 1000. At 400 dry sand then take your finger and wet it and apply water on the edge. Dry sand 👉wet sand,👉 water/tokonole mix sand.  

* Do this these all the way to 1000. At 1000, use pure tokonole and sand one more time. Then apply a little Tokonole and buff it with a cloth.  

* Practice the edge steps with scrap leather. Glue a few pieces together with adhesive, cut them with a fine blade, and then practice sanding from 200 to 1000 grit.  
  
Practice steps 1-4 on scrap leather repeatedly. Later on, you can incorporate fancy techniques. Hope this helps!",[],,0.0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

Thank you for this message and long analysis of your results on Groover!

* First of all, I went to check your results, and I could see that your music was accepted 175 times out of 729 submissions, that's a **24% acceptance rate** which is quite impressive. The average on Groover is around 20%. I'm not sure I understand when you say that your music is almost never added to playlists... Your music actually gets shared quite a lot, and more than the average! 
* I can also see some of the top playlists in the ""Discovered On"" section of your Spotify profile being playlists you submitted to on Groover (like chillyourmind, XINCLAIR, Music Connoisseur etc.)
* By the way, chillyourmind is extremely selective (only 2% acceptance rate) so hats off on being share by him 🙌🙌🙌
* I also had a look at the replies from the curators whose screenshots you added to your post. These are **particularly selective curators** who still share tracks and have impact. Average acceptance rate on Groover is **over 20%**, many curators are less selective than the ones you display in your post. Being shared by these ones is a true mark of success, not being shared doesn't mean your music is not good, they're super selective about what they share, getting rejected in this situation is actually pretty normal:
   * Larsen Blake is indeed very selective (which is displayed on his profile), he accepts only **3%** of the submissions received. He only accepts tracks on which he has a huge crush on and correspond to his playlist
   * Zollim is a bit less selective, accepting **8%** of the tracks received (out of more than 1,200 submissions received so far, which means **96 tracks shared**)
   * Sad Sounds is one the most selective curators on Groover with a **1%** acceptance rate, they have a huge impact when they share though!
* Appreciation of music genres is as subjective as music tastes themselves, feedback will always be 100% subjective and depending on what the curator likes and wants to share in that moment. The curators &amp; pros need to remain free to share or not your music, that's how they have value, that's how getting shared means something :) Like with chillyourmind for instance!
* For sure, some curators will write more relevant feedback than others, and we monitor this closely. We plan recurring audits, and there's one planned for Q4! That being said, the feedback you displayed in your post respects our guidelines. Curators are free to be selective as long as they explain why they're not sharing. These curators are super impactful AND selective, which explains why small details can decide them not to share. I can understand how frustrating this can be, but you can also celebrate victories when one of them shares your music!
* All of this to say that I believe you got great results, your targeting may improve now that you know the platform better so the return on your investment should become even better with further campaigns. When you get feedback that doesn't bring value, I'd strongly advise you to not consider it too much. Feedback is first and foremost here as a **proof of listening**, we tried removing it in the past but it was a complete disastor, curators were sharing 4 times less, as not having to give feedback kind of withdrew them from really considering whether they wanted to share the track or not
* This is really cool that you were able to grow your audience also through ads, Andrew Southworth is a really good source to improve your strategy on this topic, but you probably already know him and his YouTube channel :)
* Finally, your post title ""The Truth about Groover"" is a bit too much in my opinion, and a clickbait. I must admit it's a bit hurtful, even though I respect your opinion of course. It's more **your** truth about Groover, and the comments/debate that followed is super interesting, shows very different points of view. It's also a bit contradictory with the very essence of your message. Indeed, when a curator says that they don't want to share your track or give feedback, it doesn't mean it's the absolute truth, it's only their opinion (thank God 😅). It's the same in your case here, as you can see through this all conversation and thread.

I wish you the best for your music and project, feel free to reach out to [support@groover.co](mailto:support@groover.co) if you have any questions or would like us to make some recommendations of curators for you to reach out to. You got GREAT results on Groover, I assure you. And I believe they'll get even better over time. But I also understand if you don't want to use the platform again, that's your choice.

All the best,

It all comes to what you're looking for. It seems as if you're not looking for feedback on your music, since you already know it's professionally produce and are not considering taking insights from what people you don't 100% trust think about it. Regarding curators, most of them are not sound professionals, they don't pretend to be, they **curate** songs and have a platform/audience that look/play what they share. A music journalist may know nothing about mixing and still be relevant to share cool tracks to an audience and talk about them.

What you seem to be looking for - correct me if I'm wrong - is the potential exposure these curators can give to you in case they appreciate your track. In this situation, feedback is not relevant to you. We tried suppressing the obligation to give feedback but the results were terrible: curators shared 4 times less tracks, as if not needing to provide feedback made them not consider them for sharing as well. You're not forced to read the feedback when there's no promise to share though :) We use it first as a **proof of listening**, and to optimize the chances that the curators will consider your track for sharing!

It's possible you'd get better results on Groover with a better targeting, we can help you with this if you'd like :) Feel free to send an email to [support@groover.co](mailto:support@groover.co) with a link to your track and the type of contacts you're looking for, we can try to make a list of recommendations.

We tried suppressing the obligation to give feedback but the results were terrible: curators shared 4 times less tracks, as if not needing to provide feedback made them not consider them for sharing as well. You&amp;#39;re not forced to read the feedback when there&amp;#39;s no promise to share though :) We use it first as a &lt;strong&gt;proof of listening&lt;/strong&gt;, and to optimize the chances that the curators will consider your track for sharing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible you&amp;#39;d get better results on Groover with a better targeting, we can help you with this if you&amp;#39;d like :) Feel free to send an email to [&lt;a href=""mailto:support@groover.co""&gt;support@groover.co&lt;/a&gt;](mailto:&lt;a href=""mailto:support@groover.co""&gt;support@groover.co&lt;/a&gt;) with a link to your track and the type of contacts you&amp;#39;re looking for, we can try to make a list of recommendations. No obligation of course! :)&lt;/p&gt;

Stop the clocks! Roll away the stones! As rock’n’roll diehards, electric boogie fiends, old groovers and true believers have hoped for, I am delighted to confirm that the new Rolling Stones album is the best thing they have made since their Seventies glory days. Which, it might reasonably be argued, de facto makes it the best rock’n’ roll album of the past four decades at least.

Two singles have certainly whetted appetites, from the Start Me Up-jolt of Angry steamrollering over any possible objections, to the epic conclusion of righteous gospel monster Sweet Sound of Heaven reaching such heights of rapture that you might actually start to believe St Peter could welcome the old rogues through the pearly gates someday – all that bad behaviour and Sympathy for the Devil forgiven. Surely the fact that having the sainted Stevie Wonder on piano playing his multi-coloured socks off and Lady Gaga trilling away like a fallen angel is not even the best thing about it should confirm the Stones resurrection to even the most sceptical.

Let’s be fair, there have been plenty of wonderful individual tracks since the last thoroughly decent Stones album of original songs, 1981’s Tattoo You. They haven’t maintained their reputation as the world’s greatest rock’n’roll band on live shows alone, and 2016’s sinuous covers collection Blue and Lonesome confirmed that they remained masters of the blues groove. Hackney Diamonds, though, has that added magical something to elevate it above everything the Stones have released from 1983’s Undercover to 2005’s A Bigger Bang.

The dozen songs on offer are jam-packed with Jagger swagger, Keith Richards’s riffology, Ronnie Woods’s sleek solos, the Glimmer twins’ aching harmonies, abounding with tight rhythms, catchy melodies, snappy lyrics, dirty energy and all bound together with lightning flashes of hair-raising flair. They are certainly not trying to reinvent the (steel) wheel, but they do sound like they may have paid a visit to the Exile basement and reminded themselves what they are really good at. Scratch that – what they are the best in the business at.

Producer Andrew Watt has done a superb job of keeping the sound bright, crisp, loud, raucous and improbably modern. This is not the Stones at their most delicate or intricate, indeed, it is arguably simplistic to the point of being almost dumb, but then rock’n’roll doesn’t demand genius. It thrives on energy and feel, on lightning in a bottle stuff that can be desperately hard to capture with the separated recording style favoured in modern digital studios.

Watt built his reputation making records with the likes of such pop froth as Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus, but has lately been adapting contemporary techniques to freshen up the sound of vintage rockers including Ozzy Osbourne, Elton John and Iggy Pop. He has clearly been an enabling force here, taking a co-writing credit with Mick Jagger and Richards on the three opening songs, and playing bass on four (Richards and Woods both fulfil bass duties elsewhere, along with a couple of notable guests, including an old Beatle and an old Stone).

Paul McCartney pops up on Bite My Head Off, with a fuzzed-up bass solo driving through the thrilling middle of the Stones’s punkiest offering since they took on New Wave with 1978’s Some Girls. “Come on Paul, let’s hear something!” Jagger yells, just to make sure everybody notices that their old rival is in the ranks. Original Stones bassist Bill Wyman returns to reunite with the ghost of Charlie Watts on Live By the Sword, a throwaway number redeemed by that down and dirty rhythm section. The Stones’ late lamented drummer also appears on Mess it Up (one of two songs dug out of the vaults and gamely spruced up by Andrew Watt), driven by a fantastic stop-start Richards chordal riff before slipping into the sleekest Stones’ disco beat since Miss You.

It is lovely to hear those crisp Watts hi-hats in action but replacement drummer Steve Jordan (who has played on Richards solo projects since the early 90s) is on dynamic form throughout, absolutely driving through the wondrous Get Close To You, replete with a slashing Richards rhythm guitar riff and tight Jagger-Richards harmonies, with a sax solo from James King worthy of the late, great Bobby Keys. “Yeah!” Jagger can be heard purring in justified satisfaction at the end. The tinkling rhythm and blues piano comes courtesy of Elton John.

Depending on You is another winner, drawing out that Gram Parsons style country melancholy the Stones have feasted on over the years, bulked up with Hammond organ (from the Heartbreakers’ Benmont Tench) and lush strings. “I’m too young for dying and too old to lose,” croons the octogenarian front man, making 80 sound like the new 40. Dreamy Skies drifts deeper into those country plains, with the jet set Jagger improbably fantasising about being left alone with “an old AM radio” that “just plays Hank Williams and some bad honky tonk.”

Richards himself takes up the torch on Tell Me Straight, one of his lush, wise, deeply romantic ballads in which he wonders “is my future all in the past?” Not on this evidence, it isn’t. Driving Me Too Hard is another gem, with Richards and Woods’s guitars weaving gorgeously around Jagger’s sensitive vocal and closing out with big soul harmonies. The only misfire is arguably Whole Wide World, with an echoing 80s guitar and Jagger going full cockney to lament a lost past of “sex and gas” and, honestly, even that is better than almost anything the Stones actually put out in the 80s. “When you think the party’s over, it’s only just begun!” declares Jagger, and it sounds like a promise he is determined to keep.

The frontman is on utterly fantastic form throughout, never letting a vowel go unstretched or a groove go unpunctuated. Sweet Sound of Heaven is very much Jagger’s triumph – even with Wonder and Gaga on stellar form and a fantastic band pulling out all the stops, it is the ageless singer who leads the storm on heaven’s gates. It’s a track that belongs in the pantheon of the Stone’s very greatest hits.

It all ends in the sweetest possible fashion, with Jagger and Richards eyeball to eyeball, playing Muddy Waters Rolling Stone Blues on acoustic guitar and harmonica. This is the very song that gave the band their name, from an album the teenage Jagger was carrying under his arm when he bumped into old school friend Richards at Dartford Station on October 17, 1962, an encounter that set this particular stone a-rolling.

It could serve as a sentimental thank you and goodnight, a gorgeous bluesy swan song from a pair of musical rogues who’ve helped keep the world rocking for over 60 years, and a band that became the living definition of the most resonant and impactful musical genre of our times. Yet this album is just so full of life, so shot with love and energy, only a fool would bet against them doing it all again. The Stones roll on. All is well in the rock’n’roll world.

You're going to need vegetable tanned leather, the thicknesses are described in weight.  

The belt itself will be either an 8/9 ounce, or a 9/10 Oz. They carry belt blanks so unless you're looking into getting into the craft just get that.  

They also sell belt loops, just make sure they're for the same width as the belt.  It looks like a 1.5 inch belt width. You'll have to hunt around for that buckle, I've never seen one like that before.  The leg belt looks like it's a half inch strap, and you'll need a half inch brass buckle for it. 

The satchels look like 4/5 Oz. If you're looking to make it yourself you'll probably need a single shoulder. 

Leather work is a whole world. It's got a bunch of specific tools. Here are the things I see you'll need: 
* snap closure for the bag on the right.  Looks like it's probably a size line 24.
* (probably)  quarter inch silver D ring
* size medium line 20 antique brass rivets
* rivet setter
* 2mm hole punch for rivets, and probably 3 mm for belt holes 
* awl/pricking irons to make holes in leather
*waxed thread/ needles
* saddlemakers groover to make the line/ border around the edges
* Pro dye. Looks like Golden Brown to me.  Also need Dye Reducer to dilute it so you can apply it evenly
* a leather finish. Looks like it's tan kote but a lot of people swear by resoline 
* probably more but I'm on mobile and not sure if this info is what you're looking for.  

This isn't a terrible choice for a first project, but as you can see there are a lot of components to leather work and it can get expensive real fast.

&gt;First of all let me tell you that I loved your track!!  
It is way above the average quality of tracks i receive here on Groover, it belongs to that fab 10% of fab songs I receive!   
The song is pretty strong (not an hit or even a single, but solid nonetheless), your voice sounds really good (maybe a little forced in the performance at times, but its tone cuts through perfectly), the only doubts i have are regarding the production and the mix.  
The song is produced pretty well, but it seems to suffer of a certain flatness, for example when the chorus kicks in we do not get that dynamic push that we would get if, say  Chris Lord Alge had mixed it, the track kind of stays there in terms of power, and the chorus (although well written melodically) does not really happen as much as it in my opinion should. It could be a production issue, a mixing issue and/or a mastering issue - who knows, but it is certainly an issue that should have been solved before releasing the track, in my opinion.   
Also, the song seems to be a little to lightweight, a lot of high frequencies and not enough low frequency power, which makes to my ears the track a little weak, when it should be powerful and engaging.  
Another issue I’d like to mention is that the arrangement seems pretty busy (especially percussion/cymbals wise) in the area where the voice is frequency-wise, and while we can hear the voice really well, this issue brings in a certain ear-fatigue, and the song becomes a little tiring to listen to after a while, since there are too many elements craving for attention.   
So what I’d recommend here is to use an external experienced and very creative producer/mixer to help out in the future, or - if you do not want or cannot do that - to really really do anything possible to improve the strength of the production. The best way to do this is to CONSTANTLY reference the track you are working on with a track in the same genre that is successful and that you love (something by NIN, perhaps?), to check if your track has the same level of quality. Sorry if I am stating the obvious but only a ruthless and - i will repeat it - constant A/B comparison can improve one’s production and mixing efforts, and I believe this is something that you definitely should do. Also, it will be fun, hearing our productions improving in quality it is a great feeling! It takes time and effort, but the spiritual/personal rewards are immense if we love music.  
I am sorry if my feedback - which, please let me state this again, is purely my personal opinion!! - is not 100% positive, even though, as i said, I loved the track!! But I hope what i wrote will prove constructive, and that it will help you forge a path that will lead you to create even stronger tracks!!",[],,0.0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This response was absolutely insane... track was produced and mixed by an award-winning producer/engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

I think on the one hand you are absolutely right that there are many curators on groover who just want to skim the money for a short review of your song. You can often tell by the copy/paste responses you get, which contain some generalities about your song and a refusal based on taste. 

You can also see it in the numbers. There are curators who add less than 4% of submissions to their playlists and probably from people who have known them for a while.

For them groover is a nice side income, but nothing more.   


I have made the experience that if you target medium playlists (up to 10 000 followers), you get quite good results. This way I got share rate of about 25% at groover. But, of course, they usually don't have a big impact on your streaming numbers (maybe 100 streams over time) and then you have to decide if it's worth it to you. 

What I find absolutely annoying about groover is that there are always people there who very enthusiastically promise to share your song and it just doesn't happen and the support at groover recommends you just write to the curators again. So by now I have 7 promises on my list that will probably never be fulfilled. There is simply no way to hold the curators accountable to their promise. 

Another very annoying thing on groover is, that there are curators that share your song on a playlist called ""groover selection/discoveries/blablabla"" that has 500 songs and 15 followers und you realize you just ended up on a graveyard created to earn all these nice groover credits from desperate musicians.   


What I have had very good experiences with, however, is contacting bloggers on groover. And since you said you're very active on social media, that's always nice to share and just gives you more presence, so maybe you might try that.

Of course your own targtetted marketing strategy should pay off more ( You seen Tom Dupree iii ) as you have total control over where you send promo to, and essentially if your material is in demand people will follow it regardless of Groover or anyone else.

Anyhow....I know Dorian ( the Groover guy) floats around these forums so maybe he will chip in, I can say that in my limited discussions with the Groover team there seems to be an intent at least to get the artist what they want.

That said, Im probably a small time curator in the scheme of things, but even I get a LOT of submission every week, I simply have to reject some as there not enough time, but there is clearly a business model here.

Feel free to DM me if you would like to discuss, or ...just send me a track , Good Luck with your music .

Yes. When I was taught shoemaking we were told you don’t really need a shank until you get to about 20-25mm heel height.

&gt;Should I do stitch down or welted? 

I think stitchdown is what we called veldtschoen? It’s up to you. The aesthetic is slightly different. A different amount of work and different level of “waterproof ness” for example. Stitchdown would only be one round of hand stitching whereas Goodyear would be two. 

&gt;Is neoprene contact cement good enough for all the application if I'm stitching on my outsole? 

you can make shoes solely using contact cement. So yes. it’s important to apply it properly though, I assume you know the ins and outs of that if you’ve been resoling but just in case - make sure the adhesive is thinned out enough. Apply one thin coat to both surfaces and let dry for 24h. Apply another thin coat to both surfaces and allow to dry 24h. Then heat activate both. Press together under pressure ideally for 40mins.

&gt;What's the best way to cut a thread groove into outsoles? 

using a leather groover, hand tool. I’ve found in some soling leathers it works better dry and on others it’s better wet. Or you can use a knife to cut an angled slit around the edge and then sew in there and then hammer the slit over the thread when done.

&gt;Do I need a toe stiffener if I'm doing a cap toe, and don't care about the toe shape lasting forever? 

If the toe cap is an extra layer and you don’t care about the shape forever then no  

&gt;Do I need a thermoplastic heel stiffener, or can I just use leather?

No. You can use leather. 

&gt;Which seams can I skip the skiving, if any?

None. If you do you will have unsightly bulk, and have difficulty folding seams. The toe cap doesn’t need to be skived though if it’s intentionally a top layer.

That Hawaiian legislature was known as the Committee of Safety, made up entirely of all rich white businessmen/ministers/lawyers/foreign nationals, ran by Mr Dole Pineapple, himself. The “Hawaiian Subjects” in the group just meant they were rich white dudes born on the islands. 
That party stripped the monarchy of authority of their own kingdom previously and when Queen Lili`uokalani came to the throne she wanted to restore that power as well as employ taxes on these rich white guys who had their sugar/pineapple plantations on Hawaiian land, made all their profits, and paid no taxes on it to the Kingdom. 

Grand-daddy Dole didn’t like that so he led a coup with against the monarchy (130 years ago this year), with the help of US Marines and Navy and put the Queen under house arrest until she agreed to their terms. Leading to as mentioned above, Republic of Hawaii and “annexation”. Then President Groover was against these actions but didn’t want to do anything by force, the next president, McKinley, was for it being annexed. In 1896 the Hawaiian language was banned in school instruction, which led to it almost going extinct until the Hawaiian renaissance in the 1970s and a modern one going on currently. 

Basically America says it’s anti-imperialism, unless we do it.

This has been recognized by both the US and the UN as an illegal overthrow/occupation, fraudulent annexation of a sovereign nation and…. That’s about all it’s done.

There are more specialized blade tools you can pick up, but an x-acto will be a good start, just make sure you keep the blade very sharp. 

A swivel knife is a rather specialized tool, but there really isn't a substitute. You use it to cut the design into the surface of the leather when carving a design.

You'll need some leather stamps, there are many different kinds with different purposes. If leather carving isn't something you want to get into right away, there are bordering stamps and pattern stamps, such as basketweave pattern, that you can use to make very nice pieces. There are stamps used more specifically for carving, as well.

A leather mallet or maul, which is how you stamp your stamps into your leather.

A piece of hard stone, such as granite, with a smooth, flat surface, which serves as a working surface when stamping leather. Check out local countertop or other home-masonry type stores. They often have pieces that have broken off and are basically unusable to them that they may part with at a discount, or maybe even for free. 

Pricking irons or diamond chisels are used for creating the holes for stitching a piece.

A leather hole punch or hole punch set. 

Leatherworking needles, also for stitching.

And edge groover will make stitching much more organized. 

Edge bevels can mask a multitude of errors. 

Edge burnishers turn sharp, rough edges of pieces into smooth soft ones, if used properly. 

Pattern kits are a good idea to get started on various projects.

Various leather dyes, antique finishes, and finishing compounds can make a piece really gorgeous. 

If there's a Tandy's leather supply near you, they'll likely have most or all of what I described, and will likely give you some tips on how to use the tools. Many locations also offer classes and/or workshops. You can also order most of these tools online from various sources.

YouTube is also a good resource for learning the basics of various techniques. Everything requires practice and patience.

1. Mark a line using either wing dividers or groover following the edge of your project at about 1/8” or 3mm in from the edge.

2. Ensure your pricking irons or stitching awl (whatever you use to actually make the hole) is perfectly up and down. If you slant it you could break out the side of the leather or at very least have it look really good on the top and horrible on the bottom.

3. Overlap your holes by using one or two of the previous holes already made. This will take longer, but ensures perfect spacing from hole to hole. If it is even a little off it is very noticeable and sticks out like a soar thumb.

Mainly because I did my research and have been doing it this specific way and it has been quite successful for me as well as many other artists.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are just starting off, you should release a new single every 4-6 weeks. The reasons why are simple: if you upload your release at least 4 weeks before release, you can also pitch to Spotify Editorials. Also, you can be on release radar for 4 week on each new release which means you will get 4 weeks of plays. Also 4 weeks is a great time to promote your music. I use sites like Groover and Submit hub to pitch my music to curators and I run an Instagram Ads campaign to get new listeners to my song. I run this campaign and am usually on playlists for 4-6 weeks. Then, you release your next single and repeat.

&amp;#x200B;

Every 4th release, you should release your new song as an EP with your last 3 releases. This will refresh/rerelease your first 3 songs with your new song and all 4 will be on release radar which gives you an even bigger bump in organic streams. And of course, keep on promoting your song. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would also add that social media promotion is always good. Utilize Instagram Reels, Tiktok vids, and YouTube shorts. Honestly this can be hit or miss but you never know if one of your videos will go viral. I used to release a reel a day promoting my music but it got way too exhausting so I just stopped and usually post 1-3 videos per release and spend most of my time pitching to playlists and running ads. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once you get to the final song of your album, you will have about 3 or 4 EPs, with about 12-16 songs (or however large your album is), then you just release EVERY SINGLE SONG as an album. Now you are re-releasing every song you ever released with 1 final song, compiled into an album. 

&amp;#x200B;

And so to answer your first question I would have releases prepared. Like if you have 4 songs completely done, you have 4 months of release. Right now I have about 20 songs written and it takes me about 2 weeks to completely record, mix and master my song so I usually work within that time line. I have released 10 songs over the last year, 1 song every 6 weeks. Initially, it wasn't very successful because I was still building a network of curators and learning how to get my promotion strategy right, but eventually it took off. My top song is currently at 40k streams (over 6 months). But I released a song in July and it is already at 26k streams. Eventually your streams will trickle over to long term growth. On my Spotify for Artists dashboard, I am on over 722 Spotify Playlists over the last 28 days. I remember when I was just on 20 for my 1st release. But if you use this strategy, you are telling the Spotify algorithm that you are consistent and it will help you tremendously down the road.",[],,0.0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have the answer!

first of you probably won't touch a saw for a little while. if you have no experience you will start off dragging cords, hoses, tools and all kinds of other shit around.  you'll spend plenty of time pulling slabs and vacuuming slurry.  

eventually you will learn to core drill.  core drilling is cheap and easy, so it is where people learn the basics of cutting with diamond tools.  while core drilling you will eventually get to a hand saw, but mostly piddly shit on the ground, small areas where you can't get a walk behind saw or places where it is feasible to transport one.  eventually you'll get the hang of it and start doing wall openings or pipe cuts

walk behind saw also known as slabsaw or flatsaw  is usually the last part that turns you into a basic 3 tool operator.  Slabsaws excell at laying down vast footages on flat ground.  most people only ever make it to this level of cutting, either because they don't have the mental capacity to learn further tools, physical limitations or they just excel so much at it they become to valuable to do anything else.

wall saws you mount a track to whatever you wish to cut, attach the saw to the track and it follows.  back in the day we had the old heavy dumb sons of bitches that ran off of hydraulics and you hand cranked them along the track.  they have mostly been phased out by newer, lighter, more powerful electric saws, but there are plenty of poor bastards that use them.  these saws are what you use when you need large openings cut perfectly, think a loading dock door.

the wire saw is the creme de la creme.  anything any size you want to cut you can cut.  as long as you have enough wire, pulleys and imagination.  this is the shit you use to cut a fucking dam in half or large bridge piers.

Ajer more than a decade of shaping their brand of hypno\]cally-charged house with ethnic undercurrents – both individually and as a duo – Mira &amp; Chris follow up their 2020 summer hit ‘Déia’ with a long-awaited 5-tracker on Kiosk ID. ‘Cleo’ features two originals and three eclec\]c remixes by Argia, Hardt Antoine, and Jonathan Kaspar for catalog number 020.  
  
‘Cleo’ epitomizes the slow-burning aesthe\]c Mira &amp; Chris are known for in their B2B DJ-sets across the world. Contras\]ng darkly ominous chords with playful blips, organic percussion, and radiant synth progressions, ‘Cleo’ opens up airy worlds of mesmeric explora\]on anchored in a sub-heavy groove.  
  
Hardt Antoine’s up-tempo rendi\]on of ‘Cleo’ aroully reinterprets the original’s underlying tension. Cascades of rippling percussion, tearing sirens, thundering sub-hits, and a crackling electronica beat conjure waves of boSled-up energy that constantly threaten escala\]on.  
  
With ‘Jero’, Mira &amp; Chris explore deeper climes. Brightly shimmering chords and a resonant lead synth conjure an infec\]ous, evolving mantra framed by a compact beat. Aroully threading the needle between danceable, transcendental, and uplijing, ‘Jero’ showcases Mira &amp; Chris’s ability to turn subtle tension arcs into sprawling auditory journeys.  
  
Jonathan Kaspar reduces ‘Jero’ to its base-most elements and reimagines the original as a stripped, introspec\]ve groover. Mangled blips, warm pads, and beau\]fully resona\]ng salvos of malfunc\]oning machinery intertwine to create the soundtrack for a sunrise on a distant world.  
  
Argia’s Powerbeats Version infuses ‘Jero’ with harsher soundscapes and industrial undercurrents. Clanging percussion, washed-out vocal effects, and a building break imbue ‘Jero’ with searing edge and peak-\]me quali\]es.  
  
Mira &amp; Chris Schwarzwalder are synonymous with some of the most hypno\]c experiences in electronic music. ‘ Cleo’ delivers two slow-burning groovers and three eclec\]c reimagina\]ons that spearhead these experiences, showcasing Mira &amp; Chris’s ability to weave mesmerizing energy arcs, and conjure unparalleled dance floor moments.

This is a recent review of the site with some handy tips on there - &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtiZBbGYBAM""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtiZBbGYBAM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The social media algorithms are stacked against you, even to reach your own followers. You will have to pay to reach them and find new listeners. This guy is an amazing resource for all things social media advertisting on various platforms, as well as how to market yourself as an independent producer/musician - &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/@AndrewSouthworth""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/@AndrewSouthworth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally make sure your music is great - cream has a tendency to rise to the top.&lt;/p&gt;

Some mallets or deadblow hammers (i use harbor freight)
Stitch groovers or edge creasers
Punches (I'd suggest diamond chisel as they are relatively cheap and effective)
Leather needles (blunt with longer eyes)
Waxed thread (tiger is great but pricey)
Pen knives/box cutters/roller cutters
Straight edges
Punch mats/pads
Cut mats
Scissors (cut thread)
Lighters (burn ends of thread)

Optionals (based on leather selection and preferences) 
Burnishing tools

Leather is sold by sqr foot but some places may offer packages such as Springfields journal.makers leather package. Get extra as the shape isn't square and there will be waste, specifically if cutting down to fit your laser bed.

Amazon has lots of.kits and sets for relatively cheap (sometimes you get what you pay for so buyer beware).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic list from my perspective:
Some mallets or deadblow hammers (i use harbor freight)
Stitch groovers or edge creasers
Punches (I&amp;#39;d suggest diamond chisel as they are relatively cheap and effective)
Leather needles (blunt with longer eyes)
Waxed thread (tiger is great but pricey)
Pen knives/box cutters/roller cutters
Straight edges
Punch mats/pads
Cut mats
Scissors (cut thread)
Lighters (burn ends of thread)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optionals (based on leather selection and preferences) 
Burnishing tools

I think one of my favorite things about leather work is that you can get going for super cheap but *CAN* invest more for improvements if you really get into it.

You can do basic leather working with just a knife, a needle, and a drill or ice pick to poke holes.

But you can do really nice stuff just with a few basic proper tools like a stitch groover, pricking iron or stitching chisel, an edge beveler, an edge slicker, and a leather punch. Those few tools are probably like $75 all together for the cheap ones and those things are what instantly took my leather work from looking like an okay DIY project to people asking me where I bought the leather item from.

Add in some basic hardware and supplies like rivets and thread and needles and some kind of rivet-setting device, and leather dye and finishers and you're probably around $125-150... and you may not even be using rivets and a rivet-setter depending on what you're making.

The biggest up front cost is buying the leather but, if you plan to make lots of leather stuff for yourself, you end up saving boat loads compared to buying finished leather products. Like, for me, making sheaths for the knives I've made end up costing me like $5-10 a sheath vs buying one or having a custom one made for $50-150+",[],,0.0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For leather working?&lt;/p&gt;

Then the amateurs:

[Audioxide](https://audioxide.com/reviews/kate-bush-hounds-of-love/):  Three reviewers, all of them name it as one of their favorite songs on the album.

[Progarchives](http://www.progarchives.com/album.asp?id=9801):  Not a review but a message board.  The track is unanimously praised there.

[Moggblog](https://moggblog.com/2018/02/07/kate-bush-hounds-of-love-classic-album-review/):  I'm not mentioning reviews that just tell where the song fits in the story of The Ninth Wave (which is most of the reviews), nor ones that just review everything together without specifically giving an opinion on the track.  I will point out this one, though, because it calls the production on the song ""Amazing.""

[XSNoise](https://www.xsnoize.com/classic-album-kate-bush-hounds-of-love/):  ""The song is heart-rendering and beautiful.""

[Loudersound](https://www.loudersound.com/features/kate-bush-40-greatest-songs-of-all-time/2):  They list it as ""one of the 40 best Kate Bush songs.""

\&gt; figure out your brand, target audience, creating good content and establishing a relationship with your fans.

I'm a promoter/manager for a couple of bands that write experimental/psychedelic rock music with a keen sense of melody. Most of them go back as far as the 90s and put out plenty of material on different labels. In other words no one I'm promoting is an amateur, they mostly got songwriting part figured out/play shows actively. 

I neglected Spotify in the past and I still think they should pay artists better. With that said, it proves a nice path to visibility. I saw Spotify number rising lately for people I'm promoting and its no coincidence, because I'm focusing heavily on that platform now.

\&gt; playlists are cool but very very rarely move the needle as artists seem to expect these days.

There are playlists like Experimental Fresh Finds and Modern Psychedelia that are exactly what I'm looking for, but I assume getting onto those won't be easy/I'll need to pay money. 

\&gt; so many of my artists land on them only to circle back because they didn't get the exposure they expected.

Fair enough - I paid Groover and so far its 1 placement out of 5. The problem is...artist I'm promoting is at #262 and in a list that mentions hip-hop/beats, though they're not a hip-hop band at all. Ton of likes for that playlist, though, so who knows...

In general, I agree - ""Its better to better to be seen/heard by 10 people that are here for you, than 100 that aren't"", in the words of one of my artistic buds.

I still like to mark the leather first if the groove isn't going to go all the way to the leather's edge so that it's easier to see where to stop cutting.
* If you use stitching chisels, you can just start lining the chisel up along the line (or groove) and it'll handle the spacing by itself. I'd recommend this for beginners, using an awl is a bit more difficult (though also a skill worth learning) and can be discouraging if you're just starting out.
* If don't have or don't want to use chisels, you can use a pricking iron which is basically the same tool as a stitching chisel except it's not meant to actually puncture the leather. They come in a variety of lengths, and can help you have more uniform stitching.

* You can also use a stitching chisel as a pricking iron if you prefer to use a hand awl and also have chisels. Instead of hammering it through the leather, just press the chisel into the leather enough to leave a mark, then go in with the awl to puncture it.

- [9MOTHER9HORSE9EYES9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9MOTHER9HORSE9EYES9) ([link to official subreddit, where you can start reading](https://old.reddit.com/r/9M9H9E9/comments/4lnr05/hello_and_welcome_to_r9m9h9e9_feeling_lost_start/)): Surreal and horrifying story about flesh interfaces and LSD, among many other things, originally posted on Reddit. An internet classic.
- [I Am in Eskew](https://www.iamineskew.com/transcripts) - Horror podcast about a man trapped in an eldritch city. Depressing and gruesome, but beautiful. I read the transcripts instead of listening, since I'm not a big podcast fan, and still loved it.
- [City of Angles](https://stefangagne.com/cityofangles/) - Horror web serial about another eldritch city with a non-Euclidean bent. First volume is extremely fun, but the second and third got tiring and I don't recommend them.
- [SCP Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCP_Foundation) - If you don't know what this is, do you even spend time on the Internet? Quality is extremely mixed, but the [top rated pages](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/top-rated-pages) are great to start with, for web horror aficionados.
- [17776](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/17776) ([official site](https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football)) - Sci-fi story about football in a far-future Earth. I liked this one for the concept more than the execution, it gets a bit too sentimental in my opinion, but the introduction and opening sequence are fantastic.

If you're partial to webcomics (note that none of these are finished stories, all are still updating):

- [Gunnerkrigg Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunnerkrigg_Court) ([official site](https://www.gunnerkrigg.com/?p=1)): Science-fantasy webcomic about two children who attend a mysterious boarding school. Witty off-beat humor. I liked this one when I was younger. The art gets better, I swear.
- [Kill 6 Billion Demons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_Six_Billion_Demons) ([official site](https://killsixbilliondemons.com/comic/kill-six-billion-demons-chapter-1/)): Weird fantasy webcomic inspired by Hindu mythology. ""God Is Dead. Far beyond Earth, the multiverse is in chaos as criminals rule and callous kings maintain a fragile peace. One day, a mysterious and bloody figure appears to a barista named Allison Wanda Ruth, and bestows her with an Ancient Artifact known as the Key of Kings. In the process, Allison finds herself suddenly transported to the final resting place of the gods in the exact center of the multiverse, the red city of Throne.""
- [Awful Hospital](https://bogleech.com/awfulhospital/intro): Interactive webcomic in the style of Homestuck, about a mother who finds herself in a nightmarish hospital after trying to save her infant son from a mysterious illness. Cartoony with copious amounts of body horror. Do not recommend reading and eating at the same time.

If you don't mind interactive fiction:

- [Summit](http://www.phantomwilliams.com/summit.html) ([IFDB page with reviews and ratings](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=asfrcp17gktrdt1d)): Weird fantasy story where you journey towards an elusive mountain summit. Setting is a surreal and beautiful world not quite our own. Everyone has fish living in their stomachs, for example.
- [Computerfriend](https://slugzuki.itch.io/computerfriend) ([IFDB page](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=qupd7qqd1cdc8rev)): ""The year is 1999. The place is Godfield, Louisiana: the tech capital of the world, where the sky bleeds acid and the mud boils in the bayou. It’s time for your state-mandated digital therapy."" Sci-fi set in a dying alternate America full of cyberpunk flourishes, where you play as a severely depressed person receiving therapy from the titular AI.
- [Chandler Groover's stories](http://www.castleprincessdragon.com/interactivefiction.html). Some of these are more gamey than others, involving puzzles and bad endings, but these two are short and accessible even if you know nothing about interactive fiction: [Hunting Unicorn](http://cmg.itch.io/hunting-unicorn) ([IFDB page](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=jdmlt99bhvcg8p0b)), where you play as a virgin used as bait in unicorn hunting, and [Bring Me A Head!](http://www.castleprincessdragon.com/InteractiveFiction/BringMeAHead/Bring-Me-A-Head.html) ([IFDB page](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=vhud0bjh6zdz702z)), where you play as a servant in a decrepit fairytale castle.

The fewer cords the less bullshit environment to work in. Notice how the job site debris always finds a way to collect alongside the cord on the ground? When you roll that cord up quick at the end of the day without gloves and for some fucking reason a piece of tape with metal shavings give you a splinter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Break the prong on your ground and you don&amp;#39;t fix it, the GC safety guy will come clip your cord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have one cord to plug in everyday and it&amp;#39;s my cart power station. Everything is managed neatly and keeps me sane &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck cords.&lt;/p&gt;

1. Social media content
2. Paid social ads
3. Curator marketing

1. Social media - aim for creating 40-60 short form video clips for each song. This if very often not that time intensive, just performing the song in a cool place and chopping it into pieces...

2. Paid ads - If you had $1,000 put $900 into Facebook (Meta) ads and $100 into YouTube ads. TikTok / Snapchat ads also work, but they're more expensive than Facebook ads per result. Focus on conversion campaigns driving people directly to Spotify from a landing page.

3. Curator marketing - If you're in a genre that fits cleanly into a box, reach out to playlists / blogs / YouTube channels to share your song.   
This could be either done through email, or through platforms like SubmitHub and Groover. This could also include 3rd party playlisting companies, but just remember its hard to tell who is a good vs bad actor in this space. Budget-wise keep this much smaller than your ads.

I'm a big fan of the ads, but of course they require a budget. Additionally there is a learning curve with them if you've never done them before. But with them i've driven hundreds of millions of streams.

To get the full range you need to average 2.4 miles / kWh which is doable with mostly city driving. The faster you drive, the more air resistant and you lose milage. Probably like 260-280 miles @ 65mph. Texas has 80mph freeways so you’ll get less if you’re doing that. In town I’ll get 360+ miles.

My energy rates are expensive here in CA, $0.32 / kWh. So $42 for a “full charge.”

Alternatively you could use an acrylic finish to both color and protect the leather (just be careful, it can be easy to overdo, and definitely test on a piece of scrap so you know how the pigment absorbs into the leather).   


A few things you could do for your next project would be to finish your edges with a beveler and slicker in order to get rid of those ragged bits (some people also torch their edges, but that's optional imo), use a v-groover to carve a trench for your stitch-holes, use a tracing wheel to evenly space out holes within that groove, and maybe look into using cordage instead of the waxed thread (waxed thread is perfectly fine, but cordage has a bit more of a finished look I think).

Alternatively you could use an acrylic finish to both color and protect the leather (just be careful, it can be easy to overdo, and definitely test on a piece of scrap so you know how the pigment absorbs into the leather).   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few things you could do for your next project would be to finish your edges with a beveler and slicker in order to get rid of those ragged bits (some people also torch their edges, but that&amp;#39;s optional imo), use a v-groover to carve a trench for your stitch-holes, use a tracing wheel to evenly space out holes within that groove, and maybe look into using cordage instead of the waxed thread (waxed thread is perfectly fine, but cordage has a bit more of a finished look I think). Also, you might look into getting a leather pony and looking up how to do a saddle stitch--that way if one stitch breaks, the rest don&amp;#39;t lose structural integrity.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very impressive work, well done!&lt;/p&gt;

From my albeit limited research you have a few legit ways.

1. Submitting to playlists which you can do through Spotify or with sites like Submithub or Groover. This costs money once you're out of Spotify.
2. Running ads on a social platforms and driving people to your music (also costs money).
3. Playing live and hoping people are able / interested in finding and following you.
4. Using an existing or newly created social media platform to get friends/followers.

Without work and/or money IDK of any way to get significant followers. If you have no social following and you aren't able to produce high engagement content in the form of TikTok videos that people WANT to watch then you're best bet is playlist submissions.

I've had *luck* with Submit hub in that 50% of my music gets placed (which is almost double the average) but that has amounted to a few hundred plays per song per month. 

That's a few hundred more than I'd have gotten without it cause I have no social and I don't play live so I'm happy with it but the notion that people are going to hear your music and it's going to blow up and go viral is sort of like hitting the lottery.

**The Golden Toadstools** “Silly Savage” b/w “Weeping River” 1969 Quality Records Canada


A one off good time funk jam by this mysterious studio band. The A side is boogie groover, with tons of crazy lyrics. It’s 
awesome.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gkWHnFK4EOs

The flip is a moody number with organ, vocals reminiscent of Elvis and a spooky atmosphere.

Anyway, yeah, I think everyone has favourites. I'll post **a bunch**. I really love this game.

Mind you, soundTeMP are considered experimental by some, so there are some strong contrasts between a bunch of songs.

[1. Login Menu](https://youtu.be/a9OdzOz-9-I) There are only so few songs that I think are liked by literally everyone who has played the game. It's that kind of feeling that you're about to go on a wonderful journey; even if you've been there already, it's always welcoming. 

[2. Prontera Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D30M_vLMvWk) I wasn't a Prontera citizen, but I know the majority of potential players would hunt me down if I didn't put this up high. This is the main city. This is where most of the player merchants crowd the sidewalks, and and and. You even can get married here! 

[3. Woodsy starter area](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN2WlkJosF8) I like these videos, because a few in-game noises here and there kinda shake my nostalgia awake and near tears, lmao.

[4. Casino beach city; Comodo](https://youtu.be/dHa6oRMXCW8) Yeah, this is a Sonic level basically, lol. 

[5. Juno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmUCmSFDLKU) I honestly didn't play when this city was released, but I've recently played on a server and the sheer size of the new cities absolutely deserves something so bombastic. This is where your characters eventually transcend, which is basically going back to level 1, to level up as a stronger, second class.

[6. Christmas... Dungeon?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89Aaio1Dqac) Okay, so I got fucking PTSD from this area, but I still respect that it was trying to mash up something... I like it? As long as I don't have to hunt either of the timed mobs.

[7. Dancing Christmas in the 13th Month](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZSRM6r9V80) This, however, has nothing to do with Christmas. This is a **certified banger** and probably one of my all-time favourite songs to grind to. This is a particular higher level area, and you're going up against some Halloween ass monsters. But, to me, it definitely has a certain adrenaline pumping quality that can only be stopped by needing to get a drink or needing to go to the bathroom. I still listen to this every so often, sometimes during workout lmao.

[8. Backattack!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H-KKNcCno0) I like string instruments, okay?

[9. Payon ](https://youtu.be/ag0sB__QWQg) My home town for most of my childhood time playing the game. Although this shows new Payon, upgraded in size, it still uses the same sweet song. 

And hey guess what, 

[10. Ancient Groover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK0BH9Ymz7k) A song that literally gets me teary-eyed. This is Payon Dungeon, the upper levels, and it's just got that very nice flow from Payon's town theme into an adjacent dungeon feeling.

[11. Mucho Gusto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VBEyRymdlY) Finally, we're at the beach! Just outside Comodo, where we find penguins slurping juice (no, really, check out these [cute fuckers](https://ratemyserver.net/index.php?page=mob_db&amp;mob_id=1391)) and seals trying to murder you because you forgot that just because it's cute doesn't mean it's not stronger than the rest here.

[12. Rag All Night Long](https://youtu.be/M72hG_UNMdg) I would play this game all night long if this song is playing. This is on the same wavelength as 7. to me. It literally will take an offline miracle for me to stop.

So, we're almost done here, the rest, which is a lot, believe me, you can probably explore on your own.

Buuuuuut, RO players will once again hunt me down if I do not mention [13. Wanna be Free!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gp1_Go-F_iU) 
So, there are guilds, check, and they go to war over castles, check. The guitars and tempo really have created some long-lasting memories of doing international warfare for a few hours every week or so. At least the rewards were very worth it, along access to exclusive guild dungeons and then some! Luckily, this song has some insane drive. 

Okay, thank you if you checked out even only one of them. This is like asking me about Magic the Gathering, or some other niche hobby like ProjectMoon stuff.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Wait, you're still here? [Sleepless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_3XXSbveDA)

So, this is a special little track that I think gets zero attention when people talk about the game's soundtrack and their favourite songs. It's a little area that's supposed to connect a tree dungeon and the Halloween land that I linked a song above for. You're literally in Yggrasil! There's a bunch of plants, and no actual monsters. Plants do drop stuff, too. Anyway, this song goes some places that are just almost wasted on an area that no one stays in for long. And vocals, lol. This shit is too groovy.

I receive a ton of great tracks that artists submit without obviously taking the time to flip through my playlists, read my blog or listen to the radio show, someting I totally understand, as time is an issue, especially if you are submitting to many curators. So my feedback can often be complimentary with a refusal at the end, due to suitability. Often the quality is great but it's a bit too commercial, sometimes a track is great but the vocal is a bit too generic. It doesn't mean that I don't appreciate the music, but I have to give a reason for refusal. Sometimes it's quite hard to quantify, it's just a vibe or feel, and then I'm trying to do this without offending the artist. It's quite a tricky thing to do when you are dealing with 400-600 submissions a month in my case, with many of the tracks being pretty poor quality. If you are bored then go through your Release Radar sometime, and write a yes or no+a reason why for each one, then multiply that by three. There are a lot of curators that receive far more submissions than me and to be honest I'm not sure how they do it, listening to lots of bad/average/good music to find the great tunes is quite mentally demanding. 

On top of that I follow 160 blogs, check the weekly release lists from several record shops, follow social media for tips, folllow 3500 artists, labels and fans on Bandcamp, 100s on Soundcloud and that's before all the 100s of weekly emails from artists, labels and PR companies that I receive. The competition is fierce so even if a track is good or great it's not always going to make the cut if there are a few better tracks. I can't lie mood also plays a part, sometimes I just want a vibe.

Don't forget as well that not all of the curators are English so translation might be an issue. Not all the curators might be well educated so expression or linguistic subtety/accuracy might be an issue? Maybe the curator is having a hard week - the dog died, they are sick, tired, there could be a million reasons the feedback isn't perfect.

Lastly as an artist I would say don't take it personally. Online communication/text messaging between people with no personal contact is open to a lot of interpretation and quite often an artists reaction is more about frustration about lack of success or recognition, often after years of practise or grinding, life is hard and rejection always hurts. As a label I deal with feedback that hurts as I want the tracks to be successful for my artists, for whom I feel a lot of responsibility, so I don't actually read most of it, apart from a few curators that I feel are more key to a tracks success and who I know whose judgement - bad or good, I can trust and respect. Then if it's a refusal I just shrug my shoulders and carry on hustling.

Submithub and Groover are actually quite unique in that you get feedback on a track, which makes them easy targets for artistic frustration. I send out hundreds of emails for each release to blogs, magazine, curators, tastemakers, playlisters, podcasters and radio stations and my response rate with feedback is probably around 1% and I often miss radio plays or it takes me a while to realise there is some coverage.

The modern music landscape is ridiculously tough to crack, the industry is hard to navigate and there has never been more competition - cover all bases, don't take it personally and keep grinding - that's often the main difference between those that make it and those that don't, dealing with 10 years of rejection before coming an ""overnight success.""",[],,0.0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know I won&amp;#39;t get any sympathy and that&amp;#39;s fine but being a curator is really tricky.

I really enjoyed this years regionals. The name of the game should be college pitching.

All in MLB top 200

Juaron Watts-Brown -  is a strike out machine like we like

Hunter Owen - great big lefty with some confidence issues once runners get on (sound familiar). He might slide do some injury concerns and likely asking for over slot bonus.

Cade Kuehler - just a great all around pitcher. I think he can be quickly fast tracked to the majors.

Tanner Witt - has all the talent in the world and rushed back from TJ making his junior year look a little unimpressive. Looked good as a freshman but hasn't pitched a lot of innings since. Another name that could slide do to being unknown.

For bats - Lujames groover III is a fun player. He can mash the baseball and is just a fun personality in general

Not in MLB top 200

Trennor O'Donnell aka ""big tex"" (6'7"")  is a pick a senior and a great pick for the 4/5th round probably (baseball is hard to project because of slot values).

alberto rios - C for stanford looks incredible so I am not really sure why he isn't better regarded.

Brayden Wimmer - Another just fun player at SS for South carolina. He has that clutch factor in him. Definitely a name to grab.

&amp;#x200B;

Off the top of my head. Something like this

Keuhler in the first for under slot

watts- brown in the second for around slot value

owen/witt in the third for over slot value

O'Donnell -4

Rios -5

&lt;p&gt;Juaron Watts-Brown -  is a strike out machine like we like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hunter Owen - great big lefty with some confidence issues once runners get on (sound familiar). He might slide do some injury concerns and likely asking for over slot bonus.&lt;/p&gt;

Here’s what you need to feel totally sure he’s faking it: 

[SpotOnTrack](https://spotontrack.com) 
It’s an analytic tool where you can search playlists by their name or URL, and it will show you how many followers that playlist has gotten over time. Any dips or spikes in increments larger than 100 a day indicates bots. I’ve busted so many people trying to push fake promo using this site. You can even check the Instagram of artists to see similar statistics.

Another great tool for this kind of stuff is this:
[Is It A Good Playlist](https://isitagoodplaylist.com)

Here you can see the same backend data on playlists, but it also lets you search playlists you can SUBMIT to (meaning it’s not a Payola, or a pay-for-play, which btw is what your boy fake-Shawn-Mendez is doing) and you can search for specific playlists that are listed on trusted submission sites like Groover, and on isitagoodplaylist, you can verify the audience for that playlist before you ever submit. And when I say verify the audience, I don’t just mean looking to see if the followers have done the natural 0-to-whatever-number climb over time — I mean you can even see who’s on the playlist, what artists you’ll be related to due to that playlist, and more. Now you can use this to carve your own path to a (bot free!) Spotify growth — or you can just use it to snoop on the playlists fake-Shawn gets added to (which admittedly is why I bought the pro subscription).

Getting bot playlists adds does not equal success as an artist because labels can’t sell merch and concert tickets to a bot audience, so you ruin your chance of a record deal with that. And you can’t even successfully be an independent artist with bot playlists, because the “listeners also like” section is corrupted by bots, and that data is what Spotify’s algorithmic playlists use to decide who to show your song to when you’re on Release Radar (tier 2) and Discover Weekly (tier 1 and 2). Also - Spotify will only let you get away with this for so long. Once you are getting enough bot plays that you’re costing them real money (from paying out revenues for the bot plays) then they shut your account down. 

Email support@spotify.com to report Fake Shawn and (given his stream count) he will likely be shut down. It’s a little more tricky to get Spotify to care when their monthly listeners are below 50,000 — but you’re in luck. They very much care about anyone faking it at a level above 100,000 monthly listeners, because that costs SPOTIFY some real money. 

Just remember, fake Shawn has no real audience. Just bots. And so, he has what we call in the music business “vanity metrics” — and that is not a term used kindly. 

I’m dealing with this myself like I said. It’s disheartening to pour money into advertising with mediocre results and to have to shop around for playlists that you can verify as organic and then submit to them hoping they want your song — and then to see fake-Shawn’s just taking no kind of time or care and having twice the results to show for it. But just remember - it’s not real. And it’s meaningless if it’s not real. It’s an arms race in this industry, but I have to believe realness will prevail.

They very much care about anyone faking it at a level above 100,000 monthly listeners, because that costs SPOTIFY some real money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember, fake Shawn has no real audience. Just bots. And so, he has what we call in the music business “vanity metrics” — and that is not a term used kindly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m dealing with this myself like I said. It’s disheartening to pour money into advertising with mediocre results and to have to shop around for playlists that you can verify as organic and then submit to them hoping they want your song — and then to see fake-Shawn’s just taking no kind of time or care and having twice the results to show for it. But just remember - it’s not real. And it’s meaningless if it’s not real. It’s an arms race in this industry, but I have to believe realness will prevail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;

Lo que le agregaría/cambiaría a esos comentarios es que ahora tengo mejores tenedores, un ""groover"" (en español se le podría decir ""acanalador"" pero dejémoslo de momento como ""groover"") y un mejor martillo. Tanto el juego de tenedores como el groover los conseguí en Tiendamia. [Los tenedores](https://tiendamia.com/cr/producto?amz=B014549SNG&amp;pName=Aiskaer%20White%20Steel%204mm%201/2/4/6%20Prong%20DIY%20Diamond%20Lacing%20Stitching%20Chisel%20Set%20Leather%20Craft%20Kits) me han salido excelentes, no son los mejores pero lo importante no son las herramientas sino la habilidad. Una herramienta barata pero bien empleada rinde demasiado y da resultados muy buenos. Claro, también hay herramientas baratas que de viaje no valen la pena, pero el juego de tenedores que compré tiene buenas reseñas y puedo dar fe de que sale bueno.

[El groover que compré](https://tiendamia.com/cr/producto?amz=B073F6WCBT) tiene la ventaja de que aparte de traer la punta para hacer canales también trae 3 tamaños distintos de mata filos y un ""[edge creaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK6nv66DHiM)"". La punta para hacer canales no viene muy filosa de paquete pero con unas pasadas en un asentador de cuero con compuesto para pulir queda bien.

[El martillo](https://imgur.com/a/KC9JRGz) que compré lo conseguí en Las Gravílias como por 7 rojos y me ha salido muy bien. Es importante que el martillo NO sea de acero porque se forma un ""hongo"" en la cabeza de los tenedores y afecta su vida util. Como todo, por supuesto que existen martillos dedicados para talabartería, pero con ese que tengo me parece más que suficiente (de momento).

Lo que de momento me falta es un [pad para usar los tenedores](https://www.amazon.com/Mary-Paxton-Punching-Protection-Transparent/dp/B07MNWQQTB). Los tenedores no se pueden usar directamente sobre superficies duras (madera, granito, etc...) porque los dientes pierden el filo. De momento lo que he estado usando para hacer los huecos con los tenedores es poner un pedazo de cuero viejo debajo de la pieza que voy a trabajar para que el tenedor no haga contacto con la mesa. Pero lo ideal es tener una superficie rígida debajo del cuero (porque si usás los tenedores sobre una superficie blanda eso puedo ocasionar que el cuero se doble al momento de martillar) y que no dañe los dientes del tenedor. De momento no he tenido problemas con eso pero, repito, no es lo ideal.

Con un juego de esos te la jugás perfectamente.",[],,0.0,,False,False,"[{'a': ':cartagines:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/bzcb6rqbxw851_t5_2up3k/cartagines'}, {'e': 'text', 't': ' Cartaginés'}]",False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hace un año hice un &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Ticos/comments/uvkmtu/mis_proyectos_en_cuero_hasta_el_momento_y_algunas/""&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; en donde respondo esta misma pregunta (en los comentarios) pero como ya pasó un año me parece importante actualizar esa info:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lo que le agregaría/cambiaría a esos comentarios es que ahora tengo mejores tenedores, un &amp;quot;groover&amp;quot; (en español se le podría decir &amp;quot;acanalador&amp;quot; pero dejémoslo de momento como &amp;quot;groover&amp;quot;) y un mejor martillo. Tanto el juego de tenedores como el groover los conseguí en Tiendamia. &lt;a href=""https://tiendamia.com/cr/producto?amz=B014549SNG&amp;amp;pName=Aiskaer%20White%20Steel%204mm%201/2/4/6%20Prong%20DIY%20Diamond%20Lacing%20Stitching%20Chisel%20Set%20Leather%20Craft%20Kits""&gt;Los tenedores&lt;/a&gt; me han salido excelentes, no son los mejores pero lo importante no son las herramientas sino la habilidad. Una herramienta barata pero bien empleada rinde demasiado y da resultados muy buenos. Claro, también hay herramientas baratas que de viaje no valen la pena, pero el juego de tenedores que compré tiene buenas reseñas y puedo dar fe de que sale bueno.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://tiendamia.com/cr/producto?amz=B073F6WCBT""&gt;El groover que compré&lt;/a&gt; tiene la ventaja de que aparte de traer la punta para hacer canales también trae 3 tamaños distintos de mata filos y un &amp;quot;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK6nv66DHiM""&gt;edge creaser&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;. La punta para hacer canales no viene muy filosa de paquete pero con unas pasadas en un asentador de cuero con compuesto para pulir queda bien.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/KC9JRGz""&gt;El martillo&lt;/a&gt; que compré lo conseguí en Las Gravílias como por 7 rojos y me ha salido muy bien. Es importante que el martillo NO sea de acero porque se forma un &amp;quot;hongo&amp;quot; en la cabeza de los tenedores y afecta su vida util. Como todo, por supuesto que existen martillos dedicados para talabartería, pero con ese que tengo me parece más que suficiente (de momento).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lo que de momento me falta es un &lt;a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Mary-Paxton-Punching-Protection-Transparent/dp/B07MNWQQTB""&gt;pad para usar los tenedores&lt;/a&gt;. Los tenedores no se pueden usar directamente sobre superficies duras (madera, granito, etc...) porque los dientes pierden el filo. De momento lo que he estado usando para hacer los huecos con los tenedores es poner un pedazo de cuero viejo debajo de la pieza que voy a trabajar para que el tenedor no haga contacto con la mesa. Pero lo ideal es tener una superficie rígida debajo del cuero (porque si usás los tenedores sobre una superficie blanda eso puedo ocasionar que el cuero se doble al momento de martillar) y que no dañe los dientes del tenedor. De momento no he tenido problemas con eso pero, repito, no es lo ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

Another 'let's just jam opener' track to me. I actually preferred the GH3 cover of this over the original at one point in time. Just a fun little ditty of a track that was so close to making day 2

---

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this is my true 11 but it doesnt feel very in theme for the rate

**mysario** (10): Pat Benetar can't miss (though you probably should miss and not hit her)

**Poydoo** (10): Icon behavior

**vapourlomo** (10): In This House We Respect Pat Benatar

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): classic

**Frajer** (9): I also have a long history of having my heart broken by cookies

**qazz23** (9): the main riff is simple yet catchy and the vocal melody is good; great solo and vocals too; 🔥 awayyyyyyy!

**vayyiqra** (9): It's a classic but synthpop suits her better than rock I think (""Love Is a Battlefield"" is a perfect song, this is merely a good one, whatever) 🎸

**a-man-with-a-perm** (8): Catch me on Bumble with the ‘Real Tough Cookie with a Long History’ bio (I will never get a match)

**bogo** (8): good

**disintegrationpoops** (8): I mean its a great song if a bit simple

**kvothetyrion** (8): I kinda forgot how much fun this song was. Also I complete forgot there was a solo here. And I forgot that the solo rocks.

**sarcasticsobs** (8): This isn't Pat's best shot, but still is good

**systemofstrings** (8): Guitar hero. (Not available)

**TheTyrannicalTyrant** (8): not bad

**welcome2thejam** (8): Solid track, I don't think I could ever really turn down hearing this song, it's an instant mood booster

**tonirali** (7.6): that solo comes outta nowhere, a tad excessive imo. can you imagine Elliot Easton ripping something way more tasteful here? that’d be so cool.

**freav** (7.5): go pat

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.5): Fire awaaaaaay!

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (7.5): Sorry Pat, but your music mostly makes me want to listen to Joan Jett

**Eldritch-field-ditch** (7): It's a fine song.

**freeofblasphemy** (7): Solid groover that makes me wish I was listening to the Pretenders

**iBark** (7): of barrell aged malört

**SlowDownGandhi** (7): i feel bad rating this this low, gals can rock too dammit

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): another song where overplay really killed my enjoyment of it. still remember how this was the first song i ever full combo'd on expert though!

**TheCrakFox** (7): Vocals have chutzpa, the riff gets a bit annoying though.

**a\_gallon\_of\_pcp** (6.7): fire away

**gimme\_toro** (6.5): nah but I’ll hit you with my best six(point 5)

**Nagisoid** (6): It's fine I guess, cool lyrics for its time but it gets annoying quickly with how short and repetitive it is.

**IAmHollar** (5): Whatever. This is fine.

**MCK\_ROHCK** (5): Sure, I guess

**pig-serpent** (5): 🦈🦈🦈

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): I've played Heartbreaker with friends on some GH game before and it bopped much harder than this, surprised that song isn't here instead

**Wane\_WiredX-Plorer\_Lietoc** (5): yeah sure

**TroyBerryCrunch** (3): Catchy and cute, but kinda lame

**chug-a-lug-judy-nails** (1): i regularly forget this song is in this game and that's because it's not particularly fun

**PaulaAbdulJabar** (1): rot",[],,0.0,jakethedog,False,False,"[{'a': ':jakethedog:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/azqejyjnmcc31_t5_2zj24/jakethedog'}, {'e': 'text', 't': ' '}]",True,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;#43: Pat Benetar - Hit Me With Your Best Shot&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another &amp;#39;let&amp;#39;s just jam opener&amp;#39; track to me. I actually preferred the GH3 cover of this over the original at one point in time. Just a fun little ditty of a track that was so close to making day 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CrimsonROSET&lt;/strong&gt; (10): this is my true 11 but it doesnt feel very in theme for the rate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mysario&lt;/strong&gt; (10): Pat Benetar can&amp;#39;t miss (though you probably should miss and not hit her)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poydoo&lt;/strong&gt; (10): Icon behavior&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;vapourlomo&lt;/strong&gt; (10): In This House We Respect Pat Benatar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ignitethephoenix&lt;/strong&gt; (9.5): classic&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frajer&lt;/strong&gt; (9): I also have a long history of having my heart broken by cookies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;qazz23&lt;/strong&gt; (9): the main riff is simple yet catchy and the vocal melody is good; great solo and vocals too; 🔥 awayyyyyyy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;vayyiqra&lt;/strong&gt; (9): It&amp;#39;s a classic but synthpop suits her better than rock I think (&amp;quot;Love Is a Battlefield&amp;quot; is a perfect song, this is merely a good one, whatever) 🎸&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a-man-with-a-perm&lt;/strong&gt; (8): Catch me on Bumble with the ‘Real Tough Cookie with a Long History’ bio (I will never get a match)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;bogo&lt;/strong&gt; (8): good&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;disintegrationpoops&lt;/strong&gt; (8): I mean its a great song if a bit simple&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kvothetyrion&lt;/strong&gt; (8): I kinda forgot how much fun this song was. Also I complete forgot there was a solo here. And I forgot that the solo rocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sarcasticsobs&lt;/strong&gt; (8): This isn&amp;#39;t Pat&amp;#39;s best shot, but still is good&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;systemofstrings&lt;/strong&gt; (8): Guitar hero. (Not available)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TheTyrannicalTyrant&lt;/strong&gt; (8): not bad&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;welcome2thejam&lt;/strong&gt; (8): Solid track, I don&amp;#39;t think I could ever really turn down hearing this song, it&amp;#39;s an instant mood booster&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tonirali&lt;/strong&gt; (7.6): that solo comes outta nowhere, a tad excessive imo. can you imagine Elliot Easton ripping something way more tasteful here? that’d be so cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;freav&lt;/strong&gt; (7.5): go pat&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LazyDayLullaby&lt;/strong&gt; (7.5): Fire awaaaaaay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;p-u-n-k_girl&lt;/strong&gt; (7.5): Sorry Pat, but your music mostly makes me want to listen to Joan Jett&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eldritch-field-ditch&lt;/strong&gt; (7): It&amp;#39;s a fine song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;freeofblasphemy&lt;/strong&gt; (7): Solid groover that makes me wish I was listening to the Pretenders&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iBark&lt;/strong&gt; (7): of barrell aged malört&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SlowDownGandhi&lt;/strong&gt; (7): i feel bad rating this this low, gals can rock too dammit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TakeOnMeByA-ha&lt;/strong&gt; (7): another song where overplay really killed my enjoyment of it. still remember how this was the first song i ever full combo&amp;#39;d on expert though!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TheCrakFox&lt;/strong&gt; (7): Vocals have chutzpa, the riff gets a bit annoying though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a_gallon_of_pcp&lt;/strong&gt; (6.7): fire away&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gimme_toro&lt;/strong&gt; (6.5): nah but I’ll hit you with my best six(point 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nagisoid&lt;/strong&gt; (6): It&amp;#39;s fine I guess, cool lyrics for its time but it gets annoying quickly with how short and repetitive it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IAmHollar&lt;/strong&gt; (5): Whatever. This is fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MCK_ROHCK&lt;/strong&gt; (5): Sure, I guess&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pig-serpent&lt;/strong&gt; (5): 🦈🦈🦈&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;thisusernameisntlong&lt;/strong&gt; (5): I&amp;#39;ve played Heartbreaker with friends on some GH game before and it bopped much harder than this, surprised that song isn&amp;#39;t here instead&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wane_WiredX-Plorer_Lietoc&lt;/strong&gt; (5): yeah sure&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TroyBerryCrunch&lt;/strong&gt; (3): Catchy and cute, but kinda lame&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chug-a-lug-judy-nails&lt;/strong&gt; (1): i regularly forget this song is in this game and that&amp;#39;s because it&amp;#39;s not particularly fun&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PaulaAbdulJabar&lt;/strong&gt; (1): rot&lt;/p&gt;

Hardwired: Fast, flashy, aggressive... A short and supercharged title track, somewhat similar to Lux Æterna in essence. 7/10.

Atlas, Rise!: A fine NWOBHM rip-off. I mean it's not even ""NWOBHM style"", it's straight up Iron Maiden and Diamond Head, especially that Hallowed Be Thy Name riff. Not bad tho, just totally unoriginal except the theme, 6.5/10.

Now That We're Dead: Another very fine track, more original and another unused theme again. I like it though, very enjoyable. 7/10.

Moth Into Flame: Ah yeah NOW we're talking. Absolutely gorgeous, simply beautiful. 7.5/10.

Dream No More: ***YOU TURN        TO STONE!***. Absolutely love these heavy-ass groovers. 7.5/10.

Halo On Fire: OK I know it gets a lot of love but I just don't see the appeal. For me it primarily marks the beginning of a very sad occurance in Metallica: bad execution of really good ideas. The intro is interesting, lyrics are downright bad and aren't necessarily about anything, most riffs aren't good enough either. The last 2 minutes *(""Hello darkness, say goodbye"")* part is amazing, but the lack of theme and overall the bad execution of good ideas (in my subjective opinion) make it a 6/10.

Confusion: WHAT A BOMBASTIC MAIN RIFF. Another Metallica war-themed song, better lyrics. However the good intro and the bombastic main riff are held back by a not-so-good execution again. 6/10. It's sad to see it twice in a row, but from here on it just gets worse.

ManUNkind: I don't want to say this but... Why did you put such a fine bass intro to such a dogshit song? By far the weakest link in the album, 3/10.

Here Comes Revenge: ""Ah yes revenge""-themed song, yet the ""revenge"" is taken very shallowly here. Some not-bad riff ideas, very poor execution, meh lyrics. 5/10

Am I Savage?: I don't remember the lyrics so won't comment on them. Musically yes *that* riff is nice and I know people love it but I just see the song as another extension of this recurring issue of ""not-that-bad ideas, poor execution"" on this album. 4/10.

Murder One: Unlike most people I actually find the progression better in this song. Lyrics are TERRIBLE. What the fuck is ""One man doesn't give a damn"", James? You probably didn't give a damn either while writing these lyrics too. Starts off as a classic Metallica ballad intro, also as far as I remember the solo was better on this one. Still, could be way way way better, also a bad tribute to Lemmy. 6/10.

Spit Out The Bone: 10/10. Very interesting theme, solid af lyrics, wonderful composition, aggression, speed, energy, best drumming of Lars since AJFA maybe, wonderful bass, extremely tight, more than enough variety for a 7 min track, good solos by Kirk AND Rob, beautifully arranged harmony section...

The opener did a seriously great job of getting everyone in the mood. I started it off with a great song that would set the tone for the rest of the night, then built the tension up with a series of groovers until it was time to just let loose. I kept the energy high and the dancefloor never stopped moving. Midway through the set, my gf distributed fresh fruit to everyone on the dancefloor and they loved it. In the latter half, I started mixing in some psytechno, which fit the mood perfectly.

Afterward, the feedback I got was amazing. I feel like it was probably my best set to date.

Je ne peux que te conseiller d'essayer Groover, le fonctionnement est le même que Submithub, avec un fort niveau d'exigence sur la sélection de playlists, mais avec des différences notables :

* Créé en France, donc beaucoup plus de contacts français et européens même si la communauté s'est beaucoup développée aussi aux USA, UK, Brésil, Italie, Mexique, Belgique, Allemagne, Canada etc.
* C'est moins ""saturé"" et compétitif que Submithub, donc tu as plus de chances que ta musique soit acceptée dans les playlists et d'obtenir des opportunités (jusqu'ici)

Buy as you go, tools can end up very project dependant anyhow, better to plan out what you're going to put together and buy the tools as needed. The only exception to this i'd say is embossing stamps, it's worth having a variety to experiment with.

I only bought the tools for setting rivets last week, had otherwise avoided them in favour of stitching until now, otherwise I'd used Chicago screws, only need a hole punch and screwdriver with the added benefit of being able to take them out and disassemble for maintenance or repairs. I've heard complaints of them coming undone but have never experienced it myself, snap studs are another alternative.
The kink folk I've done harnesses for loved the Chicago screws, meant they could add/subtract strapping and polish their brass back to shine.

Some tip punches are probably on your list if you want to do collars and cuffs, I'd also recommend oblong punches as opposed to circular for the tongue holes, puts less downward pressure on the leather in the buckle, stops the strap from warping or distorting as quickly.
If you plan on doing floggers, get a strap and lace cutter and keep an eye out for old leather motorcycle pants at your local thrift joints, the lace is also great for braiding the shaft of crops.
Between the paddles I wet molded and the ones I did dry, everyone seemed to like the wet molded more, especially the embossed ones.. if you know you know.

Stitching (and stitching well) gets quicker with practise and a stitching pony is a worthwhile investment, diamond hole punches make the work much neater and easier than awls or speed stitchers in my opinion, a groover will help you keep those lines nice and straight, get an edge beveler to take the edge off the strapping, and a slicker to smooth it out, doesn't cut into the skin as much, unless that's what you're looking to achieve.
You might find having a variety of needle sizes and quality threads on hand can make for a better stitching experience, have seen a lot of people give up on the saddle stitch because they only had 1 size needle that was too difficult to fit through their stitch holes at the same time, would've been a $5 fix to their frustration.
Stitching is one of those things you could right a whole book on adjacent to any of the other leather topics, the main hurdle to me for a nice consistent stitch is keeping an even pressure at each stitch, it becomes more obvious over time where you've pulled too hard or not enough when you're hand stitching. 

The most worthwhile tools early on I'd recommend are decent cutting and skiving tools, a Stanley knife will do you for a while, but soon enough you'll want to cut neater and more complex shapes and shave down edges nicely.

There are lots of punches with interchangeable tips that are pretty versatile and have lasted me as long as my dedicated tipped punches, just have somewhere to keep them all organised, I'd avoid rotary punches, takes me a lot longer and is too hard on the hands when you have 30 holes to punch per restraint.

So beautiful, great side hikes (hike at least half way up Honaker Trail!). It takes a team to make a great trip &amp; being helpful is the easiest way to get invited again. You are responsible for your safety, staying in the boat in rowdy water, not making dumb choices that end up in injury. 

What to expect: 
The launch - arrive at the boat ramp, drop boats in the water (or blow up &amp; assemble), be ready to help your boat captain by handing them the gear as they ask for it. Have all your stuff out of the truck and mostly packed away. You're group might be running their own shuttle, most people hire a shuttle company for the lower bc its a long round trip. Offer to pitch on gas money &amp; shuttle costs. Depending on their degree of rigging pre-done and the amount of gear, rigging could take an hour or 4. Ask for a pre-launch safety talk.

Using the bathroom: the San Juan is high use and gets little rain, always always always pee in the river! No one is peeping your junk, so just step upstream or down stream a bit for privacy. The Groover! This is where you poop. Its a box w/ a toilet lid. Do Not Pee In The Groover! Poo only! Get yourself prepped (push up your sleeves or remove your jacket, get your tp ready, then flip that lid gently and do no look! Set yourself up so your poop goes straight into the hole (not too far forward), do your business and then close the lid. If its looking full tell your TL (trip leader). Do not touch anything else until you wash your hands. 

The boat- your job as a passenger is to help the captain. Does she need a bevvy? Does she need a water top off? Stay out of the way of her oars and let her know if you're gonna move around the boat. Youre also in charge of helping land the boat, that means having the bow line ready to go and stepping off the boat when she is landing. This takes a little practice and do not try to get off the boat if you're not feeling confident about safely getting off. Most boat accidents happen getting on and off the boat. Don't step into water you can't see how deep it is bc the bank could be very steep. In rapids it is especially important to be clear of her oars, perhaps a helmet for Government Rapid. Hold on to a strap/chicken line &amp; it helps to kinda go into an athletic position in bigger waves (soft knees). Ask your captain about high siding &amp; plans if you pin or flip. If you're concerned about being cold on the boat (its usually a few degrees cooler on the water) i go w/ leggings under rain pants, a long sleeve &amp; a handy rain jacket. I wouldn't recommend boots on the boat in case you go in (they'll sink &amp; could sink you). Ask your captain their boat rules, some people are picky about sand/mud, some people want you to crush your cans, some people don't. As a passenger, you may be blocking your captains view so if you see a hazard (rocks/sleepers) ask your captain if they see it.

Camp: in my group (as in many) getting to camp involves landing and tying up the boats, then unloading the gear. You carry gear until no one needs help. Setting up the kitchen and groover first, your personal camp after. In the morning, as you pack up, think about what you'll need on the boat handy bc if its packed in your dry bag, you might not have access to it while on the river. The trash, water jugs and hand wash station are often the last group gear packed onto boats in the morning. You should set up &amp; break down the groover at least once, its a dirty job but if you have an aversion people will notice. Ask someone to show you how to do both. Wash your hands after dealing w/ the groover in any capacity. I like to do a ""day plan"" talk before launch every morning before launch, where are we planning on hikes, lunches, and the next camp, what rapids should we expect.

Take Out: saddest part of the trip! Land boats &amp; start removing the extra gear (ask your captain their plan). If you're unloading a lot of gear stack gear up and off to the side grouped into which truck they'll be packed into. Be ready to lift &amp; move boats. 

Gear: tent (i like for bugs), sleeping bag, sleeping pad, use a stuff sack for your clothes and that can be your pillow, camp chair, dry bags, pelican case or other dry case for the boat, sunglasses, sunscreen, bugs pray, salve/lotion, chapstick, toiletries, advil, ear plugs (for nearby sleepers who snore), Claritin, camera, layers to add/shed, rain gear (nice for rapids too!), beanie, puffy, shorts, pants, sun hat, warm gloves, spf sunshirt, sarong (for keeping sun off your shoulders or legs on boat/camp, bonus tip, dip it in the water to cool off), headlamp, pfd, ask about dishes/mugs, some people have plates/bowls/utensils for the group standard in their kitchen box, some groups are BYO, water bottle w/ locking caribeaner (NO non locking caribeaners), beer (if you drink, you might find yourself drinking more than usual, lunch beers are not uncommon), Whiskey for camp, dry snacks, rubber boots can be nice, shoes you don't mind getting wet, sandals. For myself, I can usually roll w/ a large dry bag (the Colorado or Mississippi model watershed is great) and a pelican case to fit everything. You will inevitably forget something or find you will definitely want something you didn't pack for your next trip. 

Remember to drink water and think about your sun exposure! Knives are sharp, fire is hot, rattlesnakes exist. Be careful and aware. If you're not feeling well, tell someone bc a well informed group works better.

Have fun, take lots of pictures and let us know how it goes!",[],,0.0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;OP! So fun! 5 days sounds like the Lower through The Goosenecks! So beautiful, great side hikes (hike at least half way up Honaker Trail!). It takes a team to make a great trip &amp;amp; being helpful is the easiest way to get invited again. You are responsible for your safety, staying in the boat in rowdy water, not making dumb choices that end up in injury. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What to expect: 
The launch - arrive at the boat ramp, drop boats in the water (or blow up &amp;amp; assemble), be ready to help your boat captain by handing them the gear as they ask for it. Have all your stuff out of the truck and mostly packed away. You&amp;#39;re group might be running their own shuttle, most people hire a shuttle company for the lower bc its a long round trip. Offer to pitch on gas money &amp;amp; shuttle costs. Depending on their degree of rigging pre-done and the amount of gear, rigging could take an hour or 4. Ask for a pre-launch safety talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the bathroom: the San Juan is high use and gets little rain, always always always pee in the river! No one is peeping your junk, so just step upstream or down stream a bit for privacy. The Groover! This is where you poop. Its a box w/ a toilet lid. Do Not Pee In The Groover! Poo only! Get yourself prepped (push up your sleeves or remove your jacket, get your tp ready, then flip that lid gently and do no look! Set yourself up so your poop goes straight into the hole (not too far forward), do your business and then close the lid. If its looking full tell your TL (trip leader). Do not touch anything else until you wash your hands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boat- your job as a passenger is to help the captain. Does she need a bevvy? Does she need a water top off? Stay out of the way of her oars and let her know if you&amp;#39;re gonna move around the boat. Youre also in charge of helping land the boat, that means having the bow line ready to go and stepping off the boat when she is landing. This takes a little practice and do not try to get off the boat if you&amp;#39;re not feeling confident about safely getting off. Most boat accidents happen getting on and off the boat. Don&amp;#39;t step into water you can&amp;#39;t see how deep it is bc the bank could be very steep. In rapids it is especially important to be clear of her oars, perhaps a helmet for Government Rapid. Hold on to a strap/chicken line &amp;amp; it helps to kinda go into an athletic position in bigger waves (soft knees). Ask your captain about high siding &amp;amp; plans if you pin or flip. If you&amp;#39;re concerned about being cold on the boat (its usually a few degrees cooler on the water) i go w/ leggings under rain pants, a long sleeve &amp;amp; a handy rain jacket. I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend boots on the boat in case you go in (they&amp;#39;ll sink &amp;amp; could sink you). Ask your captain their boat rules, some people are picky about sand/mud, some people want you to crush your cans, some people don&amp;#39;t. As a passenger, you may be blocking your captains view so if you see a hazard (rocks/sleepers) ask your captain if they see it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Camp: in my group (as in many) getting to camp involves landing and tying up the boats, then unloading the gear. You carry gear until no one needs help. Setting up the kitchen and groover first, your personal camp after. In the morning, as you pack up, think about what you&amp;#39;ll need on the boat handy bc if its packed in your dry bag, you might not have access to it while on the river. The trash, water jugs and hand wash station are often the last group gear packed onto boats in the morning. You should set up &amp;amp; break down the groover at least once, its a dirty job but if you have an aversion people will notice. Ask someone to show you how to do both. Wash your hands after dealing w/ the groover in any capacity. I like to do a &amp;quot;day plan&amp;quot; talk before launch every morning before launch, where are we planning on hikes, lunches, and the next camp, what rapids should we expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Out: saddest part of the trip! Land boats &amp;amp; start removing the extra gear (ask your captain their plan). If you&amp;#39;re unloading a lot of gear stack gear up and off to the side grouped into which truck they&amp;#39;ll be packed into. Be ready to lift &amp;amp; move boats. &lt;/p&gt;

The 'cheapness' of an inexpensive Amazon kit was the factor that got me started, so even if everything in the kit was low quality, *it got me rolling in the hobby* when otherwise I might never have started / tried.   

IIRC, the only thing that was really ""unusable"" from the kit was the x-acto style knife which did not hold the blade securely. And of all the needles, there was literally only 1 or 2 that were actually useful for 'normal' small goods projects.  But even now I still regularly use:

* The 2mm and 3mm hole punches
* The diamond chisels
* The burnishing tool
* The nippers
* The edge groover
* All the thread
* The awl (occasionally)  

Some things I added immediately:  

* Corked backed ruler (the included one did not have a cork back)
* Better razor / x-acto knife
* Self-healing cutting mat
* Nylon maul / hammer

So, the kit didn't have it all and I only used 1/3 to 1/2 of what the kit included, *but* the kit was ""only"" $20-25 and buying just the tools I used piecemeal would have cost more and taken more time, plus I wasn't totally sure what was needed and what wasn't.

(edit) for reference, [this is the kit from Amazon](https://a.co/d/fLJFOTS) that I started with.

I recommend fixing on 1 or 2 specific projects that you want to start with, do some research (here, vidoes, etc.) and make a list of exactly what tools and materials you will need, then find a kit that matches that list as closely as possible without a lot of extras.   For example, I was tempted to buy a bigger kit with some stamps 'cause ""more is better, right?"" but I didn't have any ideas for using them and it turns out even more than a year later, I still haven't come across anything that I actually need / want a stamp for (yet).

In lieu, use a ""quality"" scratch compass and forget the groover unless you see need to protect the stitches. This won't Mar your leather too badly and it will keep your stitch line straight. 

Be sure to burnish your pocket tops! Those small hairs sticking up make it a pita to get your cards out without making more hair.

To kick it: find a winter hobby early and stick to it (skiing is expensive, but if you like it, its a lifesaver and worth it! sledding is much cheaper and so fun). Tricking yourself into enjoying the cold is a must because its 7 months out of the year. Also finding warm winter clothes that you actually like will be immensely helpful - try Sierra for something cheap, colorful, and warm. Something that may be helpful: add a tab for both places to your weather app every day and check on them at least weekly so you get a feel for what it'll be like ahead of time!
2. Do some research on the culture for each spot, like you're doing now! Everyone is going to be white in either spot so just be ready for that and the culture that comes with it. I cant speak to Madison, but if you're coming to SLC, get ready for white people (were talking 90% white-and-only-white here), skiing, brunch, skiing, everyone being outside and very very nice during the beautiful (but short) summers, very cool trees, people not saying what they mean, skiing, an eerily strong Mormon presence, an even stronger Mormon counter-culture presence, skiing, super tight and weird alcohol laws (but there's no bar scene here anyway), skiing. People here do not dance, so be aware of that if you're an avid groover and like live music (on the flip side this is good if you dont like dancing bc no one will expect or try to get you to). Fry sauce. Its ketchup and mayonnaise and its *the* delicacy. Runner up for food is excessive amounts of sugar (for some reason the mormon alternative to alcohol is cookies and soda ??). They put mayonnaise in the sushi at Harmon's.
3. Start talking to some of the people in your admitted cohorts and see who you vibe with better! You'll be with these people for a while and it can totally change your experience. Along with friends you make in the area, *they can make all the struggles seem easy to tackle or they can make every little inconvenience make you feel miserable*.
4. Research the cost of living and rent prices! Just go on zillow and see what you can get in either place with your monthly stipend. Be warned the cost of living in Utah is bad right now. People are moving here for some reason so the housing market is wild. Even with a 30k stipend, exactly half of my salary goes to rent and utilities (thats staying in a small house 25 mins away from campus split between 3 roommates).",[],,0.0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who came to the U after growing up in a warm/humid/more-demographically-diverse area, here&amp;#39;s some things I wish I would have known before coming here:&lt;/p&gt;

The vocals in **Remedy** are beautiful, wow. **Loose Lips** is catchy.

**Sunrise Song** is just that, you can just picture yourself listening to this gorgeous music watching the sunrise. Perfection.

**Free** is great, it's good to see Because of Art on Anjunadeep, I hope they continue with him, I think he could bring some good stuff to the label. 

**Lullaby of the Seraphim** has that Sebastian Sellares signature sound.

**Lady Danger** is the standout track of CD1 for me, it's such a banger. Simon Doty can't do any wrong in my eyes at the moment, and he's put out another winner with this one.

Behind Lady Danger, **Shadows Falling** by John Monkman is my next standout track. Love this sort of sound and John has done great here. Excited to hear more from him in the future hopefully.

The mix ends with a very melancholy **Second Chance** and **one last thing you never said**.

The whole of CD1 flows very well. I love the chilled vibe to it (makes sense seeing as Reflections has been featured a bit on this compilation) and how it slowly builds.

CD2 starts with such gorgeous piano of **Solace** from Croquet Club. I'm not usually a fan of Croquet Club but this is so refreshing.

**Falling** then takes it up a notch and gets more upbeat. Other mentions are **Blue Nights**, **When I'm With You** and **Leonid**. Durante has really done well on this compilation.

**Surge** remix is such a groover, as you'd expect from PROFF, I've been waiting for this one ever since I first heard it on James &amp; Jody's set from Anjunadeep Explorations. 

**Another Local** brings back that signature 16BL sound. **The Truth** is a great pairing with Braxton &amp; Warung. 

Antrim's remix of **Silhoutte** is absolutely fantastic. The original was spectacular work from Yotto but Antrim has done an amazing job on the remix.

My Friend are on fire - James &amp; Archie are one my favorites on Anjunadeep. **Follow Me** is massive and absolutely goes off when played in the clubs. And then they team up with Dosem for **Door To Door** for another dark dance floor destroyer. 

Both are very very good mixes, but CD2 is the better CD out of the two for me because I prefer the club side of the Anjunadeep sound. 

Having said that, overall, it's another solid compilation and yet another fantastic outing from James &amp; Jody. They really are great DJs, their mixes are always curated and mixed impeccably.

I got a cheap groover from Amazon but I can't figure out how to actually get it to cut the leather after the first couple uses. Assuming it needs to be sharpened somehow? Anyway, basically I just took a ruler and rubbed another ruler held vertically to make an indent. Definitely sounds like it would be more straightforward than it turned out. I seem to especially screw up the first couple stitches. Any tips on that? Also, even when the groover did cut the leather, I had trouble getting a straight line. I imagine I just gotta practice a bunch but I'd be happy to hear about any protocols I am not familiar with!

Also, about making the little edge crease at the top of the pockets.. I took the edge beveler, turned it upside down, and just ran it up and down to get a crease. Then I took the ecoflo antique gel and used a cotton swab to kinda put some into that dent. Happy with the dent but the color didn't end up consistent.

**Disc 1** — IMO, one of the best opening discs we’ve had in years. The mix itself is flawless, perfect end to end listening. So many stand out tunes, but my personal highlights below.

* Durante - Remedy — set the vibe nice and early, what a groove… gave me those ‘Say Hello’ vibes from volume 12
* Enamour - Brush The Dust Off Your Soul — he always delivers on these comps! Ethereal track
* Loose Lips (J&amp;J Remix) — an absolute gorgeous remix from the lads, one of the top tracks 
* J&amp;J Free — my favourite from their 500 Open Air Set, glad to get this at last! 
* J&amp;J &amp; Legato - Petals — proper Marsh type groove on this… but damn does this take a unique turn from the breakdown to the final drop! Serious vibes 
* Simon Doty - Lady Danger — no words, classic Doty with that signature chunky groove. Proper house belter 
* Blake.08 - Eyes Ablaze — not usually a fan of breakbeats, but this is the best I’ve heard. This guys making a real impression on me after his recent EP... would love to hear a house version 

**Disc 2** — After listening, get the feeling James played more of a role in disc 1 whilst Jody took the helm here… felt the flow of the mix was disrupted too many times and not cohesive. Still a few cracker tunes, but definitely not my favourite disc in recent times. 

* Simon Doty - Sloane + Sibs — wow, an absolute highlight here. This is Doty at his best, that piano breakdown was hypnotising 
* Duke Boara - Woodwick Close — this one got me moving, proper groover from the get go. Such a fun track and wish it played out for longer 
* Joseph Ray - Blue Nights — felt like I may have heard this before (Open Air set?), but lovely tune 
* Durante - Leonid — Another melodic gem from Durante, guy can’t miss.",[],,0.0,22,False,False,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'SIRENS OF THE SEA'}]",False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;got a full listen in last night, my thoughts below &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can submit your music to the curators of your choice for small amounts of money by contact and get guaranteed they listen to your music and give you feedback or you get credits back. A majority of the playlist curators, bloggers, record labels, channels are right now based in France, Canada, Brazil, the UK, the US, Italy, Belgium, Australia etc. with a country by country approach.

&lt;p&gt;Good luck for everything!&lt;/p&gt;

We've been working hard and improving our vetting and evaluation system for playlist curators this past semester, we still have a lot to do but we're on our way to refine a much better system. Regarding the Top Curators who added you to small playlists, would you mind disclosing through email some examples (or more) at [support@groover.co](mailto:support@groover.co) ? It would actually be super helpful to us in order to moderate the community of curators better.

If you're aiming at high impact curators only, I'd suggest using the filters this way:

* Filter by Type &gt; Playlist Curator
* Tick the badges ""Certifie Spotify Playlist"" and ""Top Curator""
* Of course tick the 1-2-3 (max) subgenres corresponding to your track (if you want our take on which genre you should select for your track to get in touch with the most relevant curators, feel free to ask on our internal chat)

You might be doing all of this already, but just in case :) We're working on improving the information available on curators and the evaluation of their impact. We're also asking them to only share in their bigger playlists and we're setting up a system to control this.

Once again, I'm 100% conscious we have a long way to go, this is THE big challenge we have to tackle, on top of helping artists choose the right contacts for their music. But we're definitely committed to getting better and better. The metrics we're seeing in terms of satisfaction and impact tend to show it's going in the right direction :)

I'm at your disposal if you need anything, feel free to reach out!

You would need a strip of leather (you might be able to find a remnants bag with one the right size - they're less than $10 at Tandy, iirc), a finish/sealant, waxed thread, needles and a punch. You could optionally include leather dye or paint, letter stamps, and a saddle groover.

With the exception of tools, the most expensive things are the dye and finish. The good news is most of the tools can be improvised:

A saddle groover gives you a beautiful line for the stitching to follow and sit in, but it's not necessary. You can mark the line with a straight edge and pencil.

An old fork can be used to mark your hole spacing.

You don't need an expensive punch, either. You can use a cheap awl (like $8 from Canadian Tire).

I've heard of people using Sharpies to colour leather, but I've never tried it myself. This might be a feasible option if you want to leave the leather with a natural (non-dyed) appearance and save some money on stamps/paint.",,,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_127zgji,,,False,/r/Edmonton/comments/127zgji/is_there_somewhere_locally_i_can_get_custom/jegurpz/,public,False,t1_jegurpz,,,[],1680302241.0,r/Edmonton,0,,,,,,,groover,,,,,,,1611995327.0,1681161900.0

I’ve run numerous campaigns with them. Last campaign was about $500 and resulted in less than 2,000 plays. This campaign was about $500 (maybe $400 with some of the discounts?) and…the results are terrible. The song was accepted on many playlists. I think it’s in the ballpark of 80-100 playlists. The vast majority of these playlists aren’t fake or real—they’re simply “dead.” I noticed curators on Groover (and SubmitHub) will join the site by submitting a major playlist (say, 10-20k followers). Then they’ll create smaller playlists with a few hundred dead followers (likely other artists who already submitted songs and were instructed to “follow playlist and stream it”). This is how you end up with an ecosystem that’s so ubiquitous now: tons and tons of playlist “curators” accepting songs that get nearly zero streams. This has happened to me *repeatedly*. Even when you get a “top curator” to accept your track, it rarely ends up on their “top playlist.” As I’ve said before, it’ll likely end up on their dead playlist. I say “dead” and not “fake” even though, at this point, it’s best to just call this scheme what it is: deceptive. And since it’s deceptive, it’s also fraudulent. Hence “fake” may be the appropriate term here. (“Fake” because you are led to believe a top curator with 10-20k follower Spotify playlist accepted your song when in reality that’s not what happened, and that’s far from what’s actually going on at Groover and SubmitHub.) 

I’ve run numerous campaigns on SubmitHub and can attest to it having a much lower acceptance rate than Groover with equally bad (if not worse) results. I don’t even know if I’ve managed to get a 1000 streams using SubmitHub from 20-30 playlist placements—it’s truly that atrocious. 

My music is also professionally produced, mixed, and mastered. (Our two studios have north of $300,000 of equipment between them—with all the standard stuff like 251s, 47s, 67s, hand-built 0.8 micron ribbon mics [$8k a piece], 1073s, 1176s, etc., etc. You get the point.) There’s nothing a major studio has that we don’t. Other than a Steinway piano, maybe.

Having said all that, I’ve run over $10k worth of PlaylistPush campaigns and can say that while the rejection rate is high on there (most will reject your song), if you get on any of their playlists, they’re the real deal. Your song will get tens of thousands of real streams and organic growth. That’s the positive answer to the eternal question all of us musicians ask ourselves: what to do? 

Having said *that*, I will also point out that even PlaylistPush had a playlist or two that used bots. (Which I obviously reported.) Bots are, more or less, everywhere.

Rim Kwaku Obeng was a member of the Ghanian highlife act Uhuru Dance Band (other members throughout the band’s history include Joe Mensah and Ebo Taylor). Uhuru Dance Band travelled to Los Angeles to record an album but, due to a disagreement within the band, Obeng was ousted from Uhuru and stranded in America. *Rim Arrives* was recorded with session musicians in San Francisco which gives the album a very interesting sound: West African highlife percussion with a very American sounding post-disco backing band. It sounds a bit like a middle point between King Sunny Adé’s early 80s albums and West Coast funk of the era. This was the only album Rim Kwaku Obeng released during the 80s and the reissue on BBE tacks on a single from the era called “International Funk”. This album is a little thin in parts but has some memorable groovers.

**Dream Dolphin** *Selected Ambient &amp; Downtempo Works (1996-2003)* (2023): I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw this listed as a new release earlier this month. *Selected Ambient &amp; Downtempo Works* is a compilation of music from the little known Japanese producer Dream Dolphin, organized by the Music From Memory label. I had written about Dream Dolphin’s 1997 album *The Seventh Dream* on LTM in 2021. At the time, there was almost no information about the album and scant information about the artist. Two years later, with the release of this collection, Dream Dolphin is still a mystery. Dream Dolphin is credited as simply Noriko and the press release for this album has just a few bits of biographical information that were already out there: she began recording music in her teens and has released twenty albums. As the title indicates, this compilation focuses on her quieter work. It keeps a consistent vibe but a piece of me would have liked a collection that presents the totality of Dream Dolphin’s work. *The Seventh Dream*, for example, veers from J-pop to gabber to trip-hop and back. 1996’s *Atmospheric Healing* is a much better representation of her ambient production work. I am sure that it is daunting to boil twenty albums worth of music down to one collection. It’s wonderful that this music is available to a much wider audience and I don’t blame the label for releasing music that is currently in vogue, but it feels like this compilation plays it a little too safe when the artist’s music is much more bold than what is presented here.

**Fever Ray** *Radical Romantics* (2023): Fever Ray has never sounded as good as they do on this album. The alternate universe in which their Fever Ray persona reigns has never sounded so painterly and fleshed out. There was definitely a sense of Fever Ray’s sonic landscape on their 2009 self-titled album, and though I wasn’t a fan of 2017’s *Plunge*, there was an expansion of that landscape. With this album, it’s a place you can almost touch. Looking past the elegant, idiosyncratic sound design and the post-production effects that they use on their voice, the thing that stands out immediately to me is how excellent and concise the songwriting is. There are plenty of earworm hooks throughout this album and the verses are overflowing with visual imagery. Dreijer has the ability to observe microscopic details and make romantic epics out of them as they do on “Tapping Fingers”. Even if you copied their vocal effects (which, good luck, it’ll never sound as good), you would be hard pressed to write a song as well as they do on this album.

“Shiver” may be the best and most forwardly pop-oriented song in the Fever Ray catalog. It seems so simple but the combination of a fragmentary chorus and more wordy verses with multitracked vocal effects fluttering around the edges makes for an outstanding listening experience. You may not even notice that the kick drum never comes in. “Kandy” was released ahead of the album and its vocal formant shift down into a low register makes it one of the album’s most lecherous and unwholesome moments. “Looking For A Ghost” has a rolling polyrhythm courtesy of Portuguese producer NÍDIA that holds down the song for some of the album’s most expressive, strange, and memorable vocals. “Even It Out” has gotten attention in the press, for obvious reasons, though I think the other Trent Reznor co-produced song, “North”, is one of the album’s best moments - a low-key stunner of a ballad that calls back to Fever Ray’s earliest work.

*Radical Romantics* is one of the year’s best albums so far by any metric. Can we talk about how Karin Dreijer, at 47 years old, has released some of their best work to date in a career that is full of highlights?

I think you're the same person who gave that review on Trustpilot so I'll also share my thoughts here, thank you for your honest feedback :)

Your intuition about the number of curators is more than valid, it's actually verified on our end. We've run multiple studies on the artist's satisfaction depending on how many curators they have selected and the results show the satisfaction skyrockets when you've got in touch with over 30 and even 50 curators. It's really hard to get relevant results with 5 to 10 curators, some of them won't answer, some of them will say it's not your editorial line and it's hard to get the value out of your experience. While when you send to 50 curators, you'll get close to 45 pieces of feedback straight away (and credits back to submit to 5 more), and we got an average 20 to 25% acceptance rate on Groover, which means you should be getting around 10 approvals or more if you've targeted well. I can only advise you to try out a ""bigger"" campaign, especially since you got quite good feedback already.

Here's more information about this: https://help.groover.co/fr/articles/4699856-what-budget-should-i-invest-on-my-groover-campaign  
Regarding CatchyTwentyTwo, I'm sorry for this experience, some curators are more precise in their feedback than others, we monitor this as much as we can and it's quite successful, but there are always some replies that can be a bit more disappointing than others. Music genres are super subjective, so in some occasions a curator can like indie rock but consider that a specific indie rock track is not in their editorial line, that's both kind of understandable/totally normal AND frustrating for the artist submitting of course. We don't have an absolute solution for this apart from warning the curator to regularly update their profile and only keep the genres they absolutely love.

Whether it would be worth the money is another question altogether.

I did have one bad experience where I pitched to a curator called CatchyTwentyTwo who liked my track but said they didn’t do alt rock playlists, despite clearly stating that they want alt rock (among other genres) in their bio. I’ve been given a promo code to somewhat compensate me for that, so props to Groover there. Groover have also said they will speak to this particular curator so they’re trying to maintain some quality control at least.

The best thing to do is get on some playlists. How to get on playlists is a complicated and time-consuming operation, there’s a lot of scams out there, and any pay for play is very likely not gonna break even, and worse, may result in Spotify demonetizing your music if they think you’re spamming or paid for fake streams. 

That said, it’s probably worth it to throw $100 each at SubmitHub and Groover. Those are vetted, legitimate and active curators and influencers who can get you internet presence, natural buzz, plays from actual playlists, and possibly more followers. You pay $1-2 for them to listen to your song and write you feedback. If they don’t listen or write back, they don’t get paid and you get your money back. 

These submissions also take time and you need to be authentic and write your pitches well and matching according to what they say they’re looking for. I did it and got on a ton of playlists and got some really great Instagram, Facebook, internet radio, local radio and blog shares. Now while I haven’t seen the return for my money in terms of short term streams, maybe long term it will even out, especially since I don’t have much data on the other platforms and some people don’t use Spotify. I figure at the least, it will feed Spotify some data that long term will tell the algorithm how my music connects with a particular listener and I’ll start to get some natural recommendations. 

I also got on some real playlists for free but it takes a lot more time. You have to search playlists and find their contact somehow (sometimes you gotta be super creative to track them down) and after you write a really sincere letter pitching your song and justifying why it matches their playlist, 80% will ignore you completely, 9% will deny you, and 9% will hit you up for money in exchange for playlist placement.

For reference, 65,000 songs a day are uploaded to Spotify, you have to do something to market your music.

ONE to DREAM! : I like! I think this has the potential to become my favorite FRAME song, but I gotta see if that energy keeps me pumped through the full version. ;)

Atmosphere : Call me a sucker for ballads sung by pretty voices, but this is definitely Hideo's better solo and wow am I looking forward to the full on this one. Tender boy...

SPARKLE SIGN : And ditto here! Happy Go Unlucky is a cute and fun song, no doubt, but I feel like this one is really showing a more developed Ryu, not to mention showing off how much his VA has grown in singing talent!

Tick Tack Voice : This FRAME release is really favoring these tender tunes for our boys, isn't it? This has Soothing Place energy, and that's never a bad thing. Looking forward to the full on this, and all of these for that matter!

Tricolor Rendezvous : Okay so this is *definitely* my favorite F-LAGS song as of this moment. F-LAGS is this weird case for me where I like each of its characters as individuals, but always kinda felt like the Unit lacked some general cohesion and the music has always been mostly middle of the road for me, with a few standing out more than others. This unintentional drag fest has a point though! It's that this song REALLY grabbed me, moreso than any of F-LAGS previous stuff has, and I am very for it! 49 Ele doesn't miss.

Yell Song : I think that this song does a much better job of showing off what Sanpei is capable of than the previous solo did, and it's not close. But with that said, I think I like the song itself less than Habataki no My Soul, so this one winds up as an unfortunate middle road song.

SASH OF SMILE : Love it, just immediately love it. Perfect sort of song for Daigo and that cute lil voice of his, and it's such an upbeat high-tempo groover! No notes, keep being awesome Daigo.

Hisseki no Kanata : This is such a solid improvement over Kazuki's last solo. While I feel like the previous solo did a good job of capturing Kazuki's whole vibe, I also feel like it was just kind of boring to listen to? This one though is more calming and pretty, so it does a better job of being a good song while still maintaining Kazuki's character in it.

I couldn't agree more with you OP but I will say this... Take it as you will.. buy the ticket, take the ride.*

The **ideology** of raving, clubbing, partying has changed entirely. It started as an outlet for fringe **outsiders** to express their creativity and collectively be part of a subculture that was (generally) accepting to all. It was place where we could be socially connected under a common banner of being ***ravers.*** In this, we experienced and were part of a cultural movement. A **cultural scene** in which we all contributed to the greater whole. It didn't matter if you were hardcore kandy-raver or part of the breakbeat-junglist massive. Whether you were a techno-trance shaman or house-head groover, you had a place in this scene. You were contributing to the landscape of the scene. **You were part of it but not it in its entirety.**

The shift happened when it became less about the **scene** itself and more about being **seen** individually. I primarily blame **social media** for this. Social media, by-and-large, is very **narcissistic** in nature.

Groover allows you to guarantee that the contacts you have chosen - either media outlets, playlist curators, record labels etc. - will listen to your track, and those contacts can give impact to your release if they decide to share it, which they are free to do or not. If you had contacted them by email, they wouldn't have opened it and clicked on the link in close to 100% of cases. If you have already tried reaching out to blogs/playlists by email, you know what I'm saying.
* Most artists understand this value, some even asked us if we could remove feedback since they didn't want to receive some and just wanted to be sure their music was listened to and considered for sharing. We didn't allow for this option since we realized through tests that curators were 4 times more likely to reject the track when they weren't required to write feedback
* We verify listening through our system. Feedback can sometimes be generic but we track this and limit it as much as possible. This is mostly the case for radio stations as radio hosts tend to feel not at ease with ""judging"" a track, just wanting to say if they want to add it in rotation or not. On the other hand, radio stations are what a lot of artists are willing to get in touch with, and they have very decent acceptance rates. Hence the value balance :) If getting accepted by a radio station is worth getting rejected by another one with feedback that it's not that valuable, it's still a positive balance. The value of a Groover campaign lies more in its results as a whole than in evaluating each and every reply.
* To be clear, we're heavily monitoring copy-paste and generic feedback, plus requiring from curators to be more detailed. What I'm saying is that there are two sides to every situation. Removing from the platform a curator who accepts 30% of the submissions received and can have a nice impact for this track, but on the other hand can't write very detailed feedback, means removing a cool opportunity for artists. That's why we resorted to adding a warning message on those profiles, so artists don't expect too much from the feedback they might receive if they want to try their luck with a curator who might share their music and have a great visibility impact for them.",,,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_1195j9a,,,False,/r/musicproduction/comments/1195j9a/do_services_like_submithub_or_groover_actually/j9owljx/,public,False,t1_j9owljx,,,[],1677165063.0,r/musicproduction,0,,,,,,,groover,,,,,,,1474447131.0,1678163653.0

* stories published up to 2014 (up to ""A Trade in Faces"" or possibly ""The Gift""/""Blemmigan Affair"") which are structurally quite simple, often tracked via a single quality
* starting with ""The Gift""/""Blemmigan Affair"" (2014 Christmas story and 2015's Feast story, respectively) or maybe ""Marsh House"" (the first execptional story) Failbetter added various features to StoryNexus and stories got longer and more complex. (""Gift"" and ""Blemmigan"" feature a randomised section, ""Marsh House"" introduces time tracking and things developing over multiple in-game days)
* the next change is a lot more subtle and it's hard to pinpoint when to start, but 2018-ish stories got yet longer and more complex, mid-decisions started to matter more (""Murgatroyd Formula"" or ""For All the Saints"" are good examples of that) such that you wouldn't see larger parts of the text or text paragraphs got adjusted based on your decisions.

If you started playing within that last period, I can definitely see that you may find older stories short and somewhat simplistic. In addition, you're very spoiled by lore being much more accessible than it used to be. ""Lost in Reflections"" or ""Calendar Council"" were *HUGE* reveals back at the time. I replayed ""Waltz"" not to long ago and still liked it a lot. But I'm a also a huge fan of Alexis Kennedy's and in particular Cash DeCuir's writing style, so that may play into it.

Fine Dining’s mechanics do run anathema to the majority of FL, but I’ve personally enjoyed — or at least respected — any ES that experiments with the game’s tone and format (like Groover’s Paisley). 

In FL, failure is punished: you’ll lose actions and resources until you succeed, with the plot usually screeching to a halt until you do. Meanwhile, Fine Dining makes you *deal* with failure as your plans crumble into abject chaos. If the tone were anything but comedic it’d fall flat on its face, but it’s trying to show you how entertaining failure can be. I think it speaks to author Jack de Quidt’s involvement in tabletop RPGs, where a bad roll always moves the plot along and adds interesting new wrinkles to the story. I think knowing that background going into it helped me meet it on those terms.

Maybe it’d sting less for people if the telegraphing was clearer — “this is not a game to win, but a madhouse to survive: cheer on your successes and laugh at your failures.” I never read other people’s echoes or paid to re-do it; simply getting to experience a night gone horribly wrong was enough.",,,,Harpoon,False,False,"[{'a': ':MonsterHunter:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/sbc60uy77hc31_t5_2uexp/MonsterHunter'}]",False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_1125b7g,,dark,False,/r/fallenlondon/comments/1125b7g/results_of_our_fatelocked_stories_survey_january/j8j8c0x/,public,False,t1_j8j8c0x,,:MonsterHunter:,[],1676399803.0,r/fallenlondon,0,,,,,,,groover,,,,,,,1548173255.0,1678213163.0

I am a teacher and work full time. I also produce music on the side and am working on an album. I do Pop/R&amp;B music similar to Justin Bieber, Chris Brown and Usher. When I first started I struggled with promoting myself but now I feel like I have it on lock. Here's what I did:

1. I upload my song to DistroKid at least 5 weeks before release. I do this because I think it's important to pitch to Spotify. I know the odds aren't good for an underground artist, but 1 editorial will change your entire music career. Then I go to Fiverr and pay someone to write a Spotify Pitch. Then I pitch my song to Spotify. 
2. While I'm waiting for release, I used to create like 10-15 lip syncing videos for the best 15 seconds of my song and post them on Insta Reels, TikTok and YouTube Shorts, 1 video every 3 days or so. 
3. 3 days before release, I go to Groover and pitch my song to playlisters using the same Spotify Pitch I used to pitch to Spotify. Initially I just used the recommended pitches generated by Groover. **DON'T DO THIS**. Organize your playlisters by ""top rated curators."" Actually click on their profile and see how many Spotify followers they have. For me, if they had over 5k I moved forward to step 2 which is: After that, actually click on their Spotify and see what playlists they have. Make sure they have a lot of like (for me it's like 5k or more as well) and make sure that your song fits the theme of that playlist. If all this checks out, then add it to your campaign, and then **BOOKMARK IT** into a custom list. Over a few releases, you will have a nice list that you can just click and submit instantly. But this process may take hours, but the frontload will be worth it with each subsequent release. My 5th release got over 10k streams just from Groover.
4. Subscribe to Playlist Supply and start looking for playlists using their search feature. Playlists that are reachable will have contact info in the description of their playlist. Reach out to them via Instagram asking for playlisting. Do your research on playlists to make sure they aren't botted. Use a YouTube Video for that, it would take too long for me to explain. Once you have a list of playlists you can directly pitch to, you can unsubscribe to Playlist Supply and now you have guaranteed streams from Groover and a list of good playlists you can pitch to. 
5. Use Facebook Ads. I use Toneden because they make the process much easier. What I do is I go to Pexels, and find 3 stock videos that are eye catching and relatable to my song. Then I put it into Premiere, edit the colors to make them pop (a lot of Pexels videos have pretty dull coloring so you might have to edit some coloring into them), put  15 seconds of my audio and export them. 3 days before release, I also pay $5 to a specific Fiverr freelancer who creates ""OUT NOW"" videos for Insta reels. Now I have 4 videos that I can use for Insta/Facebook ads. They have a pretty good algorithm where they will test all 4 videos for a few days, then identify which video is performing the best, and then start pushing that video out.

I got 10k streams in just 1 month just using Groover. But it does require you to sift through all of their curators, open up their spotify and see which playlists they have, how many followers the playlists have, etc. If it looks good, then you can pitch to them. Over the course of 5 releases, I just made a list of curators that meet my criteria and saved them in a list. Now when I release a new song, I can just 1 click and submit to all. By now I have an unspoken connection between some curators that will now basically always playlist me because they like me as an artist and the production quality of my tracks.

One, as you've seen, is the wag bag type solution. They are basically single use, and although they can be used more than once, it's a bit of a pain, and you need to leave them in that case on a toilet seat frame of some kind, bucket, etc. Feces can streak down the side of the bag, and they can be smelly if left open obviously. The idea is to not get urine inside either.

Another solution is just a waste bucket type toilet. Basically it can be a bucket with a seat that can be sealed up. 

But a better solution than that is a portable cassette toilet. Often not much bigger than the bucket, with a seat. Thetford and Dometic are common brands. Easily stored. They have a sort of pump flush, work best with some liquid inside, and have fittings for easy cleaning. Multi use. It can be dumped into regular toilets, or even at an RV dump station. You don't generate tons of plastic bag waste.

There are more complex ones, but they're overkill for occasional camping, like compost toilets or built in ones.

If you do rafting or want a more outdoorsy/non RVish version of the portable cassette toilet, there are alternatives, from DIY ""groovers"" to say the Eco-Safe toilets, often sold at river supply places. They don't flush or require water to work. A common one fits in a military surplus 20mm rocket box. https://www.nrs.com/eco-safe-toilet-system/plfk About 50 uses.

Yes, that's a lot of layers, but also thickness plays a huge part, so super thin leather won't matter if you have 10 layers!

So, If I was doing that, after cutting I would use a Stitch Groover, it cuts a nice channel, makes your stitches nice and flush with the leather, I would use that on every visible face, so any area you'll be able to see.

I then use a stitch chisel, I think it's called, It's a tool you smack with a mallet and it makes holes/marks where you're going to stitch, so your holes will line up perfectly!

I then stitch, and then it's burnish time! first off I use a blade to trim any leather, so it's flush, I then use a file, and then sandpaper, course stuff, I then burnish with a burnisher tool and I use gum tragacanth, I get it flush, but then I sand it again with a fine sandpaper, around 600 grit, and then grum trag/burnish again, and you can repeat that process untill you get super smooth edges ;)",,,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_10s0dgl,,,False,/r/Leathercraft/comments/10s0dgl/first_attempt_how_do_yall_do_it_edges_uneven/j6z4f3i/,public,False,t1_j6z4f3i,,,[],1675376763.0,r/Leathercraft,0,,,,,,,groover,,,,,,,1491942718.0,1678281696.0

   As for their tools, the general leather tools edge bevelers, stitch groovers, and the like are good solid middle ground. They are deffinatly upgrades to the baseline tandy/craftool we have in the US. However the Barry King, HSBT, and Ron's real top end are objectively nicer, more polished tools than what Oka offers. 
    Speaking for myself specifically, the real standouts in Oka's product line are the cutting tools, skiving knife, swivle knife blades, and french edgers. Kept sharp and maintained they're a real pleasure to use. As well as the stamping tools for tooling leather. These also perform above their price point and much closer to the more expensive ""pro"" stamping tools.

At any rate, if I remember correctly, they played the Night Version of HLTW in the movie during a party scene or something and I was instantly hooked.  The problem was I never put two and two together at the time that it was Duran.  It was a short time later that I finally figured it out (we didn’t have mtv at home until early ‘84 and local stations were not playing them much in 82/83).   It wasn’t until fall of ‘83 that I dove into Seven and the Ragged Tiger and then picked up the first two albums and there it was on Rio!  Then I grabbed the 12” singles and boom…the night version was in my hands!

For ages I’ve always felt like it was one of the greatest songs ever made.  I still do actually…the night version anyway.  These days, I’ve seen Duran live many many times and they always play it so it’s worn out it’s welcome a bit.  I’d give anything for them to do the night version live because it’s such a groover.

If they like it then they share on their socials and put your song on their playlists.  

ROI for this varies greatly.  Some playlists, these influencers just create out of thin air in order to try and build their following by making the submitters like/follow and artificially pump their numbers.  Sometimes there's no playlist at all and they'll just post an Instagram story with not much info and 24 hours later it's gone and that's all you got for your $2.  

And surprise, there aren't a lot of playlists out there for jazz.  At least not ones who are on those influencer services.  A lot of ""lofi chill jazzy hiphop beatz"" type stuff.  And a lot of them refuse covers.  Probably long-term it's worth it to throw $50 or $100 at each just to get the ball rolling on Spotify's algorithms, but accept that you may not see that money back short term.  Maybe 1-3 years later you'll break even on it.

\- Fill in your profile, and choose max 1-2-3 subgenres total, so you get relevant recommendations  
\- Once your campaign draft started and the information about your track filled out \[don't forget to add the language and release date\], use the filters by Type &gt; Radios and don't hesitate to also filter by Genre and why not countries if you're targeting certain countries in particular

It’s pretty inspiring on that level and I have a bit of paranoid schizo a times.  I get the cia being a way to understand your condition at times also, the way you feel like things are ‘directing’ you. 

I guess things are directing us, like need to eat comes from hunger or needing to draw comes through a need to express one’s self, walking in the forest comes from needing to be grounded by Mother Nature and their all a form of intelligence the universe is manifesting through You as a way of expressing itself. a hungry universe a creative universe A universe that needs the right amount of gravitational pull….

I’ve been on reddit for 2 months straight and conversed with a lot of people. It’s been wonderful to give and share and learn. I’ve got some really heart felt compliments and know I’ve helped out a few people which makes me happy.

Now it’s time for a rest. i Haven’t heard from you in three days?, being boarder line I don’t know if that is a long time not to hear from someone or not? But I hope yr ok? I can see through your book/writing you have the capaciTy when your not overwhelmed by your condition to reflect back on your experiences and I guess that reflection, and your friend Vince helps you stay on track.   


Your zaney free spirit and the little details about the mountains in your book have inspired me to start exploring a 100klm (80 miles) walk in the forest!, I’ve been tied to a few blocks of the city for 2 years….and I know I need a break away from this screen. And to do some wholesome things like embroid sayings on bags and take journeys on the train looking out the window…sit in the forest and listen to nature, and wander and dream. Thank you for inspiring me and maybe down the track I’ll re-engage with you on reddit?, till then take care.   


Ps I like what you said :you may as well be ‘banana pudding’! BPD’s also have serious identity issues ….so I can well relate, but itS also in a way makes us less ego because we dont have that ‘certainty’ that others do that ends up tripping them up when they find out that they were incorrect….and they then resist and become hard people….it’s a big trauma for them, but for us we were always dancing on the right rope anyway, to ove to one side or the other isn’t to hard to do…..

They also have radios and a WHOLE bunch of other type of curators and managers that review music. With Groover, all you do is search for who you want to submit to, wrote a pitch, and Groover handles the rest. Very simple and not too pricey.

What's really ignorant, however, is someone to not just say something sucks, but then go into great detail, like you did, about *why* it sucks.  You're just layering on more opinions.  You may as well say ""I don't like this show!

Turns out it's got a bunch of stuff I don't really use and, after a few projects, a few things I'd like to upgrade, and a few things I needed that it *didn't* come with. That said, it got me started and I love it.

Heres what it came with that I actually use(d):
- Scratch Awl - use it to trace patterns and poke holes for locating things
- Pricking Chisels - for stich holes - I'd like to get some nice polished ones sometime but these are fine as I'm learning
- Like ~12 spools of flat waxed thread in different colors - in retrospect, I wish the thread was a bit thinner but I'm using it
- Burnishing tool - for edges
- Six needles in three sizes - only used one size until I bought a full pack of what I like
- Cheapo Exacto Knife - really pretty garbage - replaced (mostly) with a cheap rotary cutter that is insanely great
- Steel ruler
- Little pinch scissors
- Multi-headed tool - has edge-beveling heads, a creasing head, and a thread line gouge(?) - I really only use a single edge beveler head on this because it's a pain to change out all the time. I really want to get a standalone creaser

What it didn't come with but I realized I needed/wanted:
- Stitching Pony
- Mallet
- Cutting mat
- Dividers
- Tokonole - for those sweet shiny edges

What it additionally came with that I'm not sure I'll ever use:
- Two different rotary stitching pricker things
- Huge needles and super tiny needles
- Another pack of variously shaped needles
- Stitching Awl(?) - awl with a hole and a slot for thread
- Leather finger covers - haven't felt the need for these
- Thimble ring thing - ditto and doesn't fit anyway
- Hole punches - these would kind of be useful I guess but the snaps I bought came with their own

Edit: This seems to be very close to the one I got:

I've read good things about eco weld, even though it looked terrible in your video. I let my contact cement dry tacky to the touch before sticking my two pieces together and it forms a near instant bond, which will probably help the problem I saw you have.

Even after watching your positive experience, I'm inclined to believe that if someone really wants to get into the hobby without piecemealing their tools out from multiple places, a 50 dollar kit with the absolute bare minimums ( with the mindset that 95% of the things need to be replaced ) probably is the way to go.When I started I purchased a 120$ kit at the advice of another redditor and it was absolute garbage, I think within a month or two I only used the scratch awl, wood slicker and needles.

Now two things I want to try out going into 2023, never watch another kit video, and be nice to new leather friends.  
Good luck!  


Oh yeah parting thoughts, I hated using a stitching groover. Like if I were to rate switching from stitch groover to wing divider -   
stitch groover, 2/5  
wing divider 5/5  


That said, when I switched I also switched from using diamonds to using quality french irons, and due to their slim profile and a quality product ( kevin lee french irons ) they don't stray NEARLY as much as diamonds do - I understand your plight of having your irons wander. Since you seem like another Canadian, and I imagine you'll be ordering from OA Leather, I'll say in my experience when you're putting 4 layers together, 3-4 oz is getting kinda on the chonk side.

Newman was an aspiring artist and happened to call by at Apple that morning. He can be seen in the live scenes wearing a maroon jacket and standing beside a chimney stack behind The Beatles, and at the end of the concert retrieving the painting.](https://www.beatlesbible.com/1969/01/30/the-beatles-rooftop-concert-apple-building/)

&gt;“I was doing these paintings that were kind of science fiction, Star Warsy sort of planets – planets with lots of moons. Odd stuff like that. I was living in a weird fantasy world at the time and I had this idea of just trying to just make a living really and, of course, I was still incredibly a fan of The Beatles and everything that they did and I decided, one morning, to take a couple of paintings up to London and see if I could get into the Apple headquarters in Savile Row. I was kind of mincing up and down the road with these paintings under my arm trying to see if I had the balls to actually go up the steps and bang on the door, a van was parked outside unloading equipment and I just walked by this guy got out of the van and said, “Tom. What are you doing here?”, it was a guy called Adrian Woolf who lived in our street where I lived in Perivale…

&gt;Anyway, I said, “Adrian, what are you doing here?” He said, “We’re filming the Beatles, they are gonna play on the roof.” I said, “Fuck me. You’re kidding” and he said, “No. No. Here.” and he gave me this little tiny flight case with some lenses or whatever it was in it and he said, “Here you are. Grab hold of that and come in and I’ll get you in.” And I was shitting myself, of course, but I just followed him so I became Adrian Woolf’s roadie for about half an hour, taking crap into Apple and going up the stairs about four or five times right up to the roof. There wasn’t a lift so we had to use the stairs and I couldn’t believe it, it was like walking into the Magical Mystery Tour, there were all these little dolly birds and geezers with trendy flairs on (chuckles), straight out of Carnaby Street and, amongst them, there’s the Beatles wandering about. So I helped Adrian up with all this equipment and Ringo’s drum kit was set up there so I put this painting that I wanted to see if I could sell, this kind of space-age thing, behind Ringo’s drum kit and I just hid on the roof ’cause I thought I’d get chucked out by Mal Evans who was wandering about with Neil [Aspinall] if they didn’t recognise me. But I suppose I looked fairly groovy ’cause I had Beatles haircut like we all had anyway, so I could have passed for any groover (chuckles) and everyone in Apple all looked similar so maybe it was just that I never got picked on.

&gt;Anyway they came on and it was an amazing, amazing gig. I’d never seen them live before – ever – so I was amazed at just how much like The Beatles they sounded. You know, I mean, but not just like The Beatles, it was spot on, there was no mistakes, it was absolutely perfect. They played ‘Get Back’ and, in fact, they were recording it as well, I didn’t know that at the time but they were recording it in the basement. Actually, I used their basement studio a few years after that to record Paul’s brother, Mike McCartney. The version that came out on record of ‘Get Back’ is the one they did on the roof, as far as I can make out. I haven’t checked it note for note but it’s got all the nuance of the live version and they were just playing through little tiny Fender, you know, little baby Fender amp and a Fender PA system and they were just miked up with half a dozen mikes and it was the best fucking rock ‘n’ roll sound I’ve ever heard really. The cops came out and complained because of the noise but actually it wasn’t really very loud, it was just that they were scared that it was kind of revolutionary what they were doing and, at the time of course, there hadn’t been a revolution yet. But it was an incredible experience, it really was amazing, and bizarrely I sold the painting. I got 25 quid for the painting from Neil Aspinall who, bless him is dead now, but 25 quid in 1969, or whenever it was, ’70 was a lot of money, it was more than I’d ever had in one go anyway (chuckles).

I feel like this situation is super similar to any audition. You want to show that you're taking the training seriously, so:

* Be five minutes early to everything, at least. Best practice would be to show up early enough to help set up whatever is happening next. 
* Don't be a pest, but offer help to the guides as often as you can. It's also nice to help your fellow potential guides, as this shows leadership and communication. 
* Ask questions, don't be afraid, show genuine curiosity. They'll let you know if you're asking questions about something too advanced or that they'll show you later. 
* Don't be above any task. They're going to want to hire someone who's gonna help share the load, not act scared or squeamish when it's time to clean the groover. The more you're willing to do the ""bitch work"" for lack of a better term, the more they'll want to hire you. 
* There will be some made up/contrived situations for you, GIVE THEM 100%! I couldn't believe how many folks didn't swim as hard as they could during strainer drills or whatever. Practice for the real situation. Same goes for when you're on the guide stick. So many people were too shy when leading the boat for some reason. And showing off how you plan to interact with customers is often just as important as showing that you're a proficient boater. They can teach you to paddle, they can't teach you how to be outgoing, engaging, and attentive to the customers. 
* Same goes for the safety talk, when they ask for volunteers to go through the safety talks, DO IT! And do it right. Don't hesitate or worry about looking cool in front of the guides/other students. You should treat every situation as if you're talking to customers. 
* Be happy and helpful during clean up, rigging, trailering, basically any off the water sitation. 
* Stand up front! Have a ""front row of the class"" attitude without being annoying. 
* Take your cues from the lead guide! Chances are they make the final decision or have the most input on the hiring decision. Do things the way they want them done. 
* There will be a ""cool guide."" They're likely to be the veteran who's been there too long. They're aloof, full of shortcuts and ways to half ass the job. You can be friends with them, but DO NOT imitate them.
* Socialize with the guides after hours. Where I was, you camped out behind the warehouse. The guides would hang out, camp with us, prep meals, etc. They're going to want to hire someone they can get along with, so don't go off and only socialize with other students. Find a balance between both.

It has to reach something vital. The common service pistol cartridges aren’t reliable fight stoppers unless you can provide a high degree of confidence you can delivery those rounds in vital areas. If you can guarantee that, well shit, even a .22LR from a handgun can be lethal. 

I mean, look at the Jared Reston incident in Jacksonville, FL back in 2008. He was shot in the face with .45 ball. The offender was shot multiple times with .40 S&amp;W Winchester SXT - the incident finally resolved when they grappled and Reston finally put a stop to it by putting three rounds into the offenders head at point blank range. https://www.recoilweb.com/shots-fired-jared-reston-survival-gear-154993.html

The FBI ballistic testing protocol also has to factor performance through intermediate barriers - things like auto bod sheet metal, automotive safety glass, etc because in an LE application, those things matter.

ATLANTA — Tuesday’s showdown between Sen. Raphael G. Warnock (D) and Republican challenger Herschel Walker is the product of an unusual general election runoff system that was pushed by a powerful Georgia segregationist who sought to blunt the power of Black voters in the 1960s.

While 10 states use runoffs in primary elections, Georgia and Louisiana are the only two that do so in general elections. Georgia’s system was created in 1964 after the urging of Denmark Groover, who blamed Black voters for a reelection loss and proposed runoffs. Groover later acknowledged the runoff system was intended to suppress Black political representation.

While runoff elections had existed for decades in Southern primaries, Georgia’s enthusiastic adoption of two-round voting came as a way of “ensuring a conservative White candidate won an election,” said Ashton Ellett, a political historian and archivist at the University of Georgia.

“A runoff makes it harder for folks who have less resources to vote. This was before advanced in-person voting or [voting was offered] by mail and when we had many other unfair, iniquitous, undemocratic policies. It wasn’t for a partisan advantage so much as an ideological and cultural one,” Ellett said.

Now, 58 years later, that system is part of the first race in history where two Black men are competing for a U.S. Senate seat, after neither Warnock nor Walker garnered 50 percent of the vote in last month’s election. Walker was born just before the system was created, and Warnock was born soon after. Neither has discussed the system on the trail, and neither campaign has responded to requests for comment on Georgia’s use of runoffs.

Runoffs are common in Georgia’s local and down-ballot races, like contests for the General Assembly, but the race between Warnock and Walker is only the 12th statewide runoff since the system was enacted.

Voting rights groups have been pushing to get rid of the system. State officials estimate that administering another election will cost taxpayers at least $10 million, and campaigns and political groups are expected to spend even more than that.",,,,,False,False,[],True,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_zdrzfh,,,False,/r/politicyl/comments/zdrzfh/georgias_runoff_system_was_created_to_dilute/iz3072x/,restricted,False,t1_iz3072x,,,[],1670292820.0,r/politicyl,0,,,,,,,groover,,,,,,,1603925488.0,1673140926.0

Georgia’s Dec. 6 runoff election pitting Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock against Republican Herschel Walker is historic for having two Black candidates representing major parties on that state’s ballot. But the voting law that mandated a runoff when neither candidate won a majority in November’s election is actually a vestige of racist legislation.

Since the 1960s, Georgia’s majority voting law has required a candidate get 50 percent of the vote or more in order to be declared the winner, and was introduced by a staunch segregationist legislator named Denmark Groover. Even now, the law “makes it more difficult for any group which forms a minority in the population to elect its candidates of choice,” regardless of the candidates’ ethnicity, historian and California Institute of Technology professor Morgan Kousser told the PBS NewsHour’s Nicole Ellis.

Watch the conversation in the player above.

When so-called “white-only primary” elections were deemed unconstitutional in 1946, Black voter registration surged across the South, including in Georgia. In 1940, an estimated 250,000 Black southerners were registered to vote and that number rose to 775,000 by 1948, according to data from the National Park Service.

When Groover lost reelection to the Georgia House of Representatives in 1958 despite winning the majority of the white vote, data from segregated polling places in Macon revealed that Black voters contributed to the upset victory by his opponent, Kousser said. In his book, “Colorblind Injustice: Minority Voting Rights and the Undoing of the Second Reconstruction,” Kousser writes that Groover’s opponent “triumphed by garnering black ballots by a five-to-one margin.”

As part of the civil rights movement of the 1960s, advocates, judges, and policymakers pressed for expanded and more equitable voting rights.

They might be a regional or national practice (unsure), but they were abundant and readily available in my area.


Main thing is, just make sure they're compatible with your insurance. And I hope you have good insurance too, because they're not cheap if you're in the US. But it's so worth it! Your mind &amp; gut are heavily interconnected, and it could be affecting your quality of life more than you realize.


Are you experiencing any other symptoms in addition to bleeding? If so, TELL YOUR DOCTOR. Also, download a health journal app and start logging everything. (I use Cara Care). Food, sleep, water, fiber, exercise, meds, stress. Work with your doctor to nail down the most prominent causes of your symptoms. May take trial and error, but trust the process and find a doc you like.


Stool irregularity &amp; bleeding can have a number of causes, from dietary to lifestyle to genetic. It could be anything from a food sensitivity, hemorrhoids, anal fissures, upper bleeding, IBS/IBD, etc. depending on a very wide variety of things. Your doc is your best guide to rule out the non-factors.


Edited to add: it will probably be a weeks-long, months-long process for your doc to help you rule each thing out. Took me about 3 months and I'm still going, but I did have a major breakthrough, so I got some crucial answers for myself. Your doc will be able to analyze and help you navigate your specific situation.


Your doctor will also be able to order blood tests or perhaps even a colonoscopy or endoscopy if they feel it's warranted (I've had all of the above). DM me if you want to compare notes about experiences or if you have any questions about my suggestions to you.


But most importantly - GI bleeding is NO BUENO so I strongly recommend seeing a doctor NOW! They will be able to examine the whole picture and get you some comprehensive care. You deserve it especially while you're young. Do this for yourself now, because it doesn't get any easier when you get older!!",,,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_z2aehk,,,False,/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/z2aehk/why_does_it_bleed_when_i_poop/ixgpu3j/,public,False,t1_ixgpu3j,,,[],1669193292.0,r/TooAfraidToAsk,0,,,,,,,groover,,,,,,,1422849352.0,1671088965.0

**Brian Tichy** (Dead Dasies, Foreigner, etc.) - Just a super powerful and groovy drummer, obvious Bonham influence without trying too much to be him. Huge sound, great technique.

**Ilan Rubin** (Nine Inch Nails) - Just a highly skilled power groover and always interesting.

**Kenneth Kapstad** (Spidergawd. Motopsycho) - This guy is high on my list, jazz roots. Unique style, lots of toms he uses so beautifully. Go check him out with Spidergawd.

**Don Brewer** (Grand Funk Railroad) - One of my favourites from the 70s. Although he was a huge cunt considering how he fucked over the singer.

&gt; Unless there’s only two candidates, it’s very hard, in most cases, to reach that majority threshold,” Brown says. Historians point out that under plurality voting, which is the more common system where the candidate with most votes wins, politicians often feared that white voters could end up divided between multiple candidates.

The politician who introduced it to Georgia literally admitted that he was racially motivated and was a segregationist. 

&gt;According to a 2007 study by the National Park Service twenty years after the runoff practice was put in place Groover admitted, “If you want to establish if I was racially prejudiced, I was. If you want to establish that some of my political activity was racially motivated, it was.”

It was purposefully introduced to decrease the odds of minority candidates winning in a general election by eliminating ""spoilers"" that split the white vote between multiple candidates where black and minority voters would vote in blocs.

&gt;A feature of Georgia elections is the requirement for 50%-plus-one majorities in general and primary elections, triggering runoff elections if no candidate receives a majority. From 1898 to 1962, the Democratic Party used a combination of the white primary and the county unit system to ensure that only white rural voters' preferences were reflected in the de facto election of political offices across the state, although the white primary was abolished in the federal case King v. Chapman (1945). After the county unit system was struck down by the Supreme Court case Gray v. Sanders (accompanied by the election of Carl Sanders, who became the first Democrat to be nominated for governor by popular vote since the establishment of the county unit system), the General Assembly passed a bill to switch future Georgia elections to runoff voting. The bill was introduced and sponsored by Macon legislator Denmark Groover, who proposed that runoff voting ""would again provide protection which … was removed with the death of the county unit system"" and warned that **""[W]e have got to go the majority vote because all we have to have is a plurality and the [no no word]s and the pressure groups and special interests are going to manipulate this State and take charge.""**[8]

&gt;However, the following ascendance of the Republican Party culminated in the 1992 defeat of incumbent Wyche Fowler by Republican Paul Coverdell by runoff, despite Fowler leading the first round by a plurality. This led the Georgia Legislature, then controlled by Democrats, to change the state's laws requiring a run-off election only if the winning candidate received less than 45% of the vote. In the 1996 Senate election, the winner, Democrat Max Cleland won with only 48.9% (1.4% ahead of Republican Guy Millner) thus avoiding a run-off. In 2005 after Republicans took control of the legislature, the run-off requirement was changed back to 50%, in the same bill which implemented a requirement for Voter ID.[9]

__________

From 1917, until the Supreme Court struck it down in 1963, Georgia had a “County Unit” system similar to the electoral college which heavily favored rural over urban *(read: heavily black)* counties

&gt;	In 1963 … Denmark Groover – a staunch segregationist – proposed the adoption of runoff voting, as it ***“would again provide protection which … was removed with the death of the county unit system.”***

&gt;	The fear among whites was that if elections were left to plurality voting, the white vote could be split among several different candidates, while African Americans could – in theory – vote as a single bloc for an African American candidate, who could end up winning with the most votes overall.

&gt;	Groover was quoted by State Representative James Mackay as having said on the floor of the Georgia House of Representatives that with plurality voting, ***“the Negroes and the pressure groups and special interests are going to manipulate this State and take charge.”***

&gt;	However, by adopting runoff voting, even if white voters split their vote in the first round and an African American somehow made it to the second round, white voters – from both parties – would still have a chance to unite behind the white candidate to ensure victory. Groover himself advertised his runoff voting bill as being designed to ***“prevent the Negro bloc vote from controlling the elections.”***

Plan partially adopted in 1964 (primaries), and fully adopted in 1966 (general elections)

&gt;	John R. Dunne – who served from 1990 to 1994 as an assistant U.S. attorney general for the Civil Rights Division – argued that Georgia’s runoff voting system has had “a demonstrably chilling effect on the ability of Blacks to become candidates for public office.”

I'd recommend at least two - I've got a larger one that's just an 8""  piece of leather glued to a 2x4 and flush to the edges (and an 800 grit diamond stone mounted on the other end of the 2x4), I'll use this one primarily when sharpening and finishing edges. Usually secured with an F-clamp or into my bench vice so I can use more pressure when necessary. 

Your second one just needs to be portable and light, something that can be kept nearby and not in the way. Mine's just a piece of 3/4"" scrap wood with a roughly 2.5""x6"" strip of leather on it, and a handle to grip it with. A quick strop on it before using a blade to cut leather and it's like cutting through butter. 

My third one is just a 4""x4"" piece of 8oz-10oz that floats around, I carved thin shallow dual channels into it and applied compound deep into them so I can polish/strop my edge bevelers as well, definitely would recommend to be just as important as your blades. 

Lol just make sure you're using veg tan, and gluing your leather grain/smooth side down, applying your compound to the fuzzy suede side. I totally didn't do this when I started learning, and just couldn't figure out why my compound wouldn't stick and flake off if I managed building it up.

You can also try manually browsing around Spotify and find other playlists by finding an artist you vibe with and seeing which playlists they were added to, and clicking on each of them to see if there is any contact info in their profiles.

And this is what I had wish someone had done for me. Three things. Well more then three in just gonna say what happened. I think the biggest thing was the place I had it done was a surgery center and their thing is getting people in and out as fast as they can. So care of patients and accurate diagnosis/picture taking was not the priority.

So I went to Boreland Groover because I had suspected problems with gastric emptying. The ordered colonoscopy and endoscopy even though I didn't want it. And neither is the test for gastroparisis. 

I live alone and don't have a big support network. They have to have someone pick you up. After the procedure. ...this is problematic for me. My mom would pick me up but she is never on time and always late. More on this later.

My problems started with the bowel prep. For the prescription even with insurance it was going be over a hundred dollars...so I went with the OTC. Dulcolax and miralax.

So after no food for over twelve hours I took 2 dulcolax and over 100g of miralax per instructions. You drink the miralax over an hour and a half. Then take two more dulcolax. This is supposed to induce diarrhea or whatever. Welllll..... It sat in my stomach and then I spent all night vomiting.  Couldn't keep down BP meds, pain meds, or anti nausea meds. If even saliva made it to my stomach it caused vomiting.  

So I called the surgery center next day, told then I was dangerous dehydrated super high Blood pressure and thought I should go in to ER. 

They said it wasn't a problem and to come in earlier as they had less patients and the Dr could do the procedure. No concern...just come in sooner. 

I said my ride still won't be in any earlier. I had arranged for my mom to pick me up, she's a school teacher though and wouldn't be able to get there till the later time. 

So I get there, the office was crowded. Lots of people, a nurses with heavy perfume walked by and my mast cell started acting up. Headache. 

They get me back there, get things set up. I let them know I had EDS, nurse said she never heard of it, big surprise. 

I told them medications I was sensitive to so they didn't put any pain meds in my system other then anti nausea. Which is ok but made things worse on waking up. 

I did the procedure seemed like it went ok, however the attending nurses were brutal upon coming out of the anesthesia.

I woke up choking, which I already have a problem with just choking randomly from EDS stuff. I asked for oxygen and they wouldn't give me any. The nurses lied about how long I had been awake for and said I had been up and talking to them which wasn't true. The nurses said I had to sit up and I told them I want ready. I have pots, and herniated disks and sitting up even when I'm feeling ok isn't easy. 

I was on my side and they tried to force me into a fully upright position without letting turn to be laying on my back or helping me to turn over fully. This could have seriously hurt me. I told them, I wasn't ready. I told them I had EDS and they were hurting me, I told then to stop and they wouldn't.

I'm a tall and heavy man. Over 6 foot and 300 lbs. They tried to unlock the bed and push it up, and not only did the bed not go up ( which could have seriously injured me) it went back down because I dont move that way and the nurses finger or hand or something got pinched. 

I cursed at the one nurse and told her to get the fuck out of my partitioned area. 

This propmted the head nurse to come and at first she was like, you have to leave you can't be hurting my nurses. Then I explained they were hurting me that I had EDS, herniated disks and they were trying to force me up while I was still on my side. 

She became extremely apologetic. Then asked me for what ilshe could do. I said I woke up covered in my own spit, choking could I please have a damp wash cloth and my glasses. ""She was like...they didn't even help you get your glasses on? ""

Then she helped me get situated and when she saw I had a walking cane she became very apologetic. When you look at me ... doesn't look like anything is wrong....so I think when she saw the cane. 

It was terrible. I felt abused. 
If  I were to have that procedure again I would go to the center beforehand and meet with the Dr and anesthesiologist and head nurse to discuss my needs. I would make sure it is a place that is focused on patient care and not how many surgeries they can do in a day. I would insist on having the procedure recorded or I would hide my phone with the microphone on. I would also insist on having an advocate there with me as soon as I got out of surgery so that I would be protected in what is a very compromised state where communication and advocating for yourself is next to impossible, which I felt the nurses took advantage of me to try to get me out of their area to make room for the next patient as soon as possible. And when I wasn't moving as quickly as they would like...that's when they started to get ugly.

They won't let you drive, or sign any papers after the procedure because of the anesthesia. If I hadn't literally been with it enough to physically fightbfor myself I could have been really hurt by the nurses rough treatment.

Other things to improve will help the next project, many have been mentioned here... Stitch groover, or wing dividers to keep your stitch line straight and even to the edge. 
Back stitch a few holes at your ending points, and leave a little less thread to melt off... It's a balance, but you need enough to stop it unravelling, but less so it melts down and blends in.
But the main thing is consistency... Every stitch needs to be done the same way, with the same tension to get a 'perfect' result (if that's even possible!)

Luckily, most of these options are completely personal preference. A wing divider and Groover are often used for the same task, but they aren’t exactly interchangeable. If the Groover is sharp, it probably isn’t going to just lightly mark the leather. Personally, I’d go with a standard wing divider and see if in the future you really want your stitched inset into the surface of the leather. You can probably save some money on the wing divider. $80 is a little higher than I’ve seen. 

The hammer or maul choice is more about what weight you’re using. I’ve done both shapes, and I prefer the maul because of weight distribution, but that’s just my experience. You don’t need to be afraid of the maul slipping—just practice not aiming for fingers! A poly maul is my favorite, with a good heft. Over 16oz. 

You’ll accumulate several edgers if you keep this up. Honestly, the sizing of edgers in mm never felt super clear to me across suppliers. But I have a .6mm and a 1.3 that I use the most often. There are many good budget options out there, but I don’t know if they ship to you. I hope the video helps. Feel free to send a chat. I’d be happy to answer specifics. Take care!

Also Skye is not faster than Grover at all when using the vine. One vine can be enough to escape from her. Also groover has vine tech that allows him to reach further areas, can stack multiple vines in one go, and can even do this one trick where he goes really far with it so Skye being faster than Grover is completely false.

Another thing is that you shouldn't just either go to the player or on the point because going on the point puts you in danger more. Instead find a safe place to be at but  close to your team so you can heal them while you heal yourself while watching out for flankers. Unless most of the team is dead and a few people are on the point then go to them to help you out.

Also groover is not just best at just healing the tank and no one else he can be with multiple people and have the team coordinate with you and the map. Another thing to know is that you never chill with the sniper as the team do what they do. Otherwise you're ruining your teams chances of winning and giving away the snipers position. The sniper are mainly fine without a healer since they dish out a lot of damage and are constantly mob my especially kinessa.

Supports have several roles and are versatile. Your not supposed to be with just the damage as flank as a single healer but with the team. Flanks can do there thing and come to you when they need heals or you come to them while they come to you same with damages depending on champion.

**1.** 2017 article. Trae Shordy is a close associate to Yungeen Ace, a popular Jacksonville rapper and gang member. They rep ""ATK"" - the police think it stands for ""Ace's Top Killers"".

**2.** TJ on Gun Violence Memorial, contains many more articles. This murder was over personal tensions allegedly: Many say it is what sparked a high profile war between local gangs.

In 2018, Yungeen Ace (Kenyata Bullard) was shot eight times in a car, in a [quadruple shooting](https://www.news4jax.com/news/2018/06/07/police-name-3-killed-by-gunfire-on-town-center-parkway/) on a Jacksonville roadway that went nationally viral. His blood brother Trevon Bullard (18 years old), and his two best friends, Royale ""23"" Smith (18 years old) and Jercoby ""4"" Groover (19 years old) were all murdered.

Supposedly these incidents are related, in a gang war in Duval County that has been publicized greatly through rap music and has seen many more bodies drop since 2018.

**3.** Old Facebook post from one of the young female victims detailing the situation and the pain they're dealing with behind it

**4.** Trae Shordy (to the right) in jail

**5.** Original 2017 arrest warrant

**6.** Trae Shordy wrote a letter to the judge after he was found guilty and sentenced to life. You can see he mentions Ace being a suspect (as per the state), and the fact he paid for his lawyer.

TJ, or Tweaking Jit, is mocked by Yungeen Ace in the 2021 viral rap hit [""Who I Smoke""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFfGgeddAc4&amp;ab_channel=Spinabenz).

You should be able to use a radius groover that is not wider than the groove. You can profile the whole thing with it as long as your groover is deep enough to reach in there and not wider than the groove itself.

You can use tool nose geometry shift g code, or simply shift your tool in z in your offsets.

Say you are using a .0625” wide radius groover, I would come in on the center of the groove, plunge down to almost finished diameter.

Then, you can use z shift geo and tool nose position shift codes to profile both sides 

Say your groover is tool 3

#2103=#2103-.0312

This will shift your tool in Z back by the amount of your tool nose radius

#2303=8

This will put your tool in tool nose position 8

You will need to run the same code at the end of your block to shift your tool back. 

#2103=#2103+.0312
Return to previous z offset

#2303=3

Return to tool nose position 3

Once you join that community if you make a good impression you’ll be invited on other trips later on. So you should not be approaching this as if it’s your only chance. It definitely is not your only chance. 

The Grand Canyon is a different kind of experience than any white water you from before. Some of the Rapids are really only class two by difficulty,  but the volume of the river is probably unlike anything you’ve encountered before. The waves and holes in many rapids may be relatively in consequential, but the runouts are usually more turbulent than anything that you’ve experienced before, and swims might be longer and colder than what you are used to. 

There are fatalities on the Colorado every single season. Most of those are rafters; in fact I’m not sure that I’ve personally heard a story of a kayaker dying on that river, but that may relate to the fact that kayakers are out numbered by rafters something like 20 or 30 to one. The thing is, whereas most river fatalities in general are from foot entrapments or pins, most fatalities on the Grand are flush drownings- simply a swim going longer and deeper than the person was prepared for. That is a significant risk that I would want to novice kayaker to be aware of on that river. 

The other thing I would caution a newbie about is the sheer length of the river. From Lee’s to diamond Creek is 228 miles of paddling.  The Lake Mead takeout is almost another third of that distance. On my trip we generally did between 15 and 20 miles a day. By contrast, my prior kayaking experience seldom included more than 15 miles a day one or two days a week. It adds up and gets pretty tiring. 

All that being said, if you can bring your kayak without being much of a burden on the rest of the group, I would say go for it, just set reasonable expectations. Don’t expect to paddle the whole thing in your kayak. Don’t expect to be kayaking any of the big rapids. Run a couple of GC three and GC four rapids to see how you feel. 

I think you should definitely be looking for ways to add value for others in how you approach this trip. Volunteer for groover duty, always help set up the group camp,  cook something spectacular if you have the opportunity to cook for the group, and just overall figure out what you can do to be more of a benefit  than a burden to the rest of the crew. Kayakers have kind of reputation within the Grand Canyon private boating community as being freeloaders on rafters, so my request to you is that you make sure to contradict rather than contribute to that reputation. 

This trip can be an epic experience and I know very few people who have regretted such a trip. Just bring extra humility and an attitude of service to your crew and you’ll do fine regardless of whether you kayak.",,,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_y7j948,,,False,/r/whitewater/comments/y7j948/how_new_to_kayaking_is_too_new_to_seriously/isv8iof/,public,False,t1_isv8iof,,,[],1666134516.0,r/whitewater,0,,,,,,,groover,,,,,,,1435979679.0,1667924680.0

The translators went for verbs/phrases such as:  
  
* enfourcher son groove   
* obtenir son groove  
* montrer son groove à quelqu'un  
* montrer ses talents de grooveur  
* ***groover*** (je groove, tu grooves, il/elle groove, nous groovons, vous groovez, ils/elles groovent)

TL;DR
This axe sheath is my first project that wasn't just practicing on scrap.  No pony, using tools and scraps from Tandy Leather which is about the only game in town where I live in Ontario.  Ritza 25 (0.8mm) and punched with CraftTool Pro Line stitiching chisels at 2mm spacing. A few questions in the text below for advice. 


I decided to make something I needed as my first project.  The leather is scrap from a Tandy scrap bag they sell in Canada for cheap. I had originally used this to test out dyes and didn't want to waste it.  

I started by tracing the axe into a sheet of card paper and adding some space around the perimeter so that when I would stitich it the axe would still fit (this took two tries to get right).  Cutting the dry scrap piece was okay (I think this wasn't helped by it already being dyed with Eco-Flo all-in-one) but next time I think I'll do all the cutting before I dye unless the vegtan is softer.

I glued the two halves together with water based cement and used a small groover (after using wing dividers?) To notch out the path I wanted to stitch along.  Punching the holes out took some practice and my chisel got stuck a lot, but this might be because they are new.  

I don't have a stitching pony (might make one later) so I used the ""leapfrog"" method that Corter shows online and I was fairly happy with how things turned out.  I assume my stitches would be more consistent with a pony.  My groover could have gone a little further and in terms of looks I think I would have dyed things after grooving. Thoughts?

Setting the snap went okay but I didn't have quite enough thickness to the leather so it's a little wobbly. Ive seen people use a scrap piece under to add some thickness so I may try that next time.  Edges were then beveled with a #2 edger which seemed to work okay.

Before burnishing I did some light sanding with 320 grit (everything got a little fuzzy).  Burnishing was done with water and a small wooden slicker and then followed up with a little bee's wax and the same slicker.  Overall I felt it turned out okay but I definitely need lots of practice with this part.  I've heard that canvas works well here too but I don't have any around. One thing that I don't quite know how to 'fix' is the line that shows from where the two pieces of leather come together. The burnishing helps hide it but I want to understand how to make it durable/uniform, or ""one piece"" and sealed.  My guess is that I either have to use more glue for the two pieces ahead of time, or burnish more times to bind them together?  Thoughts or tips on burnishing are appreciated!

The end product came out better than I expected and I enjoy that it's useful/something I actually needed.

 Morcheeba is solid and firmly rooted in the Bristol sound. Both [Big Calm](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4NXUZspQ7Bx5hSdKGNF9p4GY3vG3N3ZO) and [Who Can You Trust?](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL54D92AC24760D1CC) are solid albums with chill vibes. 

Sneaker Pimps' [Becoming X](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWVJ6uQbGrxx8UFjFTM3Q47y1HKTE_zQc) is a good one that is much more than just 6 Underground. [Bloodsport](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnH2z1aFs0RvWE8qokvEz38yUcGpRbiT9) is also a dope album without the female singer Kelli, but it's still great trip-hop/electronic

Also Canadian Esthero's first album [Breath From Another](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhqJnUCXFZ7Q-KnrmtoNRB_zrpuwOP8zk) is sexy ultra-lounge music, not necessarily trip-hop all the way through but fits the mold.

 Björk has some great moments on Debut, Post, Homogenic, and Vespertine that fall into downtempo and trip-hop. I celebrate her whole catalogue, but I know some stuff isn't everyone's cup of tea. [Possibly Maybe](https://youtu.be/Z32tEf12HCI), [Hunter](https://youtu.be/o4RV4spF0cQ), [Hyperballad](https://youtu.be/UvvNHdNkqb8), [Headphones](https://youtu.be/AEADW63EKKI), [Unravel](https://youtu.be/nCdUX7tRMLw), [Cocoon](https://youtu.be/ZkH7wvXazzs),  [Undo](https://youtu.be/cm1Jc7TjJyc), [Unison](https://youtu.be/wbGg5fdfR1w), [All is Full of Love](https://youtu.be/9TgFXhgPFFI), [All Neon Like](https://youtu.be/qBKOMUAEmEM), [Come to Me](https://youtu.be/2c6ph2oX1wE), and [An Echo A Stain](https://youtu.be/gPimHPLpoww), are all standouts.

And Thievery Corporation's [The Richest Man in Babylon](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW5T7VPVS4HXZQFyZLTObniNt97wWtuP4) is another classic album in the genre, though a bit late to the party.

If you dig Team Sleep, I think those would be good for you to check out.

The ppl from Borland Groover called at least three times in a week tying to cancel our appointment because the insurance still hadn't approved it and my husband finally had to have them change the number to his number because at that point I couldn't stop breaking down every time they called to cancel. The day we went in to get the procedure done we weren't asked for a dime. Why??? BECAUSE I COMPLAINED ABOUT IT ON TWITTER TO CIGNA. It is utterly ridiculous that I have to put shit out on Twitter like I'm a fucking teenager trying to cancel someone. They called in a prescription for me for antibiotics the same day as my ct scan and didn't even tell me until two days later...it took another week and a half for the severe pain to go away and another 4 weeks to just feel like I could even eat maybe a raw vegetable...but I was wrong. I couldn't. So right now most of my veggies are cooked. I've been taking skins off peppers and tomatoes to help. I truly don't even know what I can eat anymore... I vomited for 10 minutes last night after eating at a really nice restaurant with apparently over creamy food. So I'm just completely lost as to what I can eat and am supposed to be referred to a nutritionist. And Cigna just keeps doing it. They won't cover my daughters Vyvanse and its the only thing that was working for her. But that's another story. 

I did look up all the complications from continuing to have diverticulitis so I was aware that it could turn septic so I did monitor my symptoms closely and literally would spend 10 hours a day outside gardening despite having been sedentary for almost 10 years. But I'm stubborn like that and also had adderall to help me get out there. Without the adderall and still on cymbalta I just sat. And was just tired ALL THE TIME which no doubt led to the formation of the diverticula so FUCK THAT CUNT DR WHO PUT ME ON THIS EVIL FUCKING CRAP. Ahem. My apologies.  Adderall must be kicking in! Anyway, cymbalta blocks pain so I have no clue how long these digestion issues were going on.

Also, yeah. CINGULAR. My doctor whom should be WELL AWARE I have pmdd which is synonymous with suicidal ideation. Number one warning for Cingular...may cause suicidal ideation. Like what the actual fuck. And I actually love my Dr. He is just such better than any other doctor I've ever had, but they are trained for acute care only. So now I will be seeking out some holistic solutions and hopefully. 

Again, I am so very sorry for your loss and I really hope that the person who ""forgot"" to give your mom antibiotics knows what their actions caused.

They have some pretty choice stories to tell from the time before groovers.    The thing is whether it decomposes or not, you can't just camp anywhere along a river.   On many trips there are established campsites that may or my not be assigned on permitted or even non-permitted stretches, and due to tamarisk or other terrain features there are just only so many good spots for a group to camp, so the same camps get used over and over.  You can only walk so far before you hit a canyon wall or just rock.  There are no roads or services.  Most of these types of environments you can't dig in very far.  So the shit builds up with every successive group that uses a campsite, you can see where this goes over time.   Even if it wasn't regulated, it'd still be the right thing to do to keep the campsites nice for the next person.   I'm not sure why people are arguing about it, but carrying out your shit and all your waste is standard practice in the western US on these types of trips, and really not a problem to do so.

In that case I would suggest get just what you need, knife, needles, awl/punches, stitch groover, thread. Make a couple card holders and wallets, and when you decide you want to make something else add tools as you need them.
       The vast majority of kits especially geared and marketed to begginers are super cheap and really kind of crap tools that if you adopt leather work will be replaced almost immediately. 
     Even if you decide you don't really like leather having a decent punch or awl in a drawer later can still be used for minor repairs and such and you don't have a bunch of extra stuff laying around that doesn't even work well.
     If you are in the US I would avoid Tandy stuff unless it was on sale. On Amazon Kyosen Elle, Owden, and Wuta are of decent quality to take you thru intermediate levels and projects.

Après un utilisateur, le fondateur, je te propose l'avis d'un média présent sur Groover ! 😛

Pour nous, Groover facilite énormément les choses. Nous avons tous les éléments réunis en un endroit (titre, bio et liens vers les réseaux sociaux) et ça va ainsi plus vite pour donner des retours et découvrir les artistes.

Je peux comprendre que certains retours soient parfois deceptif pour les artistes, mais des fois on ne ressent rien en écoutant le titre alors qu'il est tout à fait correct techniquement. Difficile alors d'en faire un retour...

Je profite de ton passage pour alimenter le sujet :)

De mon côté je suis ingé son, j’ai un studio de mixage et je bosse essentiellement avec des artistes auto produits (donc typiquement ceux qui viennent s’inscrire sur Groover).
Généralement ils s’enregistrent avec leur propre matos, ou font un passage en studio et je passe derrière pour faire en sorte que ça sonne comme ils le souhaitent.

C’est un boulot super sympa mais … ils sont difficiles a aller trouver, justement parce qu’ils sont auto produits (donc besoin d’aller les dénicher un par un). 

Est-ce que vous envisagez de permettre aux artistes de contacter des Mixeurs ou studio de mastering, avant de passer à la phase label / média ?
Un peu comme une étape sur le workflow (maquette -&gt; version enregistree -&gt; version mixée / master -&gt; label -&gt; médias)

Je ne suis pas fondateur de la boîte mais je suis un utilisateur confirmé de Groover, j'y ai fait plusieurs campagnes pour plusieurs centaines d'euros a chaque fois, j'ai passé des dizaines d'heures à bosser sur des campagnes donc je pense pouvoir répondre à toutes tes interrogations.

Groover n'est pas du tout une arnaque, c'est un outil tout à fait pertinent pour le promo de musique indé ou autoproduite MAIS il faut connaître certaines données et respecter certaines règles.

Commençons par les bons points : 
+ L'équipe de Groover est en général facilement contactable et réactive, ce qui est très appréciable
+ Le panel d'influenceurs / contacts pro est très large
+ Tu peux potentiellement atteindre et être en contact avec des médias ou des pros qui ne t'auraient jamais calculé sinon

- certains contacts peu consciencieux font des réponses copiées/collées impersonnelles
- certains contacts s'engagent à t'aider, ou te promettent moins et merveilles mais ne donnent pas suite
- certains influenceurs connus pratiquent des tarifs surcôtés

Pour les points négatifs,à chaque fois que j'en ai parlé à l'équipe de Groover ils ont été a l'écoute et souvent ils m'ont proposé des compensations.

Mon conseil : 
Surtout surtout, bien décortiquer chaque fiche de contact/media,/influenceur avant de l'ajouter dans ta campagne et ne surtout pas se précipiter ou s'enflammer.
De même bien préparer tous ses éléments promo (communiqué de presse, photos, cover, MP3, etc etc) AVANT de lancer la campagne.
Bien s'appliquer sur la rédaction de tous les éléments de la campagne.

Pour configurer une bonne campagne, je mets parfois plusieurs jours si on mets tout bout à bout.

Alors je vais être très biaisé car je suis le fondateur de Groover 😅 Mais je ne peux que te conseiller d'utiliser la plateforme, surtout en tant qu'artiste semi-pro.

Et on te garantit écoute et retour sous une semaine, ou alors tu récupères tes crédits pour en contacter d'autres.

&gt; Seven books have temporarily been held from circulation at Dearborn Public School libraries while the process for reviewing materials is revised, said Ross Groover, district consultant, at the board of education's Sep. 12 meeting. A district book review committee composed of parents, teachers, administrators and media specialists will review the titles and others in the Dearborn school libraries.

&gt; The titles removed were submitted by parents. They are:

 * ""Push,"" by Sapphire

 * ""The Lovely Bones,"" by Alice Sebold

 * ""Eleanor &amp; Park,"" by Rainbow Rowell

 * ""Red, White &amp; Royal Blue,"" by Casey McQuiston

 * ""And They Lived,"" by Steven Salvatore

 * ""All Boys Aren't Blue,"" by George M. Johnson

 * ""This Book is Gay,"" by Juno Dawson

&gt; Five of the books have been removed from the district's physical libraries while two were available as ebooks through an online catalog. **Since the district does not have the authority to regulate books in the catalog, they temporarily have removed student access to the entire online library.** [Emphasis - Editor]

&gt; Book bans have been increasing nationwide. The American Library Association reports more titles have been targeted for bans or restrictions so far in 2022 than in all of 2021. Books banned in the last year are typically about an LGBTQ+ protagonist or a protagonist of color, according to a report by PEN America, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting free expression.

&gt; The books that Dearborn public schools have removed follow the trend.

&gt; Information from the American Library Association on how to stop local book bans was distributed at the rally.

&gt; An hour after the rally in support of keeping books in the libraries, at about 2:30 p.m., a crowd that supported the ban held a rally at the main library. The ""Protect Our Children"" leaders brought three excerpts from the books under review. One display was from the book ""This is Gay,"" showing a naked boy, and another display illustrated a boy challenging another boy to ejaculate.

&gt; Dearborn joins four other school districts in Michigan that have banned or temporarily restricted access to books pending an investigation, according to PEN America's index of school book bans. As of June 2022, Gladwin Community Schools banned 34 titles, pending investigation, Hudsonville Public Schools banned ""Half of a Yellow Sun"" by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, in classrooms, Novi Community School District banned ""Lawn Boy"" by Jonathan Evison in libraries and Rochester Community Schools District banned five books, pending investigation.",,,,,,False,,False,,{},,,False,,False,t3_xo5lrl,,dark,False,/r/Detroit/comments/xo5lrl/dearborn_book_bans_draw_supporters_and_foes/ipyt6hx/,public,False,t1_ipyt6hx,,,[],1664198045.0,r/Detroit,0,,,,,,,groover,,,,,,,,1664985722.0

Plus, we specialize in production, not one-offs.  But what I stated above is not hard to calculate out.  You just need to identify your ""shop-rate.""  

Even if you used a pc of scrap material use a comparable cost from McMaster, plus the shipping.  Lets say $40 + $10S&amp;H  (you actually got enough material for 2 or 3 right?)

Not sure what tool you used to make that ""thread"" but I would use a carbide groover  I have in stock, and I'd charge for 1 insert/2 edges because I'm mitigating my risk.  So $40.  

You're doing it manual, so the programming is more like the reverse eng and the planning.  We'll call that 3hrs, plus the actual production- guessing 2 more hrs of dicking around here.  Lastly we'll say your garage shop rate is $65/hr.

Subtotal A: ($40 +$10+$40)x 1.25=$112.50

Subtotal B: 5hrs x $65= $325

So the price for 1 part is $437.50.  If they need two the total price is probably the same because as you can see most of the cost is set up and tooling, and the production portion is a well-padded timeline to cover contingencies. 

Storytime:  Years back I was helping a new customer with moving from prototype to production and they sent me their invoices from Protolabs in the package.

A few tips:

Your stitching looks a bit uneven.  This happens when hand saddle stitching and you lose track of the pattern.  If you make sure to alternate consistently, you'll get a much tidier look when you pull it taut.  A good way to keep track is to use visually different needles (you can use a lighter to burn the middle of one without damaging its point, just wipe it down after to remove residue) or knot one needle's thread longer than the other.

It also looks like your stitch lines wobble a bit.  There are two good ways to avoid this. One is to use a pricking iron with ""too many"" tines, and seat one or two of them in existing holes from the previous punch.  Another is to use a stitching groover to put a shallow channel in the surface, which will both help the thread sit more evenly and provide a guide for positioning the pricking irons.

Other than that, nice construction and clean cuts!",,,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_xf9s8e,,,False,/r/Leathercraft/comments/xf9s8e/couple_of_collars_i_finished_up_recently/iolh03c/,public,False,t1_iolh03c,,,[],1663283908.0,r/Leathercraft,0,,,,,,,groover,,,,,,,1599156010.0,1665043335.0

It's strategic. Let's look at Georgia's two runoffs for U.S. Senate: one in 2008 and one in 1992. In 2008, turnout between the general and runoff elections decreased by 43%. In 1992, turnout decreased by 44%.

There are plenty of historical facts to support the fact that run-offs are racially motivated because the man that introduced the run-off election style voting, Denmark Groover proudly admitted: ""I was a segregationist. I was a county unit man. But if you want to establish if I was racially prejudiced, I was. If you want to establish that some of my political activity was racially motivated, it was.”

And Cal Jillson, a professor at Southern Methodist University, told the Washington Post that most of the states that adopted runoff systems did it to “maintain white Democratic dominance of local politics. Letters and speeches that survive from the period show race was very much on the minds of those Democrats who advocated the primary-runoff process. “People had no misgivings about stating their real intentions and stating them in racial terms,” Jillson told the paper.


But how and why do whites benefit from run-offs? I'm glad you asked.

During a general election whites in Georgia tend to split their vote among many candidates and black people tend to split their vote to fewer than 2 candidates, but usually they fully back one candidate. 

The run-off gives white people a chance to come back and put all their votes behind the white Republican candidate. Add to this that black voters are not only discouraged from voting via mid-election voting roll purges, fewer open voting locations, inferior voting machines and more issues with the voting locations machinery and manpower, but are also least likely to be able to take off from work for a run-off election. 

2nd - Warnock didn't run against Purdue, he ran against Loeffler and in the special election he got 32% of the vote and she got 25.9. Warnock beat her in the run-off with 51% to her 49%.

3rd - John Osoff (D) ran against Perdue in the general election held in November with Osoff receiving 47.9% of the vote to Perdue's 49.7%. Osoff soundly beat Purdue in the run off with 50.6% to Osoff and 49.4% to Purdue.

There's no factual proof that Perdue would have won the race without a run-off because in Georgia, the general election is what all other states (except Louisiana) call a primary - again, due the DOZENS of candidates on the ballot. And the run-off is what all other states (except Louisiana) call the general election. 

Georgia simply threw an extra step in there to happen after the hype of the election was over and after most people are suffering from ""election hype burnout"" to give white people a chance to show a united front and to disenfranchise black voters.",,,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_xavecn,,,False,/r/Georgia/comments/xavecn/is_it_true_that_walker_a_guy_who_can_barely/io0g9nk/,public,False,t1_io0g9nk,,,[],1662917240.0,r/Georgia,0,,,,,,,groover,,,,,,,1586642672.0,1665068822.0

It looks like you’ve applied something to the flesh side/inside of the flap, and perhaps tried to burnish it. I’d recommend applying some Tokonole, but -not- burnishing it. Basically just reapplying it until it’s fully saturated and feels a little bit “plastic” like. Burnishing, or trying to burnish, something that’s going to be folded like this often leaves those wrinkles, as the burnishing tells the fibres to stiffen and be rigid, and then you next ask them to be flexible and fold. Remove the rigid/stiffen instruction, and you may be farther ahead. 

The second thing would be, as a previous commenter suggested, to thin out the part where the leather folds. Use a skiving knife to gently pare the leather down while it’s dry. Typically, to avoid a weird thin area if it looks awkward, I’ll create a VERY gentle slope down to the crease, and then keep skiving (carefully and evenly) to make the rest of the flap from that point on either the same thickness or a gradually decreasing thickness. This takes a bunch of practice though (and I still make piece-ruining mistakes sometimes). Another thing you can do is do a fairly sharp angle down on one side, then an opposite angle down about 1/8” away, and skive out the middle. A creaser or groover might help you here, too. Finally, spray the leather down until it’s shiny, let it absorb the water, fold it (a bone folder will help you get it just right), and then put something heavy on it (but ideally breathable too, if possible).",,,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_x9kwif,,,False,/r/Leathercraft/comments/x9kwif/first_leather_project_envelope_styled_pouch/ins547l/,public,False,t1_ins547l,,,[],1662760341.0,r/Leathercraft,0,,,,,,,groover,,,,,,,1612238883.0,1665079009.0

When you feel yourself wanting to rush, instead set the work down and walk away for 5 minutes. Seems counter productive, but it forms a good habit of not touching the tools with anything other than peace in your heart.

Assuming a saddle stitch; pay as much close attention as you can also then, to starting every stitch with your dominant hand, and placing the other needle into the hole either in front of or behind the first thread (but not both) and focus on doing it the same way every time. I find it helpful to gently hold the first thread along the stitch line, either forward or to the rear of direction of travel depending on which way I started.

They make a WORLD of difference in the final product.

I highly recommend trying out the others by the same author (Chandler Groover) - they're generally regarded as the community favourites and I agree wholeheartedly!

Also, Flint is amazing, but *if* you care about mechanical rewards from it you may want to look at those beforehand, of particular note:

When, during the story, you get a choice to &gt;!either play it safe, or raise the stakes, I recommend raising the stakes!&lt;. One reward is locked behind that - &gt;!a Dangerous increase of 2.5% of your base Dangerous that can go beyond stat caps, at the cost of a 20% decrease in your base Persuasive (which can of course be reclaimed given a little time farming)!&lt;. If you care about that, and don't mind waiting a long while to play it, I recommend &gt;!getting Dangerous to its cap of 230 (after doing the cap increase storyline of course) and making sure you're done with the Cave of the Nadir and other Dangerous-lowering stories/actions, as the increase from Flint does not increase the cap, only the actual level (so you cannot regain your overcapped level without playing Flint again). It is actually possible to play Flint over and over to increase your Dangerous more and more, and some mad (complimentary) person has done that, but that's absurdly expensive and not recommended. Of course, playing all the major stories with Dangerous decreases will take a long time, and there will forever be actions you'll have to dodge, or sometimes be unable to dodge if you want to complete a story (possibly including future stories or other Exceptional Stories)!&lt;, so I suggest not fretting over that and just to have fun!

(yes I know I just said not to fret over a chunky list of warnings, but it really isn't a very big deal, just trying to be thorough in case it helps someone)

A few questions and comments.  

What sort of paint were you using?  There are instances in the green that it looked pretty thick, and part of the face on the first picture was pretty far over the edge as well as thick and gloopy.  When I am using acrylic paint I tend to water it down a bit and do multiple passes to build up the color.

There are a few corners you did not connect with your line tool.  You may want to revisit them in a slow and deliberate nature to connect them up.

Also It looked like the stitch groover ran a bit a stray on the first image.  Wheew.. been there and suffered that before myself!

The first picture shows a sort of lip or raised up edge on the top and left.  I am not certain what that is for, but a bit of edge beveling and burnishing should help. 

The strap looks rough on the flesh side.  You can use the smooth side of a beveler and a bit of water to mat that all down in one direction.  Tokenole could be used as well.

I am not sure if it's the picture or way it was hanging, but the second picture shows the handle rivet part sort of wonky and not fully lined up.  That could be a bit too loose of a rivet or just a miss in eyeballing.

The lettering looks good for free handing it, but a good tip for the future would be to design out the letters first on paper. Use that, or transfer it them on tracing paper.  The tracing paper would help for a more consistent look.  Letters next to each other tend to stick out.

In the bleed-water scenario, the concrete is likely poured somewhat too wet and the jointer/groover tool is prematurely used when excessive bleed water is rising, combined with overworking the path, causing bleed water to be pushed into the top surface and 'dilute' the water/cement ratio there, which results in a very weak &amp; easily eroding surface.  


Another somewhat 'contradictory' cause, yet results in the same end result, regarding water being pushed into the surface is too late of use by the jointer/groover tool, when the concrete begins to set &amp; be less workable.  
In this scenario, many times the finisher will sprinkle a small amount of water in that jointing path, to work up more 'paste' for better workability.

Maybe a bit less if you can build out some of it yourself — but the nature of this question suggests OP doesn’t have a lot of experience so lets go with MSRP of $1400 (first google hit). Plus you need to devote space in your build and design around where the toilet will be — that also takes more $ and more effort to get right. You still have to deal with dumping it and storing and whatever; perhaps less so if you spend lots of money on the toilet.

In contrast lots of folks use “wag bags” (toilet kits in plastic bags) or DYI wag bags (buy the materials on amazon; or just go real low brow and shit in a Safeway bag) or if they really feel the need for a more normal toilet experience a portapotty. These work pretty well. Much of the time you can be near a gas station or coffee shop or trailhead pit toilet so many find they don’t actually use their toilet all the time every day. Rafters use a “groover”, basically just a bucket, with great success and if you’re in an area with lots of rafting you can also access their machines for cleaning out the groover. 

I’ve been doing weekend &amp; summer van trips for many years now. I’ve recently started working more from the road (thanks starlink) so we recently upgraded from at bucket/bag approach to a portapotty. Mostly as an experiment. Its small, easy to fit into our build, and provides a simple to use experience. When we’ve needed to use it its worked great and its completely simple to dump in a trailhead pit toilet. 

I could see building a fancier setup; but even then might just go look at cassette toilets that are a little easier to dump. Its really _not_ on my list of things to upgrade in the van. If money was a concern I wouldn’t even be thinking of it.

Side note: shitting in the woods is often suggested. We’ve moved away from this. Too many people can’t dig real holes, leave their TP out there, and generally make a mess of the world. I HATE those people with a passion. They deserve to die a horrid death by falling face first into a pit toilet. Although we’re  aware of these issues and know how to do it right (even have a good shovel in our kit) the high impact of so many people out trying to do van life &amp; covid driven camping and etc means I recommend a self-contained solution and stepped up my own build to align with my recommendations.",,,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_wmjbd4,,,False,/r/VanLife/comments/wmjbd4/van_build_budget/ijzz27p/,public,False,t1_ijzz27p,,,[],1660314565.0,r/VanLife,0,,,,,,,groover,,,,,,,1457636923.0,1662700982.0

On Submit hub, it's kind of snobbish. Some curators and influencers are good and are properly interested in hearing and sharing your song. But others, really just always say ""oh great song but it doesn't fit what I am looking for right now"".  It's 50/50 but if you have a good quality song (especially on the production side you should be able to find some success).

I also recommend using groover instead of submit hub it's a bit more expensive but curators are more professional and really enjoy discovering new music and connecting with new artists.
