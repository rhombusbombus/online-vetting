This last time was special, because I was able to go in the back and watch a bunch of nerds playing a bunch of instruments and singing a bunch of songs.  Like, \"l al alala lalalalal I'm singing! La la la al alalala!\"  Ya know, typical song-stuffs.They have beer.  This is good for drinking.  This is also good for making important decisions.People talk about acoustic stuff here and how good they are.  So there's that.  Okay. Cool.Bye!"

    "review": "Been here many times, and it seems that lots has changed since COVID. The comic book shop looks very empty with shelves up against the wall instead of forming aisles, cute seating on the border, and it's very spacious inside, whether this setup\u00a0is due to special events or due to the pandemic. The music hall in the back where the concerts are held looks more beautiful and inviting than I remember (or maybe it's just the person I was with that made me feel that way).\u00a0Lots of colorful lighting, great posters on the wall, plenty of seating (with just a few tables), and of course the tiki-themed decor everywhere. The food and drink offerings are limited here, but it's better than nothing.We visited this past weekend, and got to enjoy performances by\u00a0Tuz & The Sound and Social Justice Collective, talented musicians who were just extraordinary, poets performing beautifully with rhythms of different music on stage. The drummer was particularly outstanding, and\u00a0the artists on stage were all smiles and seemed to be having such a great time the entire night, which made\u00a0the perfect atmosphere for the crowd as well. The show ended around 10pm, so it was about 2 hours long. But you don't need to arrive at the start time, which made it convenient for us as we opted to take our time having dinner on a Saturday evening before attending.Art Boutiki\u00a0does live music the way it should be, with great sound quality and lighting, professional setup and equipment on stage, and no messy wires creating a distraction for audiences. And of course, great bands!\u00a0I did get a bit warm in there (it was a hot day in SJ), but they had the fans blowing, so it wasn't too bad."

A music venue in the back and a hidden away printing shop for all your t-shirt needs and shenanigans?!Probably the most versatile place ever. I've been a huge fan of this place since they were in downtown San Jose and I continue to love this place til this day. Its been awhile since I have been there (due to life complications) but I always recommend friends to check out music even if they are unfamiliar with the band. You won't be disappointed. Also -- the family who runs this business support local music which is a huge plus. They really do the SJ music scene a huge favor around here by showcasing fresh or seasoned talent without ego :)"

    "review": "Great small venue for listening to live music or performances.  We saw the Top Shelf Big Band there and the sound and lighting were wonderful.  Their website warns you that parking is not great, so we had UBER drop us at their door step, easy-peasy!  They had a decent selection of wine and beer.  They even have food, which they call small bites. No fresh fruits or vegetables were available as far as I know. You go up the bar to get your drinks and order food.  They give you a restaurant pager that lights up and jiggles to let you know when to pick up your food.  The food was served in paper plates, but it was a normal wine glass. Periodically, I gave the bar empty beer bottles, dirty napkins, dirty paper plates and dirty wine glasses. The seating includes about 10 dinner tables and various upholstered chairs behind that.  The music started at 7PM on a Sunday evening with a crowd of 50-60 people. Starting at 6PM would be even better for us as so many places start at 8PM or 9PM for music which is too late for us.  We bought the tickets on line for about $16.xx including an on line surcharge.  The food items and drinks were all under $10 each."

Seven comedians including the hostess five female, two male we are outstanding! I've been to shows that advertised to be far more legit than this and I am truly blown away for not only was it just me but the rest of the crowd truly laughed, howled, clapped, yelled for all of these comedians were just so professional! At the end of the show they announced they would be doing a comedy lineup like this monthly... Count me in! Please consider checking out this venue if you haven't yet add it to your list October 23 is their next gig... I'm sold!"

The front room is a comic shop that sells all sorts of books and shirts and trinkets and stuff. The back room with the stage has a bar that serves beer and wine. You can also order food from their limited menu.   I would love to give them 5 stars but they sell food and it's really bad. My wife ordered a chicken bowl and I never heard the end of it. The white rice was crunchy like it was cooked and reheated and her chicken was still frozen in the middle. Ugh, I didn't get any food but she was quite disturbed.    I think ultimately this is a killer music venue and all the other stuff is just a bonus. I say go to the taqueria across the street then come see the show. Rock'it!"

    "review": "SLG Art Boutiki & Gallery reminds me of mullet: business in the front, party in the back. The front part of Art Boutiki is a store, and the back part of Art Boutiki is a legit music venue.Art Boutiki's front store has a small selection of comics, statues, toys, pop culture art, clothing, and other miscellaneous items. I must say though that Art Boutiki isn't the kind of comic book store where I would go for my weekly comics pull. You'll mostly find trades. During nights when there are shows, this area becomes a great mingling space for bands and their fans since bands have their merch tables set up in this part of the establishment. So far I've been to Art Boutiki twice. I went to a show a few years ago to see a Seattle band called General Mojo's, and the latest show I saw was with the SJ local band, The Pounders. Art Boutiki's music venue is perfect for small, intimate performances. They do serve alcohol, but I believe only beer and wine. It's got a decent size general standing area, but there are lounge chairs and couches in the back. The sound and acoustics sound great at Art Boutiki. I like how Art Boutiki carries out the tiki theme. You'll find Polynesian art and tiki masks throughout the entire place. Even the bar at the corner of Art Boutiki's music venue is a small tiki bar stand."

They have an easy to see stage from all angles and it's decently lit. The ambience lends itself to an island feel - Art Boutiki, emphasis on the Tiki.They serve drinks of all kinds, coffee, tea, beer, and wine.Their beer is more on the IPA side, but still a couple other varieties. The wine is a bit short, just a few selections, but enough to appease.Their sound board is on point - never too loud and they are dialed quite well for the size of the room.You can preorder tickets usually online for a few bucks cheaper, walk ins are around 12 bucks for the night.Usually it's 2-3 groups for a total of 3-4 hours of play. Almost always worth the time.I'll keep going here and I always look forward to their events. An absolute gem of San Jose."

I've seen several locals play this venue and brought my Wife and teenage Son.A couple that's lived in San Jose has owned and operated the place for a long time and is highly respected by the bands and customers that frequent it.I've seen a lot of great local talent here.They serve alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages and an assortment of appetizer type dishes. Pizza, chicken fingers, that sort of thing.The only con is that it's in an area where the zoning goes from commercial to residential so they tend to close around midnight. They are also in a part of town that honestly looked a little sketchy to me but I've never had any problems."

First off, the venue:The place itself has a deliciously cool warehouse feel - without the terrible acoustics. The stage was impressively setup and for once, the soundboard was in the back, where competent sound guys were manning the board. The staff:Extremely friendly staff, utterly lacking the smug hipsterism too often seen at other venues and events. They were genuinely glad to help their customers and treated me - and the rest of the musician rabble - very well. The open mic:This was, hands down and by far, the coolest open mic that I've been to, and I've visited from Dallas to Detroit to LA, to everywhere in between.  Why?It was perfectly eclectic. Although there was a hip-hop overtone, ALL were warmly received. I played an acoustic set. I was followed by numerous comedians, rappers, and a couple of monologues. The environment was one of community and not competition - a sentiment felt and experienced at most other open mics that I've been to. In short, in a single evening, this place earned my respect and my business."

You save like two bucks for pre-buying. Plus the pre-buy setup is old-fashioned. They email a bunch of people, and you're on a list. I love it.The crowning glory on this occasion was they were looping a Killer Klowns from Outer Space DVD on the small TV on mute above the bar. In between sets and at other times, I found myself unable not to watch. It's scary even though it's not even though it's terrifying. Like utterly bone-chilling. The special effects suck, and they mostly sucked in 1988 as well. The decapitation part is the least scary part of the entire film. But the slow, silent chases! Give me more."

We left the venue early because we were both super uncomfortable and walked to my friends car that was broken into (back window was broken.) if I could go back in time and told my friend not to go I would. The crowd was bizzare and bumping into other people without saying sorry is the norm."

    "review": "Growing up, I always imagined Bottom of the Hill (BOTH) as a sort of mecca for punk rock in San Francisco, similar to, but nowhere near the level of importance or acclaim as Gilman on the other side of the Bay (but what even is?).All my favorite bands would play here when they were in town, but since I was in LA I would get to see them when they came to SoCal. Yet I always had the desire to visit here one day. Well that day came recently when I was able to see one of my favs from back in the day, Sicko, play a show here along with locals Mr. T Experience and the Pathogens.I don't really know what I had drawn up in my teenage mind when I first heard about this place many years ago, but like most things we imagine when we are that young, they usually don't meet up to our lofty expectations. For whatever reason, I had imagined BOTH to be a large club, similar to maybe the Troubadour or the Whiskey in LA..however it is actually a lot smaller and more intimate than the majority of the rock clubs in Hollywood. For those from LA, it's closer in size to the Echo or the Smell.On this night, the place was decorated in a Halloween theme since we were close to the holiday, which I was delighted to see. There were also past show posters framed alongside the walls which highlight the rich history of the club. If you walk towards the back there is a tiny room which was set up to sell merch.They do have a bar, but I'm sober so can't say much about that other than they do have alcohol.Tickets can be bought onsite or reserved through their website. There is will call out front where the guy basically just checks your ID to make sure it matches the person who bought the ticket online. If you're over 21, they put a wristband on your hand and if not, well I guess they don't. It is all ages though because I saw a bunch of kids inside. There is no coat check here but leave your jackets at home since it gets pretty warm indoors.The sound was good and the crowd was fun, mostly nice and not too intense on the night I went.Parking seems limited, with street level parking and a small lot out back. I took a lyft so it didn't affect me one way or the other.Overall, it was a fulfilling experience and the teenage me would be so excited that I got to go here. Heck, the current me was also excited about it too!"

The sight lines are not great as the ceiling is low and the stage itself is small and also not too high. If you are at the front to the right of the stage, you end up blocking the walkway which means people walking into you. The venue is small/intimate with lots of character but the surrounding area is a little shady. At least the ticket prices are reasonable. I may not be back unless it is an artist I am dying to see."

The place is cash only but they have an ATM by their front door. The bathrooms were interesting: women's restroom has 2 small stalls but the door to the bathroom was left open so people on the main floor could look into the bathroom. I didn't really like this but maybe they do this as a safety precaution? All in all a great show and venue :)"

The interior of this place hasn't changed much in the past twenty years. A tiny stage, abstract art on the walls, and small bar in the front, which gets pretty crowded. They have a nice patio area in back, perfect if you're a smoker; if not, they do have some nice vegetation to admire. The place isn't near any muni or BART stations. This venue is tiny and there's no real room to move around or dance. The place is cool for a first concert experience but can be a bit annoying if you want to try to enjoy a show."

Once for an incredible 60s/70s themed wedding with an amazing David Bowie cover band, and once for a show with a band featuring men dressed like orcs from Lord Of The Rings and the headliner, a heavy metal Arnold Schwarzenegger parody militia style band that played songs about the movie Junior, Twins, Kindergarten Cop, and more.Needless to say, Bottom of the Hill has A LOT to offer. It's cash only and you'll need to check online to see what show may be going on as ticket prices/cover can vary greatly. The drinks are extremely affordable and the bartenders are so so so kind and do a great job of seeing everyone who may be in need of a drink and/or safety earplugs and servicing them stat. The venue isn't huge but I think that's kind of perfect for a show where you don't want to get crammed in and pushed around. There's a back room that I've spent about 20 seconds in but I think it's a good area to hang in if you order from their small kitchen menu. There's also a back outdoor patio with some limited seating, tons of gorgeous plants, and a pack of adorable kittens that do not want to be pet."

However, since they were only two of them, I figured it might not still be an issue. I was wrong. It's really insulting that they have warnings about break-ins posted as a small flyers on the window, because that shows they see and KNOW there's an issue, but their only solution is \"check your bags with us for free!\"Listen, if I thought they couldn't afford some security or at least a parking area to patrol, I might be more sympathetic. But with what their drink prices were, and that it's cash-only, I know they have enough. It's simply ridiculous. Don't even go to this place. The fact that people keep returning despite these issues is just not giving them any incentive to fix anything. Now I'm out $1300 in belongings and my car has a permanent breeze. Cool. It happened to a few cars in the area it seems, too. One car was missing a gas cap after. So they will literally f*ck your sh*t up just to do it. To end on a positive: Sound system was nice inside the venue. It was a nightmare navigating to the restroom though and the lack of seating was weird.

    "review": "For the most part, I would give this place a 1 star; however, there were a few redeeming factors of this place: The sound and acoustics were good, the merch table was easily accessible, the bar is. . simple, and the headliner selection is incredible. On paper, this should be an excellent venue. Heck, they even let the artists play their full setlists, and each artist with the exception of the headliner started on the minute and promptly. There's even a warning sign talking about people leaving valuables in their cars. Thoughtful if you ask me.Now, that was the good, but what boils down is this: Just how responsible are these people? I can predict that they say that they are responsible for nothing unless something illegal happens here-then they just don't want to be on the short end of the stick. That's the problem here: They're in it for themselves with greed, and their attitudes show it. The door opening time for last Thursday's (it's Saturday morning now) show was 8:30 while the show was supposed to start at 9--1 headliner and two opening acts. As each opening act played for almost an hour, the artist that I'm sure we all came to see did not take the stage until 11 PM, and had a setlist that was twice as long as the others. It apparently was scheduled for the headliner to perform at that time, but I had no idea that was the case until I was there. I took public transportation to get myself to the venue. I was driving from Vacaville to the El Cerrito Plaza BART station and got off right at 16th and Mission station. Now, this venue is not the closest to the 16th and Mission station, but then again, it's not the farthest (about a 20-25 minute walk) and it isn't that far from some of the SF Peninsula's precise bus stops. Problem is, when the main event begins at 11:00 PM, don't expect it to end before midnight (or better yet 11:30 so we can have time to catch the last couple of East Bay stops at BART). Now in some ways, that's just the icing of the non-tasty cake. In line in front of me, an older gentleman and the older middle aged man who greeted said a quick \"hi\" to one another. After the the older gentleman in front of me asked the greeter how he was doing in a genuine manner, he said something among the lines of \"I want you all to bring your ID cards out so we can match your names.\" The greeter's vibe and insensitivity was very curt and off-putting for me. He then asked me specifically if he could see my ID as if I was underaged. I've been working in the professional industry for some years now, don't look like I'm under 21 anymore, and haven't been carded at all in recent memory except when people must card everybody just for the sake of policy--so I was carded twice. That too was unpleasant. Also, when I was in the venue and looking on the website, I couldn't help but remind myself just how narcissistic this venue is: From a long list of every performer who played in there from 1997 to present day, to the in house staff using a professional camera with flash taking constant pictures of the performance likely for that same purpose.So to conclude this review, if the event started two hours earlier, I wouldn't have to debate which I wanted to do more: Go home safely and at an affordable price or see the full show of the headliner that I bought the ticket to see in the first place. As I really didn't want to miss the main artist's 20ish song set, I had faith that I could just walk fast enough and catch the 800 all nighter route AC Transit bus between South Van Ness and Market by a few minutes after 1:00 AM when the event ended about 15 minutes after midnight. Unfortunately since it's my first time trying to take that late bus and ever going to this venue, not only did I miss the BART's last departure but also this bus by apparently a few minutes, and just to learn that the next bus wouldn't come till at least an hour or so later. So to avoid panicking, uncertainty, and being worried, I just shelled out a pretty penny I didn't account for on an Uber to take me back to the El Cerrito Plaza station. Wow could that all have been prevented had it started and ended earlier. Considering all of these vehicle break ins I hear about, public transit is the wiser choice in SF and throughout this district, and if they don't start the events and end them at earlier times, I simply cannot justify going to a show out here again. That plus the rude vibes and narcissism they all seem to be emanating, unfortunately it is not acceptable to be a part of all of this or see another performer here until lots of that stuff (especially the times) get better. Thanks for reading my experience here."

There's a good amount of street parking, but we got there a little early so it was probably easier then to find things. It can get pretty hot, but it was sold out so that's pretty standard. I didn't have anything from the kitchen but there is a full bar. It's a cool little space, really eclectic. If your band is coming you should really go, the tickets are cheap and it's a small venue so you're up close and personal with them. My only complaint is the bathroom. It's pretty small and it's a gender-neutral which is not a problem, but there's two urinals and one stall bathroom. When I went in it stank like old pee. Besides that, it's a cool little place."

Check-in was a breeze - show your ID at the door and then once more to the guy with the tickets. Since I pre-bought my ticket ahead of time, my name was on the list and I was inside within a minute. Inside is intimate and cozy and the acoustics were really good. Behind the stage area, there's a place with some tables where the bands were selling merchandise.Bartenders were really friendly and I especially appreciated that they held my bag for me behind the bar. For free! Bar is cash only. There's plenty of street parking nearby but I chose to Lyft there and back. Would definitely come back!"

It was a rock show so we had to rent a bunch of equipment from another local vendor who dropped everything off before our arrival. No issues with the handoff and we had everything we expected. The sound engineer was on top of his game and knew what he was doing, no hiccups throughout the night. The space is pretty flexible, enough for a small show (maybe 80-90 people fit comfortably in front of the stage) but plenty of overflow room towards the back if you really want to pack the house. In addition to the bar you can get a few food items from their small kitchen, not sure if our guests took advantage but it was a nice option. We'll be back!"

The auto break-ins are a serious problem and you're simply at a much greater risk for being vandalized at this venue compared to other venues in the Bay Area.  The venue hasn't exactly ignored the problem, and offers to check your bags, etc., but they're also not really pro-active about taking some sort of more concerted effort to protect their patrons. It's a tricky situation for them for sure, but given the extraordinary circumstances of the neighborhood it would seem to be in their best interest to try *something* besides a simple sign posted in the window warning you about the problem.However, once inside, the venue is homey and a good place to see small indie bands. The cash bar is totally a thing."

Seriously, the commute from Sac to this venue couldn't be more ideal. We didn't have to deal with downtown traffic at all. The venue itself is small with a fun, funky vibe. I think capacity is under 300, so it was truly an intimate concert experience. There were some technical sound issues between the opening bands which put things behind a bit, but I thought Bottom of the Hill did a great job trouble shooting and getting them resolved asap. I also really appreciated on a personal note that the bar tender was extremely pleasant about giving me free water on multiple occasions as I was not ordering drinks. Overall this was a great concert experience... Dare I say likely more fantastical than what the goers of the Metallica show down the road experienced? I would definitely not hesitate to go see another concert here."

When I say intimate, it indicates that it's a smaller crowd because it's not a huge place.If you know you possibly have super funny dance moves you might bust out with after you get some drinks in you, just know that everyone is going to be watching you hahaha (fine by me, I find it entertaining) You know the dance moves where you wonder if they have any sense of rhythm at all and question why they're throwing their arms everywhere in air as if their arms are jello lolThe night we came, a hip-hop Swedish band was playing and although I didn't understand anything the whole night, I still managed to have a good time!

    "review": "One of my more favorite venues in SF. It's kinda famous and it is easy to see why.I've seen plenty of bands here. It's so small and usually I hate small places that get too packed, but because of how 'shallow' the standing area is, I'm usually able to actually WATCH the bands that are playing, even when another 6'3\" BRO SHOULDER takes up that last cubic foot of space I had in front of me.I come here for the bands and don't think I've ever gotten a drink here, but other people appear to have them all the time.The one thing I dread about commuting to SF (from Sacramento) for some live music is the whole 'find a place to park your car' thing. Suffice to say, there's a generous residential area where I've been able to find parking pretty much every time with little to no drama, even with sold out shows. It's pretty much always in-out with this area which is good news if you're coming into the city. Just be prepared for the never-ending construction on the Bay Bridge on your way out. Bottom Of The Hill typically ends their shows around 1AM (I think they ended one ONCE at like 12:30 when I was there). If you can deal with that, you're golden.Just don't leave anything valuable anywhere visible in your car."

From Arcade Fire to Mike Park to True Widow, if you are on the way up, chances are you're going to play here when you come through San Francisco.It's a dive. And that's a major part of the venue's charm. It's also tiny, but that just means there isn't a bad view in the house. If you're feeling crowded you can step out to the back patio and still be able to hear and see the show through the window. Oh yeah, and bring cash. That part is important. You gotta bring cash."

    "review": "This is my FAVORITE venue. Period. I have been visiting this venue for nearly 9 years now (still do even though I live in Sacramento now) and I'm sorry it has taken me so long to write this review guys! This place hosts an array of artists both big and small, which is honestly a treat, like an ice cream dipped in chocolate and then dipped in more chocolate kind of treat. The place is big enough to pull in a crowd, but small enough to feel intimate. You can actually see the band perform from almost every angle and feel like you're a part of something. BOTH stays down to earth by making shows accessible to all ages and keeping ticket prices reasonable. The people are usually awesome whether it be the crowd or the people that work there because we're always there for the same thing. THE MUSIC. The acoustics are solid, which is probably the most important thing. If you can't hear the music or if it isn't fine-tuned, then what's the point, am I right? It does have a dive bar-esque feel, but it's definitely open and clean and has a cute little patio in the back to breathe. First tip: bring CASH if you want to drink. Second tip: Be prepared to be awkwardly intimate with people in the bathroom. It's usually clean, but they fit 2 stalls and a sink in what I feel could be a bedroom closet. I just wanted to say that this place makes me happy and I hope you get a chance to check it out for yourself :)"

    "review": "The Appearance:While the outside of the venue may not have the greatest curb appeal, the inside certainly packs a punch. The main floor is decorated with vibrant posters for upcoming shows and calendars displaying the rich history of bands that stepped foot on stage. The dim lighting almost gives the vibe of a jazzy night club you would see in the movies. Just beyond the stage is a nook for bands to put their merch on display and get in touch with the fans. Outside the double doors is a patio to get fresh air or have a cig. The patio has some size to it, but if it is a sold out show the patio can become quickly congested. Especially in between bands when everyone is sweated up from moving around on the main floor. The Bar:The bar is fairly proportioned to the size of the venue. The staff is very friendly and seems to enjoy what they do. Service is very quick and drink prices seem to be below average for the San Francisco area. The Experience:The size of the main floor is absolutely perfect. It is big enough to pack in a sizable crowd, but small enough to provide an intimate musical experience. Anywhere you stand seems to provide a great view. You wont have to worry about a pole or crazy fixture blocking your vision. The sound is always crisp and never overpowering (something that may occur in a tight venue). I cannot recall an instance where the volume was too loud. The area closest to the stage tends to be a place for those who want to dance/ skank/ rage (depending on the music). It allows those who want a place to move around some room, while providing those who don't, space to watch comfortably. There may be moments things get tight, but overall it is a very chill venue to see a show.For Bands:The first major drawback is the lack of storage space for instrument cases. The majority of them needed to be stacked against the wall near the merch area. Not that anyone would ever mess around with your stuff, but these days you never really know. Members do receive a free drink which helps to get the night started. The sound guy is extremely professional and takes the time to do the job right. This includes taping down cords, adjusting mics, and other minor details some venues over look. The sound guy proactively adjusts the levels to ensure your sound is the very best. This is a venue that takes shows very seriously. The payoff is always a great time with plenty of memories. The Verdict:Highly recommend you give this venue a shot, whether you are an artist or an audience member. Can't wait to play my next show there. June 2016 cannot come soon enough!"

Grab some dinner at either location, then head over to this bar for good music in a relaxing setting.We came here on for the 10th anniversary of Mae's Everglow tour. The bar is cash only but there is an ATM machine. The layout of the bar incorporated a bunch of themes that somehow works when all thrown together--i.e. Christmas lights, skulls on the wall, and potted plants. It makes you feel like you've found an intimate, cozy hipster bar that was too hipster to judge you because you discovered their new hangout spot.There are tables in the back where people had their Macbooks set up. The window treatment is also interesting, reminding me of a house straight from a Dr. Seuss book. The patio area is relaxing as well. There is a staircase but it leads to storage space. No one seems to know that so occasionally you'll see people walking upstairs, thinking they're heading to a cool spot. But then they just come back in a few minutes because there's nothing there."

The bar only accepts cash, likewise cash payment for the entry fee if any. They do have an ATM just next to the entrance if you didnt carry cash.Though the place appear kind of old and rundown, the sound system was good. The bar carries the typical alcoholic drink and a limited list of beers. Drinks are cheap, beers were at $6/bottle. Tried to request for Mojito but they do not have any mint. So ended up with two Strongbow cider which worked out well too. Two girls next to us ask for their \"special shots\" listed on the wall, the bartender whispered to them that he got no clue what it was. Thought it was pretty hilarious, apparently he was just stepping in before the real bartender comes in. The streets were pretty dark by the time we got there, it appears to be located in the midst of an industrial area. Ideal for a music venue so there wouldn't have much sound/music limit restrictions. There are plenty of parking along the streets so that's great for those who drive. It's also a short distant from the 22nd Caltrain."

It's small and charming, stuck in a random spot in the city, and if not for the huge blue sign they've got blazing up the front of the building, it'd be nearly forgotten. But, it's my favorite music venue in the city because of the intimacy you get with being so close to the musicians, and with the great sound they have here.Just to show my concert cred, I've been here for Seeking Empire twice, Asobi Seksu, and the Colourist. Every band I've seen here has been incredible, and I've been literally footsteps away from them performing. It is the best sounding venue I've been to in the city. Everything just feels crisp, and loud as well. Feel like I need ear plugs sometimes when I'm here, but that's a good thing right?The venue itself is small, but not small enough to feel claustrophobic. They've also got a nice little patio right behind the stage that you can go out and grab some fresh air or a smoke. Their bar is pretty stocked, and they've got all your typical favorite beers on tap. It's rare that a venue will sway me into going to a concert, but Bottom of the Hill has that unique effect on me!

Inside, it is exactly how a rock and roll club should look. Lots of cool lighting and posters all over the place, and the acoustics are excellent. The front part of the club is the main floor, stage, and bar, and there's a nice little lounge with a fireplace in back and a Patio just outside the lounge for smoking. Some reviews said there were no ins and outs, but when I asked if I could go put something in the car they had no problem with it. The staff was great, and when I requested some reserve seating at the bar because my wife is on crutches and can't stand for long periods of time, they were very helpful and accommodating (Thanks Lynn for hooking us up!).The bar is cash only, but not terribly expensive at all. The Liquor assortment is pretty standard and there are no specialty cocktails, but the ladies behind the bar were willing to make anything I requested as long as they had the ingredients on hand to make it. The place is so small that band members can be found hanging out before and after their set, so I got to meet Kam from Chain Gang (super cool dude), and it was just a very chill, laid back place. I think my only complaint was that they opened kind of late (doors 8:30, first band at 9:00), so with 3 bands playing and a cutoff at midnight, it felt kind of rushed. I would have liked to have gotten a longer set out of Chain Gang, but they did awesome with the hour (barely) that they had. I think if they had just opened an hour earlier it would have been perfect. Some people also said in their reviews that the bands played way too loud, but I didn't think the noise levels were excessive. All 3 bands sounded good, but none of them were painfully loud, but always a good idea to bring some earplugs anyway. All in all, had a great night and looking forward to going back!"

Bathrooms are on the small side, but at least they are functional.  You can order some nice greasy spoon food through a window past the bar.  Lots of outdoor parking around the area, my fiance' loves that about this venue, making it his favorite SF music venue for small concerts.Be sure to bring some ear plugs, they like to rock out the speakers here.  Which is cool, because you can feel the music through your body, however, your hearing is replaceable.  Felt like the crowd is pretty chill.  Oh and bonus, along the sides there are seats if you're luck enough to grab one."

Located at the bottom of Potrero Hill (hence the name), Bottom of the Hill is up there with Rickshaw Stop. Staff is friendly, sound is always great. I've never been disappointed with this venue. The sound quality here is always A+. They put their all into giving the crowd, and band a great experience.Love the outdoor courtyard/smoking area. Decor is great, and always a friendly vibe no matter what genre of music you came here for. I've been backstage here with my friends who were headlining a few months ago, and it was pretty cool. The backstage area is up the stairs located in the courtyard. Good security/bouncers, good drinks, okay food.I highly recommend coming to Bottom of the Hill if in the area, and catch a show. It never fails, and It's nothing like The Chapel (horrible, pretentious venue)."

But that place was at a level that was hard to stand, even for me. I had planned to stay all night, but I left early due to the excess volumeOther than that, it is worth the visit.

There's a small stage & everyone piles up wherever there's a little space to stand.  But makes seeing such great artists in these venues all the richer in experience & worth the attendanceParking was easy to come by & bartenders were easy to recognize we needed refills - thanks for the imbibing attention!Just missed seeing the Proclaimers but am definitely keeping my eyes out for the next chance to come back to Bottom of the Hill!"

I will add that I've been on both sides of the stage, as performer and as an audience member, and it's been a good time any which way. The staff are friendly and the drinks are strong. I am way more inclined to see a show if it's at BOTH than just about anywhere else in the city."

Luckily the rest of our experience was great - we had an awesome turnout, played with cool bands, had good sound on stage, and we played pretty well.When I went to watch my friend play, I brought my DSLR to shoot video footage.  The sound engineer, Paul Thomas, was fantastic!  He gave me a line out of the sound board and a line from a room mic, so I could get some good audio.  The sound in the room was awesome, and my friends say the sound on stage was top notch as well.The overall experience was 4 stars, but Paul Thomas pushes the review up to a 5. He was knowledgable, professional, friendly, and he went out of his way to make sure the night was as good as possible."

Be sure to bring a jacket or have a Lyft coming to get you so that you're not roundhouse kicking everyone else out of the way for flippant taxi drivers who accidentally wander out that far.  Other than that, over-priced drinks (as expected with any venue), cool patio in the back to smoke in (and you can still see the back of the stage and hear the music), and a bunch of creepy old masks and seemingly ceramic heads that line the top of the bar- you aren't tripping they're actually truly there.  Just an old, funky spot that is really quite intimate to see a performance at."

    "review": "A visiting friend wanted to see a show, any show in town so I randomly picked this place as it was cheap and I had heard it was a pretty cool place. And boy was everyone and my random brain right about this place!It is a bar/restaurant, and they do all ages and 21+ shows. My friend being of that annoying almost-but-not-quite-yet age, we went to an all ages show and it was surprisingly not overpopulated with teenagers. They've got a front room with the bar itself and a few tables and chairs which widens out to the low stage, where you as the audience can get up close and personal with the artists if you so choose. Bathrooms are just past the kitchen (a long window in which you order their decent sized food menu from) and as the night goes on, get grosser and smellier. Following the stinky bathroom corridor is another room with more chairs, tables, a fireplace (not lit during my visit), and doors leading to their outdoor patio for smokers or lovers of the fresh air, which also has some seating. I enjoyed going to the back room and relaxing but still enjoying the music.This place is cash only, bar and food, and while they do have an ATM it charges you $2.95 for each withdrawal so I recommend bringing some cash along.Drinks are pretty average, slightly overpriced bar drinks. My first drink was kinda yuck (but that is more my taste, I decided to try a new drink and it had ginger beer in it and apparently I do not like ginger beer) and my second drink (that I knew I liked) was good, but crazy strong, I couldn't finish it because I wanted to be able to drive home later. I got a quesadilla to sober up and it was perhaps the best quesadilla I've ever had. But I was drunk, so everything probably tasted delicious.The bands: I saw Young the Moon, The Districts, Big Tree, and Guy Fox. All some pretty bomb dignity indie bands whom I greatly enjoyed. All of the bands mingled with the crowds before and after their set, so it was great to be able to interact with them and tell them how much we loved their tunes. This place seems to book a lot of local bands, and in my book that is always good to support. Definitely come back here again for a good time, for bands I know and will get to know!"

The sound is super loud, I always wear earplugs, other than that, shows are on average $12, there isn't really a bad place to stand since it's so small, drinks are cheap. I use to come here when I was under 21, I still think they offer shows for all ages, I've never experienced a bad crowd as far as I can remember, again I think this is due to it being a smaller venue - feels almost like an awesome house party..... trekking it out to Potrero though is a trek! There aren't cabs readily available and the muni doesn't run very frequently by the time you're out but if you work your app magic this isn't a big problem."

AND their website shows), an announcement was made that they were closing.  My two friends went to the restroom, and N and I waited for them where we had all been standing.  When they started ushering people out, I was going to find them to tell them we needed to get going, and one of the waitresses (older, scraggly blonde, hat) condescendingly said, \"oh, you need to move this way, sweetie ... \" pushing me to the exit.  I told her I was looking for two friends I had been waiting for, to which she responded, \"oh, okay, well ... I guarantee they'll get out, so you need to go this way,\" and proceeded to try to push us out the door.  RUDE. One friend came out of the restroom (I also had her wristlet which she inadvertently left on the counter - probably because she thought we'd be there waiting for her), and she wanted to wait for our last friend in the restroom (her GF).  Same scraggly haired lady emerged from the kitchen and tried to tell her, \"Yeah, you need to move THIS way, Sweetie,\" to which my friend replied, \"Well, my girlfriend's in the bathroom and I'm going to wait until she gets out!\"  Scraggles, shocked, says, \"WELL, I guess you just made a statement!\" and went off somewhere else.After a cover charge and *hours* of drinks, these people act like complete idiotic jerks to their patrons.  I will NEVER come here again and will also be sure to tell everyone I know not to patronize this place.

The crowd is young and cool and way hip, so you get to feel younger by proxy. There are like 5 chairs total in the whole place, but if you are geriatrically inclined like me, you could easily grab one because all the cool young urbanite indie lovers are standing to watch the show. It's kind of a culture shock for me to see a room full of people strictly on their feet, standing still or slightly bobbing their heads to the music."

They have some extra \"breathing room\" in the back with plenty of seating to eat, drink, or have a chat -- you can still hear the music, but can't see the stage from there.  They also have a little outside patio -- popular with the smokers, so I don't use it much, but it's nice that it's there.My favorite things about this place are the kitschy 60's B-movie/beatnik vibe (hard to describe... sort of a Lost in Space meets Kerouac meets Beetlejuice kind of decor), the offering of local and indie/underground bands (sometimes very popular in their own right, though -- Black Moth Super Rainbow and School of Seven Bells, for example), and the low prices (tix about $8-15 usually -- no crazy Ticketmaster style \"service fees\" for advanced purchase, just a couple bucks extra), with reasonable drinks but cash-only bar. I like perusing their calendar and in any given month I can always find a new up-and-coming or under-the-radar band I dig. (The most recent ones being United Ghosts and Foxtail Somersault)Oh yeah, and I drive into the city regardless of where I go, so easy-breezy parking right outside the front door is a major bonus in my book."

And since alt-J was pretty popular, definitely had more people than expected. But basically heres the run down.1.) Alt-J and Wildcat! Wildcat! were both good and really enjoyed it.2.) The place was not extremely huge and they definitely dont pack it in beyond capacity. Much appreciated.3.) Got a great view of the band and could hear everything.4.)

This place doesn't accept credit cards, and the ATM has a surcharge of $2.35 or something to withdrawal money.Lastly, I'm not sure if it's the neighborhood or the people I met were just unlucky, but a poor family came out after the show to find that their SUV had been broken into.  On a general note, make sure to not leave any bags visible in your car or someone might want to steal it, thinking that there's something valuable in it."

Beer prices aren't bad. 6 bucks is the most expensive beer they have, which is reasonable. I do however, wish there was snacks of some sort. Other then that, a great place for a small show!"

They did some stuff from their new album and as a bonus to end the night they did their rendition of \"The Monster Mash.\"The bar was really good too, the drinks are good and the snacks they have are actually food that is edible which is very rare in a bar, the \"Bottom of the Hill Nachos\" I highly recommend, it is made with fresh cheese and is spiced so you can taste the black beans and the other ingredients that are sprinkled over it and it is EDIBLE!!!! The only drawback is that it is kinda out there away from everything but if you want a really nice night at a bar that actually does rock hard and has a nice eclectic space go check it out!"

I love the grungy, industrial vibe outside, the EASY parking, and the casualness of the whole area. Inside, they have good beer for cheap-ish prices, an easy-going bar tender, GREAT acoustics, and pretty cool under-the-radar bands. We saw Cold Eskimo (who KILLED IT - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kqFB_ssjBk). It was packed, but enough room to still step back, get yourself another beer, chat with the bands . . . Overall, I would say the whole place has a very friendly vibe, and I would really recommend you check out a show there."

I'm not a fan of the cash bar (despite the readily available ATM adjacent to the bar) but the sound there was GREAT. A well organized space with a really cool back patio as well.The food wasn't half bad either. I ate the thai noodle curry stir fry whatever with chicken and it wasn't bad. It seemed like that dish anywhere else would exclude the noodles in the curry but whatever - it tasted fine.Clearly this isn't a place you'd just wander in (unless you were either in the area or on an expansive, walkabout-esque bender) so you're going to go here because the band you want to see is playing here - BUT if there's ever a moment where you're not sure it's worth the trek, definitely check this place out. Of the many cool venues in San Fran, this is one of the best."

In some ways this place makes me laugh because it seems like that dump from an 80's movie where some band plays only to have the scene end in mayhem with it getting trashed.  The bathrooms are pretty nasty but easy to get to.  There's a neat smoking patio if that is your thing and a back \"chill\" area though mostly this is where bands hock merch.  The bar offers nothing fancy in terms of beer but thankfully keeps it decent at $4-5 a pint.Probably the only bad part is that this is a relative \"dead zone\" when it comes to cabs and unless you bail early, you'll be fighting your fellow music watchers for a precious ride home.

There is usually easy parking in this neighborhood, which is an added bonus.  The place itself is usually pretty cold and dark, but they have a nice back lounge area with a fireplace and a bench.  There's also a back patio which is great because it has a high window from the back of the stage.  You can hear the muffled sound and usually see the drummer a little bit.  The bathrooms could use some work, but it's not surprising compared to the place.  They also serve food here which is great because there's nothing around.  I've never ordered from there, but the menu sounds pretty good for bar food.  They showcase a lot of local talent (and some un-talent), which always makes for a good time.  At the last concert I went to, the sound guys seemed to be having a hard time getting the band's monitors right, and the mic even shocked one of the singers.  It came across that we probably weren't getting the ideal sound setup, and I wondered if that's par for the hill.I will always enjoy coming to this place every so often for a fun night out!"

Hated having to get off the 22 and walk two blocks in the dark in an otherwise deserted part of Potrero Hill (And calling up the bro for a ride back home), but had a pretty wild and fun time all-around!If there's one good thing about this venue being surrounded by not much else, it's the fact that the incredible loudness it produces can't bother neighboring residents and businesses. The acoustics are amazing! The interior of the place is gorgeous and roomy, including a very swanky-looking stage. Our little group jumped around, headbanged, and made that dance floor our bitch. There's a good amount of bar stool seating and some booths and couches in the back to eat, drink, and converse and if you just want to listen to the music away from the main area - also a fireplace to warm up on those cool nights! The smoking area right next door to the booths provides even more liveliness, as if there wouldn't be enough magic going on inside.The staff is very friendly, and the bartenders make their drinks pretty strong. Or maybe that's just my lightweight talking! But they were definitely helpful in loosening me up for the evening. ;)Great crowd, great venue, great music!

There's a  cool patio outside if you want to  relax or have a conversation. You have to remember that the ambience is kind of random -- the bands who play really attract a specific kind of audience, but you will be surprised in a good way.Typically there's a cover of $8 - 15, but it also depends on the artists who are performing.  It doesn't get too busy, but again this all depends on the show.

Make sure to pay the bartender a buck to get some.  Lounging is in the back and the very back is the smoking area.  They have this stairway outside that goes up to the rooftop for additional partying, however, its exclusive so I have yet to venture up there.  Make sure to say hi to the local Bottom of the Hill kitty in the smoking area, and pray that he/she doesn't get lung cancer.  Street parking is readily available, and its away from the downtown madness, so its low key and ideal.

I had to stop enjoying my drinks after the second round and was grateful that they replenished the complimentary water as often as they did. The bathroom left much to be desired but it's not like I really go out of my way to watch bands in places with pristine bathrooms. The stall doors closed (sort of), there was plenty of TP, and the toilets flushed- so it was adequate.

I even took a screen shot of the order page for good measure.However, when I showed up at the venue I was told I was not on the will call list and that I couldn't get in. I showed both the door man and the manager my booking number, and showed them the screen shot. But it was to no avail. I was told that their online ordering was a \"foolproof\" system and that I should have checked my credit card statement to confirm that the tickets were purchased.After checking my statement it did turn out that I had NO tickets, despite what I was led to believe on the website. Shame on me! Clearly their website not so foolproof, but since it's the bartender's pet project she's awfully defensive of it!My beef is that it's uncharacteristic for a web site to imply that you've booked your tickets without being billed, and that the bartender was so unsympathetic and uncompromising to a loyal customer.To Bottom of the Hill: fix your \"foolproof\" website, and I'll fix this review."

On one occasion one bar tender took my order and someone else gave me the wrong beer. It was in the same price range and it was also a beer I liked so I didn't mind or complain, but it wasn't the one I asked for. The patio is lovely, but there isn't much seating. The stage and the live music is always good though and if you look on the wall a lot of really impressive acts have played here. I really enjoy myself here."

A lot of small band coming through this place on their way to bigger and better things, and a lot of bands come that you discover that you would otherwise have never heard before. The venue is intimate, small, cozy, and you can go over and give the band members a high five right afterwards. In terms of the other parts of the venue: the drinks are decent (they have guinness on tap, which always makes my day), and the staff are friendly, and the crowd is always fun and not usually too douchey. (I'm also completing this review just so I can mark the shiny new \"hipster\" checkbox that yelp has now)The only downsides are that the the sound system could be (a lot) better. One band I went to see had a female vocalist, who was completely blown out by the sound system. As a bonus, from the vantage point of on top of the hill that this venue is on the bottom of of, the stage is beneath ground level, therefore, you can check out bands while they're still, literally, underground"

The place can maybe hold 150-200 tops. It is narrow and super personal so if your favorite band is playing there you are are in luck because even if you are in the back you are still \"close\". They have a small outdoor patio that you can go hang out on and there are table ledges on the walls for your to pony up a seat and eat. The people that work there are cool and parking is not an issue. Even if you don't know the band, if you have a free night i'd suggest buying a ticket (they are generally really cheap) and going for the atmosphere. That's what I did and I had a blast!Definitely will keep this place in mind when planning for upcoming evenings out."

Don't let the location fool you, this place is amazing. They get great bands and the sound quality is pretty impressive for such a small venue. Crowds never get crazy or mosh-y at the shows here; you'll have plenty of wiggle room. They have Anchor Steam and Pyramid on tap. Worries = none. There's also a patio out back if you need some air. They have food that I haven't gotten to try yet. Don't know too much about that. It's very comparable to the Troubadour in L.A.Parking is unbelievably easy, too."

I haven't been back since, but I enjoyed it so much I had to review it now that I use yelp religiously.I'm not going to lie, when my friends and I first drove up to the venue, we were like \"THIS is it?\" We were there about an hour before will call opened, and it didn't look as if anyone was around or in the venue. So we just waited until we saw other civilization to get out and get in line. Parking is also weird. Hopefully you can find some on the street near the venue, but you probably have to get there significantly earlier than the show itself.When we entered, I was surprised at how narrow the standing room was. Scared that I wouldn't be able to see the performances, lo and behold I was right at the front even though I hadn't been the first in line.I was afraid the sound system would suck, given that I was right in front of the speaker. It turned out to be just fine, and the sound quality was pretty good. Maybe it was just the artist herself, but set up did take a long time and we all got pretty anxious.My friend got a beer and I think it was reasonably priced. After the show we hung around and no one seemed to mind. Overall, it's a nice place for shows and I'm glad Kate Nash performed at this location. I look forward to seeing more bands here soon."

Decent venue for a local show, I'm pretty short and was able to see the band from a few different spots.  I was also able to chit chat with my friends over the volume, that's a plus.  So there's a legend I heard about-- the glass in back of the stage--many performers have tried to break it but they can't, it's solid ROCK...I've also heard that there are magical unicorns and cotton candy.I could be biased about this place because I was seeing my fave band live for the first time, but I'd definitely return for a different show.  Can't beat $12, and it's got some charm.  Crowd is chill, hipsters n such.   Bar n food.  Oh, and parking is easy if you drive.PS. Website tix are kinda tricky, thought I'd purchased and got a confirmation number, but my card was not charged and I didn't show up on the list so I had to buy em at the door.  Cool place.

If I get the hall pass on that one, rest assured one of the first items I'll work on is seeing more live music at Bottom of the Hill.There's a litany of reasons why I strive for more face time at this legendary Potrero Hill music venue, and for ease of reading (or maybe a carefully constructed mirage to mask the fact that I'm afflicted with a mild case of the bottle flu this morning and not feeling overly creative at the moment), I'll supply a short but steady list of why it's one of the greatest places in town to see art in motion:1. It's such a warm room with fantastic acoustics. Most definitely one of the best sounding venues in SF with a continually stellar line up of both local and national acts. 2. It's super easily accessible via the 22 or 10 Muni lines (sure there's more I'm missing as well).3. Some of the cheapest drinks that you'll find in a live concert venue. $3.50 for PBR on draft and other American staples in the bottle. 4. They have an awesome staff who never seem to wake up on the wrong side of the bed before coming into work.5. A great patio for having a smoke break (if that's how you roll), or just getting some fresh air if you're not feeling some artsy fartsy, shoe gazer opening act.6. They have some pretty damn good food as well! Even a few vegetarian options by way of veggie burgers, veggie hot dogs, hummus plates, and a gourmet option of grilled purple potato tacos marinated in their al pastor spicy broth (obviously before being drenched atop a pile of swine). Heck, you might even ask if it's vegan, as it very well might be if you exclude the sour cream and cheese that comes along with it.I'm sure there are way, way more notables to add in the future, but really - if this doesn't convince someone to want to stop what they're doing to take a peek at their concert calendar, they're better off just staying at home."

And the venue is so tiny that the intimacy of the place is pretty amazing, you could just waltz up to the \"stage\" and shake the hand of band members you've admired for years. Not to mention some awesome shows have been played here. I'm just even thinking of recently: forgetters, the get up kids, rx bandits, ted leo, murder by death, max bemis, street eaters. They've got ska nights and a bunch of awesome local bands, not to mention the bigger names that seem to drop by more than once in a blue moon.

The patio out back is also a great addition to this place as it can get a little stuffy and sweaty (as expected with other venues and not nearly as bad as Thee Parkside).The tickets are usually between $10-$20 and this is more than a fair price to see a great live band in the heart of the Potrero district."

There's also ins and outs for those 21+. There is a cozy smoking patio out back which is nice on summer nights. The sound system is very hit or miss. Sometimes it sounds awful, distorted and way too loud, and other times, I have no problem with it. I love shooting photos of bands here. The lighting is excellent, and it's easy to get close to the stage. I usually stand by steps leading to the stage and I always get great shots here.I also love the Sunday BBQ shows here. They're cheap and they feed you as you catch the show! A long time ago, I caught Alkaline Trio playing a BBQ show here on my birthday!

I've seen my friends' band in lots of places, but felt compelled to review this one.  I LOVED this place from the moment I walked in the door!  Great layout, lighting dim enough so as to not blind you but not so dark you can't see where the heck you're going.  I had just been picked up at the airport and needed to change, so I made my way out the side door to the courtyard to head upstairs to the dressing room.  Had to have someone carry my suitcase up the stairs, but that was the only negative of the entire night.  I was concerned about maneuvering the steps back down once I was wearing heels, but they were safe!Great service at the bar, nice strong drinks, good prices.....  Even though I managed to spend like $100! (yeah, I got kinda tipsy - but I was on vacation and not driving!)Whoever mixes the sound for this venue does a GREAT job!  It doesn't look like it's an easy room to mix, and he did fantastic!  All 3 bands sounded great (but I am biased and partial to the headlining Dave Rude Band that night :) )  I liked that you could stand almost anywhere out front of the house and see well.  If you want a break, you can go out in the courtyard or have a seat in the back and actually carry on a conversation without shouting.  All in all, a great experience here.

Surface level stuff: They get great bands to play here, ticket prices are reasonable, parking is sketchy, venue is small and intimate.The sound, however, is awful. I've been here twice: once for the Polysics and once for Kate Nash. I understand that the Polysics are all about distortion and noise. I get that. That's why I came back to see Kate Nash. When the Polysics and Kate Nash have the same sound quality, something is up.The music was deafeningly loud. Unrestrained, distorted, impossible to enjoy without earplugs (which I definitely prefer to go without at most places, but here it was necessary).  I had a seriously difficult time convincing myself to go see Kate Nash at the Warfield, but I'm glad I did because everything there was fabulous. The problem wasn't Kate Nash, it was Bottom of the Hill. How can a concert venue get away with sound this horrible?I will not be coming back.

I applaud them for booking as many shows here as they do, even if some are not of the quality I would attend. I love seeing pop-punk bands here because it creates a small atmosphere that lets you share the night with the band you're seeing. You're almost certain to meet the members (unless they spend the whole night upstairs), but for the most part they have to walk through people in order to play the show, so if you wanted to, and if they were willing, it's easy to talk to someone here, although it's typically pretty loud.The sound here is okay, not the best, but definitely up there for the type of place it is. The stage is a good height and I'd be surprised if there's one person in the whole place who can't see what's going on. Not the best on parking, and my friend once got her car broken into while parked for a show there, but for the most part it's best to get a spot on that street, in front of the venue, because if you're parked down an alley, those are the sketch areas."

When she asked why he just took her money, he said \"what money\".  When she persisted he shrugged and took $5.00 out of the register and just laid it down in front of her and walked off.  Then when she got her drink, she took a sip and while she was putting her change in her pocket, the same dude cleared the bar again and poof - her drink was gone.  Again, she asked what the hell he was doing and he said, just clearing the bar.  When my other friend was at the bar to order drinks, same dude bartender skimmed him on his change.  When my friend called him on it, the bar manager came over and defended skimmer dude.  When my friend didn't drop it, bar manager tossed my friend out of the bar.   Bottom line for Bottom of the Hill, DON'T leave your money on the bar, because the bartenders assume all is fair game.   Be aware of what money you're giving them and count your change and finally DON'T leave your drink on the bar.  I think that these guys are counting on the patrons either being too drunk or too high to notice that they're being fleeced.  I didn't see anyone else mention this in all of the other reviews, but after the show, when word got around about my two friend's experience, other people piped up that they thought the same thing had happened to them, but that they must have been mistaken.  Too bad.  Pretty sweet deal for the bartenders, not so much for the patrons or the owners of Bottom of the Hill."

    "review": "A place where you can go to a punk rock show and actually have reasonably priced, decent-to-good mixed drinks?! Yes! And that's only one of the reasons why I love you so much, Bottom of the Hill.Seriously, this is my favorite venue in the city, with thee Parkside coming in second now that Annie's Social Club is closed. Bottom of the Hill is nearly perfect. You can have good drinks if you're not a beer/shot person, there's a smoking patio so you never have to leave the venue (good for those under 21, who aren't allowed ins & outs), the ventilation is good, parking is super easy, it's easy to drive to, fairly easy to bus to (but not so easy to bus away from late at night), the people who work here are amiable (one of 'em sang \"Let it Be\" this one time I was wearing a Beatles shirt), all sorts of good bands play here for usually less than $20, and the sound is decent.I've been to over two dozen shows here - probably a hell of a lot more than that - and even when the bands sucked, I still enjoyed myself, which might have something to do with the fact that the bartenders can mix decent drinks, unlike other places where I've been to shows. There was a good deal of confusion the first time I got up the nerve to ask for an AMF here, which was a few years ago, but with a little discussion, they got it right. I've since realized that it's probably not the best idea to drink a toxic-looking, aquamarine concoction while seeing, say, the Dwarves or No Use For a Name or something, since at least a quarter of it will end up sloshed onto my person when it gets rowdy, but it's nice to know that you can have one, right?Oh, and if you're not planning on getting a tasty, albeit usually greasy, snack at the venue, definitely eat beforehand so that you don't end up down the street at the Connecticut Yankee like every other schmuck who goes to Bottom of the Hill with an empty stomach, and then ends up having an absurdly named (who wants to say \"I'd like the pee-wee herman\" when they could say \"I'll have a pulled pork sandwich\"?), mediocre meal at a sports bar."

The doors didn't open until 8:30p so be prepared to stand outside in the cold for a bit if you are early. Once the doors opened you will need to show  your ID and get a bracelet if you want drinks. You also get the ever-so-fancy hand stamp even though a sign said \"No ins/outs\". The decor was filled with kitschy random items along with a cityscape fun house like design. I love these types of places! They have so much more character. They also have a kitchen if you choose to partake in the bar food. There is even seating in the back area past the stage. Drinks were reasonable and the people were pretty easy going. No complaints there. I would definitely go back for future concerts."

Those that like a lot of space while watching a show will not find joy in coming to this venue. It is SMALL and the people are packed in like sardines. When we entered there was literally people over flowing in to the entrance. We had to side step and get all Matrix-like to get in to the heart of the crowd. I didn't mind that so much as it gave the place a very (very) cozy feel but if I had a choice, I'd definitely opt for some more breathing room. Along with that, because it's so small you really feel as if you're apart of the show; you get to experience the band in a way that you wouldn't in a huge arena. It's a trek from where I live but worth it if there's somebody you're excited to see!"

Since I was seventeen I've been frequenting this place. Seen hundreds of shows here from Elliott Smith to the Murder City Devils and certainly drank a ton. And, for a venue, the drinks are fairly priced, liberally liquored, the service fast. The atrium is great for us smokers, I always run into someone I haven't seen for years, and the graffiti in the bathroom is above par.

The huge downside of this club for me is how crowded it gets. I'm 5 foot 2 so if I want to see the band I need to stand near the front or to the side of the stage. If you stand to the side people will pretty much constantly walk past you and/or bump into you. The plus side is the food. I was pretty stoked the first time I went to be able to order a hummus plate. As a hungry vegan I wasn't expecting to find something I could eat on their menu. I wanted food the second time I went but they didn't have the food window open. Sad. As for the music - the sound is good and the venue does a really good job of keeping the lag time in between bands to a minimum. I really appreciated that."

Places just don't seem to have the staying power they used to, but BOTH has been doing something right for a LONG time and I hope they are here for twenty more years at least! They have become an institution. I've seen so many amazing shows here, I don't even know where to begin. Most notable, to me, was the last Guitar Wolf show in the Bay Area before Billy died and one of the last Bay Area performances by Morphine (1991 or 1992, I think) before Mark Sandman died. Those performances will stay with me always. Billy even gave me his bass pick which I keep in a special place on my night stand. RIP, Billy, you are missed. Man, what other shows have I seen here? Polkacide, Dead Hensons, Thee Coachwhips, Polysics, Acid Mothers Temple, Three Day Stubble, Lord Loves a Working Man, The Billy Nayer Show, Faun Fables, Mermen, El Vez, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, this list goes on and on. They know how to book good music, that's for damn sure! The ticket prices are always reasonable, the drinks aren't too over-priced with a good selection of beer/liquor, they have food to coat your drinking belly, and they have a nice back area to smoke in. My only complaint is the tiny ass bathroom. Two stalls for the entire ladies room. It can be quite the back-up in there on busy nights and it is here that I came up with my brilliant idea of Depends for music fans but they would be called something cheesy like 'Rockers!'. Don't want to miss your favorite band's next set but have to piss like a racehorse? You don't have to brave the hour-long wait for the bathroom any longer...with \"ROCKERS!\" Ahhhh...Okay, it started as a joke but don't act like you haven't thought about this, too. BOTH is one of my favorite venues to see live music in the city. I have had a few problems with drunken douchebags who don't know how to act in public and who flail their elbows around wildly without care to the craniums of those around them that they land upon, but a return elbow in the gut and a fierce look usually works. Back the fuck off, I'm an old school punk bitch and will TAKE YOU DOWN. I'd give them five stars except for the drunken idiot factor. They don't really seem to deal with people acting like jerks and ruining everyone else's good time very well. But still, BOTH is a great place to see music and I highly recommend you visit them if you haven't already. Oh, yeah, the staff has never had any attitude in any way in all my years of being a patron. That, unfortunately, seems to be rare in music clubs these days."

I was actually surprised that there are many places like this left in San Francisco, but they assured me that they were still able to keep going despite the high costs that had driven out most of the creative people that made the music and art scene great. Most of the good music has moved out to the East Bay, particularly Oakland, so it's nice to know that Portrero Hill still has the fire going.It's a nice, spacious place, with food (but I didn't actually eat that night) and a great bar. I love the bartender's handlebar moustache.

If you get bored with the show, you can go to the bar and mingle and it doesn't seem weird/rude.  Granted, I wouldn't suggest doing keg stands or anything like that because you do want to respect the artist(s) that are performing.  Parking is really easy to find within a couple blocks and the place is reasonably priced for drinks/shows.This place is also great for shows because it is small enough that the bands hang around and drink with fans/friends.  The bartenders are really good at getting to everybody in a timely fashion.  I never had to wait more than 2 minutes at the bar.  Most places I go to, I find that you have to go to the one foot space at the bar where the bartender serves.  Here, they notice the people who are waiting regardless of where they are positioned.  That sounds weird, but its true!The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because it is so far away from everything.  If you are coming from the freeway, it is close, but if you live in the actual city, it seems soooooooo far!  It is also really quiet there at night and kind of industrial looking so I suggest meeting friends beforehand and riding together.

The most exciting time to see a band is right when they're on the verge of breaking out and becoming well known. Bottom of the Hill is a smallish venue that aims to book lots of bands, many local, while they're still on their way up.The result is usually an intimate show, with bands that enjoy performing and want to make a name for themselves and a crowd that's more involved with seeking out new artists and live shows.The setup here is pretty sweet as well. I could pick out each instrument in a 6 piece band without even trying, and there's a sizable lounge and back porch where you can spy on how far along the set rotation is.The people who work here are totally sweet also. Here's an example: after last night's show ended there was a dude out cold on the sidewalk around the corner. The door guy happened to notice and immediately began to fret over taking care of the poor dude and getting him inside and taken care of, in spite of the fact that the show ran late and everyone was trying to close up and this was no small passed out dude.I've seen: Battlehooch w/ Judgment Day, Gliss w/ Morning Ater Girls,Fuck Buttons, and These Arms are Snakes here.Great bands, small space, excellent acoustics, clever setup, cool crowd, employees that nurse you back to health, good times!"

My girlfriend and I had to push and shove just to get to a different part of the floor, then a group of drunk people were yelling at me and my girlfriend all night. Regardless of those lame guys (which we saw there again the next night), I felt that it was so crowded that in a fire, I would probably get trampled before reaching an exit, and I'm not usually a claustrophobic guy. Although we didn't know the bands, I had heard \"of\" a couple of them. This place is said to get a lot of good bands. It was a fun place full of people from 21-35.

(Gone are the days of taking MUNI an hour each way to see a show on a work night!)I went here the other night to see The Slits and was reminded of why I like this place.  The venue is intimate, but not too small.  (Although, I've been at sold out shows where it DID feel small when I was being crushed against a wall.)  The bar has a good selection of beers on tap and there's a kitchen if you feel like ordering food.  I also love the decor...posters from old shows on the walls and holiday lights all around.Best of all is that there's ample street parking, so you're not going to have to circle for a half hour.  If you don't have a car and have to rely on MUNI to get around, the 22 Fillmore stops just a block away on (across from the Connecticut Yankee).As always, I wish there were more barstools, but I'll have to settle for getting to shows early to nab a spot to park my rear end for at least part of the evening...."

    "review": "Bottom of the Hill is the best music venue I've been to in San Francisco since I moved here a little over two years ago.  I try my best to go to around two shows a month so I can safely say I've seen a good amount of what San Francisco has to offer.  I saw Jens Lekman here a few months ago and it was one of the best shows I've seen in a long time. True, Jens Lekman never disappoints, but it's the intimacy of this venue that is its strongest point. Even if you come late to the show and find yourself in what would be the back row behind the tallest dude in the place, you're still close to the stage (and closer to the bar).  I'm not sure of the capacity, but it can't be anything over 200/250, which makes for a cozy collective. Besides the main bar area, there is a great space in the back in the back if you're just hanging out, along with a medium-sized patio for those Potrero Hill sulky evenings.An experience at a music venue can definitely depend on who the act is so its difficult to gauge the venue from night to night.  For instance, Jens Lekman, an adorable-Swedish-native-chamber-pop-charmer's show will be a lot different than say, the Everytime I Die show.  But I look at it for what it's worth: Bottom of the Hill is a classic, small, divey joint that's all about music, be it big names to the virtually unknown, jingle-jangle to supersonic boom.  So if you're going to see the likes of GWAR, well, prepare to be pushed around a bit.Oh, and the beer is cold and cheap and delicious."

The Entrance Band was pretty good too except these two stupid bitches pushed their way to the front and started dancing like maniacs and stinking up the ENTIRE venue with their horrendous B.O. Everyone had to back away from them and we all kept making WTF? faces at each other. Some chick yelled at them which didn't seem to faze them at all. Elbows were thrown, bf almost got in fight. NO SECURITY GUARDS. Then later a gigantic beast of a woman punches my bf straight in the eye and again, NO SECURITY. WTF. We left shortly after. HAVE FUN GETTING KNIFED HERE."

It's the perfect size to enjoy a mid-level band in an intimate setting, and the staff have always been very nice.I was inspired to write this review when on Saturday, 10.24, I wanted nothing more than to see The Mummies play. When I checked the website at 5pm, ticket status had gone from \"100 available at the door\" to \"some available at the door\" after the events people came through and grabbed a bunch. When I called and asked the bartender about this she was nice and explained the situation, and also gave me a heads-up that there were already 40 people waiting outside (2.5 hours before doors). Finally she let me know that The Mummies were also playing down the street at Thee Parkside, which directly let to me actually getting to see them that night.10.24.09 female bartender, you rule."

Drinks were reasonable priced, food was very inexpensive, no lines for the restrooms, and surprisingly excellent acoustics.  I'd love to go again.One potentially major drawback:  getting a cab in this part of town at midnight can be a Herculean effort.  Well worth it for the music though."

    "review": "The Bottom of the Hill in San Francisco is a staple of the club scene in the Bay area. It doesn't quite have the history of the Gilman, but in falling just short of that, it has a great reputation all its own. It's probably one of the 5 coolest clubs around and being tiny as all hell that means a lot. You can see everything from a Girlfriend Experience show to the latest Airborne Toxic Event show. Lots of bands make a pass through the city still being relatively unknown and when they sell this place out they sometimes are forced to play larger venues just to fit more fans inside. But, when you want an intimate show featuring your favorite band the Bottom of the Hill will surely be the spot to look. Whether you're searching through Myspace music or just going directly to the Bottom of the Hill website, you're sure to find at least one thing you'll want to go to each month. So go down to the water and park around the corner and get your hand stamped to enter this dark little club with good beer and music galore. CHAD"

I've never had to wait long for entry, a drink,or the restroom which is a major bonus. No one wants to be spending time waiting in line for something when they could be watch a show. When a show becomes too rowdy you can find refuge the outdoor patio or seating area behind the stage. If you love the intimate setting of small venue - this is your place. Parking around the venue is abundant which I find to be an added bonus."

The woman who ran the list/tickets was hostile and rude.You could tell by the look on her face upon entering that she was not a happy camper and as the situation elevated, her looks were not deceiving. When two different publications' writers should be on the list (email confirmations to prove it) and they're not, and you respond by being rude and abrasive, I call bullshit.I was shocked by how we were treated and it killed my night. After relaying my story to others, I found a couple of them had similar stories involving their list incompetency. I will still come here if I want to see a show, but I think cutting a couple of their staff (i.e. disgruntled ticket girl with short dark hair and anger issues) would do the venue some good."

I have a friend who has brown skin and was physically assaulted (sucker punched, broken glass on my friend's head- the whole nine yards)  by a white woman this past weekend at Bottom of the Hill after asking the woman to stop pushing into her. In response, my friend was yelled at by the bar staff and treated like she not only didn't belong, but that she had no business complaining.  My friend had witnesses.  She asked for the police to be called.  But the staff, including the bouncer, dismissed her outright and all but told her to leave.

    "review": "I haven't eaten or drank alcohol here (still rocking that underage ID), but that doesn't change the fact that BOTH holds an awesome show. I saw a concert here, and it was mega sweet. It wasn't like a regular show, where you're kind of far away from the stage, and the band is behind-the-scenes all the time except when they're onstage...it's more like you're hanging out with your friends who happen to be playing music there. I talked to my favorite musicians, danced with them, saw them eat dinner at the table next to me, etc. The stage is small, and pretty low, so you feel a closer connection with the band. Everyone there was very friendly, and I enjoyed myself. (And only $12 at the door for my ticket!)There's a smoking patio, seating for dining, bar, plus the area in front of the stage for dancing and general mingling. Slight downside: the bathroom is tinyyy. I think it was only one stall (maybe two), and barely room for the sink. So if you feel like you'll have to use the restroom at some point and see that there isn't a line, take the advantage and go then. It'll save you the pain of a long, drunken line later when you REALLY have to go.The only problem I had was that it did get kind of overly loud, because it's such a small area, but it was still great and entirely worth it."

I heart the bartenders, they've helped me by stashing my jacket in the back since they are coat check-less. My boy Shefik just rocked a show here last night actually, and boy did he rock it hard. Not in a head banging mullet kind of way mind you, but again in a hip scenester way (matter of fact he's a Yelp newbie, go send love shefik.yelp.com, he'll love you long time, I told him Yelpers spread the love..) He's played here before and I'm sure he will again, and I much prefer he play here over Rickshaw, and Rickshaw is like right by my house. Speaks volumes when I'd rather take a 20 minute bus ride to B.O.T.H. over walking 5 minutes to Rickshaw.They've got tacos, booze, tons of beer, a chill patio... so good. As far as music venues around the city go, and we all know there are gobs of them, this is one of my favorites. Mostly because it just makes me feel so damn cool."

Music was too loud for the space (at the risk of sounding like an old person), and sound design left something to be desired.  (They're not all metal bands, folks...)  But it wasn't bad.

And I got asked out by a drummer who not only had a large gap between his teeth, but also forgot he had a girlfriend. These may not be the most ideal things that can happen at a music venue, but they are definitely interesting. Live music is always a plus, and I'm always supportive for the SF music scene. So if you're looking for a good time--a laugh, a smile or even something worth blogging about--reserve your next ticket at Bottom of the Hill.

It is so far from any other source of entertainment, so isolated in its own loneliness, that  the feeling of \"yeah, I am coming here for a reason, it is not that I am wandering around Marina and choosing a random place\" can not be higher.  Then, inside, the crowd is relaxed, the sound is great, the drinks are good and fairly priced (not great selection on beer, though) and there is food.The restroom is a cool piece of art in itself. Sooo ... pick your band (there should be something for your in their calendar) and let's rock at the Bottom of the Hill."

The patio outside creates a nice area where you can step away from the loud music and chat. The acoustics in the place are outstanding:  they manage to maintain a good strong powerful sound you can feel in your chest without deliberately raising the volume to ear-piercing levels.  And a mandatory shout out to the band I came to see:  Kinch!"

    "review": "I was invited here by a friend and had no idea what to expect, but left more than satisfied and slightly hearing impaired. The Bottom of the Hill had a very relaxed and laid back atmosphere which I like. It doesn't have all that much seating except for in the back, but you can't see the stage. My friends and I hung out in the back and had a couple of beers and then headed out front when the second opening band came on stage. It was nice to hang out in the back because we had space to move and some of the band members were hanging out back there too. Once we moved out front it was shoulder to shoulder. I definitely liked that the bar was fast. We never had to wait more than a couple of minutes to order. Bottom of the Hill also had drinks in every price range starting at $3 for a beer. I really enjoyed both of the opening bands that played the night that I went, but the sound was off with the main band that played. The mixture between the instruments and vocals with the opening bands was really good, but the instruments in the main band were so loud that I couldn't hear what they were singing and it was killer on the ears. All in all this place was pretty cool and I enjoyed the music. The calendar on the website lists the bands that are playing and the cover charge for that night. Definitely check this place out if you like live bands. Warning: Bottom of the Hill is definitely in the middle of no where, but you can still catch a taxi."

Great for getting super-to-kinda close to the musicians themselves, not as spectacular when someone annoying is smooshing into you and you're losing ground quickly.

Also some random couches laying around at the back of the stage, a good place to rest up and chat with your friends.

I didn't understand a word of the singer, but love the two ladies on stage!!!Then the second act, I saw that night, the drummer was so cool too!!! He was totally awesome! His name was Colin.

So left the jazz bar we were at and headed out to Nowhereville, SF aka Bottom of the Hill around 11pm and had NO issue finding parking.  That is a nice thing.The guy at the front checking i.d.'s was bitter about something or other... and the crowd was a bit awkward too.  But I was all about the small, grungy feel of the place.  Limbeck was playing their \"Delicacy of Living Modestly\" stuff and it was real good.  Despite the weird San Franciscans (no offense) and obscure location, the venue is pretty okay.

One time I went there for a show and did not know who the bands were.  My husband and I wanted to play pool, but it was taken. We noticed there was a girl sleeping on the lounge, which took us space to have a seat.  Later, that same girl on the lounge sofa was in the band, 'The Lovermakers' started to perform on stage. It's like this every time. I guess that's what makes it cool.Other bands I've seen here are: The Mayfire, Scissors for lefty, Von Iva, and more.  Crowd is mixed and casual.

Nice small place where you can really see the bands play and not just see a sea of the back's of people's heads most of the time. I usually go when there's a good post-rock band playing but there are occasional metal bands as well.  No matter what bands I've seen, the crowds are always pretty diverse from my experience (no certain \"scenes\" or whatever dominating the place) and you meet interesting people. Sometimes they'll have some neat publications around, which I read while the next band is setting up. I like how they have self-serving water, you could get dehydrated at shows sometimes (I wish more venues/clubs did this!). Parking is rarely a problem in this part of the city (another plus!). I just noticed for the first time last night that there were a whole bunch of Jesus and Mary stuff when you look up near the ceiling, not sure how long those have been there, I never expected to see that ever so it gives the place a weird charm.  One last note, I'd recommend buying your tickets online asap if a popular band is playing an all ages shows or else you'll be one of those annoying beggars asking everyone in line if they got an extra ticket."

It's super intimate, they've got a great outside smoking patio which tends to get very crowded.My advice, if you are coming to a show here, show up early, grab some food in the neighborhood. Your best bets for reasonably priced / fast/ delicious food would be Goat Hill Pizza or Eliza's. The upside to GHP is that you can get slices to go and eat them as you walk down the hill to the venue.Last but not least, come here for shows of bands you don't even know, sit at the bar and talk with the people that work there, they've got great stories if you can catch them when it's not too busy.This place has lot's of SF history"

The drinks are pretty cheap and the bartenders are always nice and generous with the drinks. The patio in the back is great for relaxing with friends and sitting out some of those bands you might not be into while waiting for the ones you are into.

If you're in a band, however, the backstage is actually just a tiny room upstairs with a couch,  bathroom, and a fridge with some cold beers in it."

On around 11:00pm.\" [Inner thoughts: My pretend mental curfew is 10:00pm on school nights.]\"Wednesday night. Guest list.\"[Oh, well, I might try and bring a friend if I can get them out of bed.]A week goes by...I went.\"Hi, ID? Okay, $10 please.\"[I should be on the guest list.]\"Who's list?\"[Friend's list.]\"Okay and who's your plus one?\"[She is. Inner thoughts: YEAH, friend rocks.]\"Okay, thanks.\"[Thanks. Inner thoughts: YEAH!]It was a decent show, I think it was a little more mellow than I had thought it would be. Can't even dance to music that mellow. The vocals were great and the band was cool. The band before them was cool too and they were all caravaning together on their tour.Great patio, but only because it was pretty empty. I'm anti-crowd.Decent sized medium venue, no air flow, too hot. There is lots of parking around here and it doesn't feel like a good area because it's pretty dark and mostly industrial. I definitely recommend driving or taxing home at least. People are around outside nearby bars, but our cars were fine. We felt pretty secure."

And if things get too crowded, there's a little patio area in back where you can chill and grab a quick smoke... very nice.The only problem is this place is somewhat in the middle of nowhere. No public transport nearby, so you're either taxiing it or someone's DD for the night."

Doesn't have that grimy, dirty, little hole in the wall feeling even though its kind of on the small side in terms of the main floor, but that doesn't take away from the music and atmosphere. Everything just melds together decoratively. The acoustics is great. The speaker system is up to par in terms of straight up blasting.The neighborhood its in feels very safe. Its kind of in an industrial area so there's not too much around in terms of city folk. Only locals and the fellow fans of the bands playing that night. So I felt safe parking my car outside.Smoking area is in the back and to the left, which leads to an outside area. Rad thing about that is that the outside area is where the main dressing room is for the artists. I was lucky enough to meet the guitarists for Fall of Troy, and Foxy Shazam. Along with the pianist for Foxy Shazam who is a total character himself on stage and in person with his crazy looking beard.Overall, this is a great venue.  Will come here again for another show for sure!"

When they realized that we had 2 more tickets, and weren't going to use them, they set us up to sell our tickets to some of the kids freezing outside. The show was sold out, and some kids had been waiting all day. I got to make some kids' day, and they paid for my drinks at the show. We were able to stand RIGHT at the front of the stage, and had an AMAZING time!!! Parking was also unbelievably easy, but I realized later, that it's because I was one of the few 30-somethings there.

I love that when its jam packed, you can just watch the group from the side of the stage. Even when its full it only feels like no more than 100 people. Waaaaaay better than Slim's. Avoid that place. Anyways, from nu metal shows in 96 ( Stuck Mojo) to hipster bands like IAMX in 2007, this place is consistent, a good time, and you def want to get tickets in advance."

You close your eyes and are magically whisked away to a better place where someone is singing just for you. For me this is Justin Timberlake, Love Stoned, where the song slows down about three minutes in. Anyways...So I've recently been to a place to go and see music that might make you feel the same way. The band I saw was Say Hi to your Mom. They were pretty good. I think that this has so far been my favorite music venue in San Francisco, and I love the Fillmore, so this is a really big complement coming from me. I like this place because its small, but not trashy, the people in there are nice and not pretentious, the bartenders are fast, the cook is the same guy that cooks at Zeitgeist, (did not try the food I imagine it's a fried), the best part is that the stage is right there. You can see and hear every thing that is going on unobstructed, and the acoustics are very good, not too loud, and $10 for a show. Can't complain about that."

On one occasion I saw someone bring a cat, so they're animal friendly. When your there, you should also try their hard cider. Alcohol prices are very reasonable.

My friends and I were totally bummed but felt really cool about our story about trying to \"break into the Bottom of the Hill\" and that listening outside was just as cool...... of having some drunk b*#ch pour a pint of beer over my dorky 20 year old black bob w/blunt bangs head during the middle of a Murder City Devils/At the Drive In show. I was totally drenched but my friend insisted on staying through the end since At the Drive In were known for setting their drums on fire. Ten years later and I'm still annoyed she didn't drive my soaked self back to the dorms right then.

But there definitely had been an update to the old farmhand look I grew up accustomed to.  The trucking hats were still there, as were the plaid shirts and belt buckles, but add in a pair of Clark Kent frames, tattoo sleeves and piercings, and suddenly the look had been updated to young and cool.In addition, the concert was suppose to start at a reasonable hour and when we walked in, the two bulk posts gruffly told us that they were not open yet.  What.  Well, you have the concert posted to open at a specific time and why the heck are the doors open then?   The stage was small but did a good job of holding the band together (saw John Ralston that night, good acoustics and the drummer reminded me of the boy band Hansen, always smiling and had perfect blonde hair) and there is a counter that serves questionable food as well as a bar.  The venue had an outdoors area, which was flanked by a great dense cloud of smoke as well as steps leading to the roof (I assume)I'll be back, if anything, to support musicians.

    "review": "I spent my 20's in San Diego. When I check out a new place, I invariably compare it to something similar I experienced in San Diego. When I eat Vietnamese spring rolls, I always compare them to Eric \"Hot Chef\"'s rolls at Dao Son. When I come upon a good jukebox, I compare it to the amazingness of the one at the LiveWire. And when I check out live music, I always compare the venue to my first love music venue, the Casbah.Although I feel a little like I'm cheating on my first venue boyfriend, I do live here in San Francisco now, and I feel as though Bottom of the Hill is a good rebound.Bottom of the Hill has a lot of good qualities. First off, it's in the most perfect location ever in Potrero Hill, at least in my opinion. I've never had a hard time finding a place to park if I'm feeling lazy and don't want to walk the 10 blocks from my place. I love love love that 90 degree parking. Even San Diego's Casbah can't beat BOTH's parking ease.The id checker and will-call guy are super friendly instead of having that cooler than thou attitude that seems to persist at many clubs. The sound is pretty awesome in there, thanks in part to its small size and wood walls. There's not a bad place to check out the band, and if by chance the band is not as stellar as one had hoped, there's a pool table at the back to amuse oneself. Even on busy nights, I've never had to wait more than a few minutes for a drink. And maybe it's partly because of the fans of the bands I like, but the girl's bathroom line is mellow, usually entertaining, and never takes forever. And it's directly off the left side of the stage, so you don't have to walk to Egypt and miss out on the band whilst you go. On busy nights it can get downright hot in there, so remember to layer layer layer. But you're San Franciscans so you're used to that.  Casbah, I will always love you, but Bottom of the Hill gets me most nights now."

    "review": "I have been to two shows here and I really like this place. Bottom of the Hill reminds of places I used to go when I was in college.  The thing that I like about venues like this place is that you know that the people that are going to these shows are going for the music. The place has a nice feel to it, as you walk in you see the bar and then a nice open floor for dancing, standing or the occasionally skanking or circle pit. It is a great place to hear both local bands and a few bigger bands  that come through. There is a nice little spot outside for smoking if that is your thing and then a space to sit in the back. If there is a band that you like that is there don't miss the chance to come to a great venue. There needs to be more places like this in SF."

It's quite a small venue and I truly believe that who ever built this place forgot about the bathroom and just pretty much placed it whereever there was extra space (keep in mind that the space here is already limited). The restroom won't accomodate for more than 2 people just so you know.Upon entering you see the stage.. and yes there's also the dance floor where all these dumb hxc kids kill the mood. Luckily for me that night, I was sitting in the front on top of the ginormous sub woofer and didn't have to fight the rest of the night. Towards the back, past restroom is a pool table and a few couches where you can sit and babysit your alcohol, but it doesn't entirely tune out the deafening music. Alcohol here is pretty basic from what I remember, I recommend pre-drinking so that way none of the lame hxc dancers knock the drink off your hands. FInding parking wasn't as bad as I'd anticipated it to be, but becuase it's located in an obscure place, I couldn't help but wonder if my car had been broken into or not. I like the venue, I just don't like the location."

I mean, it was an all ages show so I guess I shouldn't have even tried to use it, and I got drunk there anyways, but it was still a total bummer. That motherfucker. Other than that I actually really liked this venue a lot. It was small so I got to hang out with the bands, there was a generally good vibe (except for the asshole door guy who took my fucking ID), a pool table, a patio, and a nice mosh pit. I saw my favorite band, Skeleton Key, here and ended up taking their drummer to my apartment... too bad I don't remember what we did. Evil, evil drunk.

Years ago, I had only arrived by car, and it was a case of driving down to the bottom of a big-assed hill.  (No irony points for the venue name, I suppose.)  So being currently bicycle-bound and living in the east bay, I was trepidacious about trying to catch a show there.  Turns out, it's not an issue.  If you approach the venue from 7th St, continue for a block on Mississippi, and loop around 17th St, you're there without combating any inclines.  Late-night exodus is just as easy-- 7th St. takes you to Market, where you can catch the all-night 800 AC Transit."

It's small, which I like; you can actually relate to the music as opposed to it being blasted to you. The bands that come here want the fans/listeners/etc. to feel the music versus the capitalistic drive to sell high-priced tickets. The stage is a little high for this size of a venue, but it kind of works out if you're in the back or stuck behind some insanely tall person. Bar-wise, they have a good selection of beers on tap and make strong drinks, all reasonably priced. Also, the bartenders are attentive and polite, something that I've rarely experienced at such places. In the back is a pool table and there is a patio off to the side where you can smoke. The bathroom is tiny and usually flooded to some extent, but this seems to be the case for every place that has live music. Oh, and because it's out of the way, parking is super easy. Major plus."

One of the walls fuses elements of California architecture with a Dr. Seuss aesthetic. They have that psychadelic window on stage and a smoking courtyard for those who hate themselves.

They walk a masterful line of being hip yet unabashedly fun, retro yet fresh.As for BotH itself, well, I've heard favorable things from so many different people that I think I out-hyped it a bit in my mind.  Not that there's anything wrong with it--it's small, no attitude, and has a funky, cartoon-retro decor (am I the only one who was reminded of a Dick Tracy set?).  All in all it's certainly in the top tier of SF music spots.  But still, it doesn't top Cafe du Nord for that perfect atmosphere.  But there was an added bonus for a tired old man like me: a nice back room with plenty of couch space and a pool table.  I have to confess we sat back here and drank through both of the openers, partly to keep our feet fresh for Honeycut and partly because the openers weren't very good.  There's also a patio to get some fresh air in, which is a nice touch, but for God's sake bring a jacket if you're going out there.Oh, and while I'm admitting to being old, could they have started the show at 9 instead of 10?  I hate it when the headliners don't even start till midnight."

BOTH is still a stalwart mainstay of SF music. BOTH is the place to see your favorite band. BOTH will not give you fresh breath, however.There is nothing classy about the joint, but it isn't a hell-hole either. The bar is cleverly located near the door and serves cheap drinks as long as you know to stick to the bottom of the shelves (aka BOTS). If you want Kettle One, expect to pay 11 dollars and have the adjacent hipsters snicker at you as you help subsidize the PBR keg. The booking is top notch and somehow manage to get bands that you'd never think would still play at such an \"intimate\" venue. The stage feels close even from the soundboard at the back of the room, but if you want to be off the beat, you can sneak out back for some pool in the back room out have a smoke out on the porch and peer in the artsy peephole of a window to look at the bands' butts. This place is a San Francisco staple and all signs indicate it isn't going anywhere."

I promise to come by for a visit sooner than later....In this love letter, I want to thank you for a few things.  In my younger days, thank you for letting in my under-aged self to see some of my favourite bands, and in such an intimate venue!  In my older days, thanks so much for having a great bar, the better to indulge myself.I know you're small, but size isn't everything, baby.  It's how you work with what you've got, and you sure know how to work it.  The tiny little stage in the corner is ample enough space for a good sized band to play.  You even serve food, a really great attribute considering that the particular part of Potrero Hill in which you are located has few other dining options without hiking a ways.And your vibe?  Crazy cool, down-to-earth, and welcoming.  I really love when we're together, because I always go home feeling pleased.  It's just that damn 22-Fillmore that puts a damper on my mood sometimes.  But that has nothing to do with you, baby.Until next time...Shannon"

Mae was playing (and they were pretty a-MAE-zing, ha.)Parking is pretty easy to find - there's plenty of free street parking on Texas St., although it's on a hill. Since I'm underage, I got the permanent marker X on both my hands and have no experience with the bar. It's pretty much in the middle of nowhere - a deserted lot, some factory-like buildings, and an auto repair shop are nearby. It was a pretty safe area though.The club is TINY, and the stage is even smaller, although that's part of what makes it so great. The atmosphere is very up close and personal, and if you're in the first couple of rows you're close enough to grab the setlist after the show, or even grab the band members (although I would highly advise against that). It's also pretty easy to find the band after the show (depending on how nice the band is). With strategic viewing between heads and taller people, anywhere in the club gives you a good view of the band.The staff is friendly, and they allow bags and cameras, though they do a quick flashlight check before you go in."

What I like:- Small.  Truly a tiny venue, with maybe capacity for a few hundred folks on a packed night.  This means you don't have to deal with throngs of fans and having to watch your favorite indie bands from a pair of binoculars.- Acoustics.  The sound in this place is I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E!- Cheap.  I've never paid more than I think $18 admission.  Beat that, Fillmore!- Intimate.  Clubs like this remind me why I became a fan of indie music in the first place.  This is the kind of place where, after the band plays, usually the band members are there at the back table, selling their cds and schwag to you ($10...way cheaper than most record stores) so they can pay for their beer, or next meal, or transport to their next gig.  Depending on priorities.  The point is.  You can chat them up.  I've met members of some of my favorite bands at shows in places like this:Ester DrangMates of StateDCfC...well, a long time ago.Troubled HubbleLiarsOf Montreal...also, a long time ago.  But still.  Hell yeah.What I don't like.-Claustrophobia.  Jesus F-ing Christ all mighty. (strong words from a Jew).  this place can get so packed, you'll wish you had a cattle prod in your pocket to keep people from smushing (or groping) you.-Parking.  The parking outside sucks.  Plain and simple.  Be prepared to walk, cab, bus, or otherwise NOT have immediate access.The club is small, intimate, well, sometimes intimate, and downright cramped, but it's the kind of place indie bands get their start, and can reach out to the teeming masses of indie-geeks like myself.  5 Stars!"

I tried to take public transportation, but that's dodgy at night. We ended up taking taxis to and from the venue, and that was expensive. I hate that doors and shows are generally so late, so that I have to miss headliners/good bands if I want to get to BART in time to get home. On the website it says happy hour is 4-7, but the show doesn't start until 8.30 at the earliest. What on earth do you do for an hour and a half? It's not very interesting there without the music. They should definitely think about timing more.PS: When I went my first time, for some reason, my name didn't show up on will call and the guy at the register was a total douche about it.

It's the kind of spot that famous bands play under different names. It's just that cool. Reminds me of LA in the 80's.They try really hard to not be so mighty whitey and I give them props for that but fact is that it's an indie rock joint and they have that on lock. Big ups!If you wanna go out and see a live show and NOT have to deal with the bad parking, mega yuppies, or newb club kids then this is your spot. Usually a hipster but educated crowd. The place gives me hope for this city."

    "review": "I have to give them 5 starts just for not using ticketmaster. If it is a big show and your worried about it selling out ticketweb only charges you an extra 2.50 and their prices are so low shows are almost always under 20 bucks. The shows are usually 18 over or all age. The stage is rather intimate but the side stage view is more of a walking path. The outdoor smoking are is nice and there is food and a bar. Dont try to sneak your under age friends drinks they will kick you out. Overall great place to see little bands and big indy bands. I even saw polysics there (all the way from japan) defiantly the place to go."

You'll have a great time, though; without a doubt. Decently priced, strong drinks. Friendly bartenders, even when they're being barraged and are constantly having to check for wristbands because it's an all-ages show. GREAT back patio. Feeling bold? Head up the stairs out back. That's where you'll find the \"green room,\" per se. My friend and I stumbled upon a gang in gold lame up there Saturday night and realized in our drunken state that they were indeed Gravy Train. We were made to feel most welcome, and proceeded to have a dandy, shiny old time before the show even started. Or maybe you shouldn't try that... Maybe we're just THAT cool that they let us pass. Maybe unbeknown to us, we were being watched the whole time, and surveyed so as to determine whether or not we deserved admission. And we passed... Oh yeah! We're that cool. Good luck with that. But even downstairs with the rest of the average joes, I promise you'll have a good time.Oh, and turns out the night I was here and later wrote this review about... Well... I met my bf on the patio. A good looking, smart, funny, musician/music lover. And he actually CALLED ME.Whaddya know. They have romance at the Hill, too."

Lots of great bands trek through here, and if there's 3 bands on the bill, you're almost guaranteed at least one excellent set. Although I like the ambiance, the space itself is awkward: inconvenient pillars block views toward the back of the room, the merch booth is set up in an inconvenient place, and getting to the bar may require a guide and/or path-clearing machete. The space is small enough that (presuming you're not behind a pillar) you'll have a decent view, if not necessarily elbow room--but hey, you're at a show, so leave your personal space issues (and your coat) in the car (which, by the way, is sadly the most convenient way to get here as it's off the major public transport routes.) Oh, and if you're like me and already losing your hearing at a terrifyingly young age, be sure to pack earplugs...it can get hella loud up in there. The sound is perilously good, though, so it can be tempting to leave your 'drums to burst. Your call."

How could you go to see Adult and not fuckin dance? Especially after being warmed up with Erase Eratta. Gosh, if your pants not too tight maybe you can move your joints and limbs. Pear Cider for 4.50? Oh well, I can deal with 50 cents difference. The bathroom is so small, I had to pivot. I heard the food was good there but didn't get a chance to try it out.

    "review": "The first show i ever saw at Bottom of the Hill sold me for all future shows to come.  I walked in, got a drink and took a tour of the place.  Walked into the back room by the pool table and pinball machine, and there was a girl there with a button maker.  She didn't work there, she wasn't charging, she was just offering up the use of her awesome machine, and sharing her ability to make buttons.  She had magazines, maps, people were using transfers, and i had a button on my jacket of the neighborhood i grew up in on my jacket for years afterward, only to lose it in a tragic laundry machine accident.  Whenever I looked at that button, BOTH was at the top of my thoughts.This place gets great small and decently sized bands to play, and although its not the most convenient venue in the city, its still worth the trek to Potrero.  With a smoking area out back, and the back area with the pool table, the space is decent, but unfortunately the good acoustics come with standing in front of the stage.  The oddest show I saw there was Captured! By Robots, http://www.capturedbyrobots.com/ , a band made up of one man and his machines.  He has robots playing instruments and during The Wedding Tour, this band rocked out to some of the most popular wedding tunes in their own bizarre way, and then proceeded to marry couples in the audience.  Some bands like the Mountain Goats prefer to play BOTH, but since getting bigger have to move on like all bands eventually do.  It helps that our good friends live upstairs in the house we have actually come to know as the BOTH house, and an evening in Potrero usually means an evening with them."

I'm never lucky enough to catch the bands who have already hit it big and play here surreptiously because, heck, I just don't go out 5 to 7 nights a week the way I did only a few years ago.  (Generally, I had no problem with leaving work at 9 or 10, and then going out.  But then, I had a boss who was tolerant when I rolled in at 9:30 or even 10.  Not so much anymore.  Hence, I'm a much duller girl.    My problem is that even then, and even in college, I had to get close to 8 hours of sleep.  So now, the regular late night forays are histoire.)"

What I WILL say is that the first show I saw in San Francisco was at the BOTH, & it has since been my favorite small venue in this or any city. Mostly because of the high quality & variety of the acts they bring in on a consistent basis. It is also arguably the least pretentious venue in the city. I've also got friends who live upstairs, & so most shows usually involve good times with said crew.It's not like Bottom of the Hill really needed another review. It's not like anyone but the infamous Lauren S (my esteemed roommate) is going to read this or find it more useful, funnier or cooler than another review. I'm just another dude in a long procession of loyal BOTH concertgoers. And that's what makes this venue so special. Its magic is as much in the quality of the music they bring in as it is in the venue itself. There are no bells & whistles here (Great American Music Hall, what?) -- you will most likely never not feel comfortable at a BOTH show."

So, if you are automotive-inclined then you are in luck.  Favorite BOTH moments (in no particular order):1.) Performing my only interview during my short lived career as a music critic with the SF band the Pleased (feat. now-producer Noah Georgeson and now solo-artist Joanna Newsom).  During the interview Joanna Newsom told me that she likes to \"knock the boots\" to the Jackson 5.  I thought, and still think, this was a rad answer.  After witnessing this show I developed my first crush in this city (on Joanna Newsom).2.) Seeing indie-rapper Atmosphere perform with a full band including a cover of the Queens of the Stone Age \"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\" but changing the lyrics from drugs to rock-stars (i.e. stuttering out \"Cobain\" instead of \"Cocaine\").  I've always wanted to find a recording of this.3.) Two Gallants stealing the show as the opening band for Rogue Wave: they set up their instruments in the dead center of the crowd - going mostly undetected so that people near the bar and in the back couldn't figure out for the life of them why the rest of us were hushing them.  The clinking of pint glasses added to the music.4) Bribing a door guy at a super sold-out performance by Interpol so that my ticketless friend could walk in with me to enjoy the show.  5) Halloween (my birthday) a few year back drunkenly stumbling in just in time to catch the entirety of Metric's Halloween performance after leaving what, in my mind, was the last great Halloween in the Castro.  Emily Haines became my next \"celebrity\" crush (I always crush on cute indie-rock musicians instead of actresses).Mmmm... I'm totally feeling nostalgic now.  Recently I haven't seen too many shows at BOTH.  I'm not sure if it is because they haven't been scoring as many great acts, or what.  Nonetheless, I'll be watching their calendar, waiting for the next good gig."

The beverages are really expensive and everywhere you turn is a wall of people.

The layout is vast and enticing to the eye, with bar, counters, windows, hallway, and low walls all sweeping you back past the stage and bathrooms toward the little back room and smoking courtyard, with it's forbidden stairs of temptation up to a place where only performers, pretty girls and VIPs dare tread.Tragically, this is the only place in San Francisco I have encountered a mosh pit, and both times, I left a little confused and a little concerned.  I've been hurt in Hartford, beaten in Boston, and assaulted in Albany, but never before have I been the most dangerous guy in the pit.  I can hold my own, but these guys were just feeble.  Is it always like this at punk shows in the Bay?  I really don't mind being a little bit scared for my life once in a while.  It's healthy.The last time I saw the Phenomenauts play at BotH, they must have been hosting a convention for anorexic men.  I'm not exactly brawny, but these guys were just bouncing off of me.  I felt bad that throwing a little weight around could move the whole crowd, but they just kept coming back.  The pit got five stars for spirit and stamina, but a single star for ability and conviction.  I deeply appreciate that you can find a diverse array of local and touring acts at the BotH, and that their ticket prices are totally affordable, as are the drinks.  The courtyard can get really crowded between sets, but it is a great little oasis when you need some time away from the speakers.  If Bottom of the Hill were closer to the heart of the city, it would rank five stars for sure, but then again, it would probably not be able to maintain the character that it has garnered sitting at the edge of civilization."

And although it gets super packed and stuffy, you can just go out back and chit chat with your pals through crappy opening bands. \"Did she say chit chat\" you ask? Why yes I did! BC for some magical and mysterious reason, a conversation really can be held out back without screaming over blaring music so the only headache you have the next morning really has to do with how much you drank the night before. While the sound systems here is pretty schizophrenic and it's anybody's guess as to why the headliner sounds horrible and opening band sounds crisp, I'm assuming this is a band equipment issue and not so much the club itself (I admit I know nothing abt PA's and such). Even when packed beyond what you expect it to be, people are cool and down to earth and even NOTICE when you're a midget like moi and will voluntarily move over a bit for ya without you even asking --- major score. I prefer BOTH over the Parkside anyday and bands I know from out of the area do too, often Bottom of the Hill being their only SF booking so I think that says a lot too. But if you like to sit at shows I warn you now it ain't happening my friends."

    "review": "Here's a funny story: my friend and I actually showed up on time for the show. Too bad the show wasn't on time for us. We looked like major dorks hanging out with our hands all X-ed up just waiting for the first band to start, but if there's any place where people won't give you shit for looking like a dork, it's the Bottom of the Hill. Being Little Susie East Bay I was a little tentative coming here, especially since two girls from our group couldn't come along at the last minute. Upon stepping inside I realized that the uncomfortable public transit journey was well worth it. First off, the staff was pretty friendly, which may not seem like a particularly necessary quality to hardened city people, but for a shy girl like me it makes the whole being underage thing a lot easier. The bartender was cool with holding my winter coat in the back and didn't even get pissed when I realized I'd left my earplugs in the pockets and needed to retrieve them.Aside from the fairly nonjudgmental staff, the atmosphere was relaxed and the decor was cool, blah blah blah. Other reviews suggested I would need earplugs which is why I brought them, but I guess the sound guy hadn't had that many because I found the sound levels quite comfortable. Yeah, I know, I'm going to be hooking up my stereo to my hearing aid when I'm 60.My only gripe would be that this place is seriously in the sticks, and a little unnerving until you get inside. I'd suggest knowing beforehand how you're going to get home. If you don't want to eat there, eat before you make your way down, and take a friend if you've never been there before. Actually, you should take all your friends."

    "review": "The Bottom of the Hill is one of the premiere music venues in San Francisco. The BOTH offers great sound, decent drink prices, an intimate environment, and occasional barbecues on Sunday which offer great food and good bands at an affordable price. There is only one reason that the BOTH doesn't get five stars....Most night clubs can be a gamble when it comes to the quality and level of the sound coming out of its speakers. Be assured, the sound at the BOTH is almost always loud and the mix is almost always good. BOTH is probably the most consistent club for sound quality and mixing in SF.Recently, a friend and I were lamenting the $6.50 whiskeys at a club in the Mission, which led us to the topic of 'which venue in the city has reasonable drink prices.' The BOTH came up and we both agreed. The venue is small- probably only fitting a couple hundred people. This fact makes it that much better when you are seeing bigger national acts or your favorite bands. Sure, you need to squeeze through here and there to get a good view, but in the end, there isn't much space between you and your rock gods- whether you are standing at the back of the club, in front of the stage, or outside smoking. The only reason that I wouldn't give BOTH five stars is the LOCATION. 'Off the beaten path' could be one way to describe the club, but I prefer to say 'a pain in the ass to get to.' In a town that revolves around public transit and taxis to shuttle its people to and fro, you're looking at a major investment of your time and/or money getting to and coming back from the BOTH. This should not discourage you, but warn those who don't already have that expectation."

Beers could be cheaper (god, I couldn't be any cheaper, though) but the girls' room has 2 stalls, which is better than one. Decent smoking patio and decent sized space. Just wish the sound quality was more consistent. One time I smoked pot in the upstairs/backstage, which shortly proved itself to be a baaaaaaaaaaaad idea. I mean, I wasn't *that* drunk beforehand, so I thought it'd be okay. My body plus drinking plus smoking weed equals barf-fest Y2K (I just felt like reminding ya'll of the year 2000, that's all), so I shoulda known better.  Long story short, Jessi called me cab after I officially turned green and I had to hold my face in this extremely unattractive position as a means to to ensure no puking on the ride home. Even though my fare ended up being 10 bucks or so, I gave the dude a twenty because I could not wait for change. After what seemed like a decade, I managed to put the right key (finally) in the lock and let my wasted ass inside my house, where I then proceeded to throw up in the sink and toilet for quite some time. Realizing that my roommate and the band would be at my house any minute, I attempted to stand my sorry ass up to hide in my bedroom. Yeah, no dice. I ended up crawling down the hallway on all fours to my room and passed out, still wearing my shoes and jacket. I remember feeling very worried that the front door would swing open right as I crawled past, totally terrifying Jessi and our friends but being too fucked up to even respond to their horror.

Four bands were playing: Tartufi, Dirty on Purpose, Say Hi To Your Mom and Irving. I really enjoyed them all expect Say Hi who were a little too droll for their own good. Dirty on Purpose played a cover and told the audience, \"The first person who can name the original artist wins a CD.\" I immediately recognized that they were playing \"Send Me An Angel\" by Real Life. I caught up to one of the band members, George, and he was excited that I had correctly named it. He said he had gotten fifteen incorrect responses. Considering that most of the crowd looked like they were barely legal, it wasn't surprising. My 80's music knowledge finally pays off! (BTW, their new CD is pretty good!)\n http://www.tartufirock.net http://www.dirtyonpurpose.com http://www.sayhitoyourmom.com http://www.thebandirving.com"

It's a small little joint that is just perfect if you want to hear good music but you also want to hear your friend talking to you as well. I'm not a huge fan of big arena shows (I try to avoid places like the Shoreline if at all possible), so Bottom of the Hill is just perfect for the sorts of bands I like to see."

The outdoor area in the back was obviously filled with smokers, but a nice convenience. They also seem to serve some kind of food (as the sign indicated) however I'm not sure about the quality. 4 bands for $8 is one of the best deals in town, if not the best. They also don't finish the night at 11 or even midnight, like most of the other venues in the city. If you plan on seeing the headliner, don't expect to get out of there until after 1am. The only downfall is the location..."

Just about every show that's booked here is guaranteed to be worthwhile, and big touring bands have a habit of playing shows here. I wish this place had a little more room to dance, especially for the bigger shows, but you can't go wrong with the BOTH. awesome, attentive bartenders, great sound crew and generally a friendly crowd. I've met tons of great people here that have gone on to become regular drinking buddies. Bigger touring bands might come to Slim's, but this place is where you want to go for the best live music any day of the week. Don't forget about the awesome summertime barbeques!"

Lucky for me, the 22 Fillmore bought me right to the front door. I've seen a few bands here & unfortunately, every single time the experience has been tarnished by fuck ups on the part of the sound guys.  When I saw Dun Gen here, the show was impossible to enjoy because they had to keep adjusting the sound. Usual overpriced bar drinks & what is essentially cafeteria food round this place out, but the venue is still better than Slim's. I really appreciate the back patio because there's nothing worse than going to a show with crappy opening bands and being forced to listen to them! And you know, you can get to the show late but then there is nowhere to stand and every single show I have ever been to has operated on punk rock time, so even if you get there after 10, there's a huge possibilty they're still on local band #1."

The interior looks like an old salsa club and it is a rustic place to watch bands that are just making it or great bands past their primeI saw Creeper Lagoon and Earlimart perform here. Both great alternative bands that sound similar to The Breeders, Elliott Smith, and Third Eye Blind.If you've heard of the great Oxford band Ride, their former lead singer performed here recently and if you've heard of the Great North Carolina pop punk band Archers of Loaf, the band's lead singer who is in another band now, performed here.It's a nice hole in the wall and usually, the shows do not sell out here. It's not the Fillmore or the Warfield theatre, where the big gigs are, but it is still well worth going to if you want to see some up and coming Californian and some National and International bands to perform.There is a very good bar and grill place to eat dinner, a block away, called the Yankee Doodle Dandy."

The club is tiny and intimate so you can somehow always manage to push your way through the sweaty, drunk crowd to the front row. You can get close enough to practically straddle the amps...or straddle your favorite artist. I saw Her Space Holiday here, and during the opening acts, the singer was watching the music, along with everyone else in the club, instead of pretentiously hanging backstage. It's the same way with all the artists who play here. The dim, musky club atmosphere mixed with the perfect amount of sketchiness from the surrounding neighborhood seems to really bring out the best in the bands who play here. And to top it all off, they allow you in and out privileges for smoke breaks."

Oftentimes you get to experience not one but up to three or more bands in a given night.  What a perfect way to not only see your favorite headliner but to get to see similar music and open up your horizons to other great music.  If you are a smoker, the outdoor patio is a great place to mingle with friends, hipsters, scenesters and even the bands as they make their way back from a performance.  My favorite aspect of the bar -- one of the few locations that you can order both a Guinness and a Strongbow.  Concert + friends + new people + Strongbow = great night.

I had to ask others to go to the ATM for me just like this other girl next to me while we waited.Understandable that they want to ensure no one sneaks in, but invading my personal space with unwarranted physical contact was rude and unnecessary; a simple verbal warning or compromise/agreement would have been much more appreciated.Visuals were great and the venue was pretty packed but it was nice to have different levels to watch the performers!

He was not rude; just asked if he really needed to have X's sharpied on both hands to show that he was not allowed to buy alcohol. He was taken out of the line to the side.After my friends and I entered the first floor was packed, and there was no order. People were constantly pushing each other to get to the front. Then, half way through the show, a fight erupted on the floor where a man smashed his glass against a woman's head (I think because she spilled beer on him). Chaos ensued. The fight went on until the performer actually stopped and asked if something could be done. Then finally the security guard came to break up the fight....Police cars parked outside the venue as I left.Disgusting management from start to finish. I will never come back again."

    "review": "A great place for a smaller/ more intimate show! Came here for a concert and was able to get right at the front of the stage. You can either stand in the lower area or stand/ sit in the upper area--the lower area goes very far back so don't arrive too late otherwise you will be far from the stage. The lower area has a bar, where they have beers on tap and they also had a cocktail special named after one of the performer's songs. They also have an upper area which is a decent size--the regulars seem to go straight up there and grab a seat on the couches and chairs. The seats are good if you don't want to be down below where you will be tight standing next to people.I like that a Rickshaw Shop is walking distance from Civic Center bart! Maybe a 10 min walk. As always be careful walking at night and try not to walk alone. If you are looking for a dinner beforehand, Cala is right next door to Rickshaw. I have never been but I've heard good things (you should make a reservation beforehand).Enjoy!"

The venue itself is just the right size, got a nice Balkony and a good cheap(for SF) full Bar, they accept all kind of cards but it will be cheaper if you pay cash. The whole interior is very chilled and feels just right burning you want something posh, this is the wrong place!

We came by when doors opened for Emo Nite but we were told that they weren't quite ready and to circle back later.When we did come back, there was a small line but it moved by pretty quickly. Once in we were stamped to indicate that our tickets were checked and we had wristbands placed on us for being 21+. Once you're inside you can pretty much see to the end of the venue with the main stage at the back. To the right as you walk in are the restrooms and there is a bar on this floor as well. There are a set of stairs to the left and there was a sign indicating that there was a bar upstairs that was open and that coat check was also located up there.When we got up there the bar was definitely not functional. There was a rack where you could hang up your jackets and take a ticket but there were no staff monitoring that so someone could in theory take your jacket. The upstairs area has some couches and has a lower level where you can watch from upstairs.I didn't drink that night but they did have a spout with water to the left of the main bar so you could help yourself.All in all it was a pretty intimate venue. The event didn't seem too packed so maybe that's why there was still a decent amount of room to move around. I think some of the hiccups may have had to do with the event organizers rather than the venue."

I hate to sound like a weenie but smoking of all kind should be outside. Some of us are really sensitive to smoke and wish ordinances would be followed. Otherwise, the casual seating was really cool and the bathroom was really nice compared to other divey places.

BATHROOMS????: YES. there are men+women bathrooms. women's had 2 stalls, decently clean for a hole in the wall venue. PARKING: we were able to get street parking on franklin very easily-and bc it was so late we didn't have to pay! Mahalia and Kiah both put on great sets, and it so cool to see them in such an intimate setting. I would come back to Rickshaw again. *one thing I will note is that if you're a person that has any type of issue w/ smoke or asthma or just breathing, a lot of people were smoking/vaping. and in such a small space, it was kind of heavy-so that wasn't too fun."

I've been to 100+ venues around the country, and I've never been so crammed into a tiny club that to watch the show I had to stand in the back of the club, literally 5 feet from the bar's center, directly under bar lights shining down on me.  Talk about a terrible way to see a show.  All lit up, constantly bothered by people trying to maneuver to buy a drink, and with all the bar noise.  There was no way to move forward--the place was that inappropriately packed.  Also, the temperature inside was too warm -- running one large fan in the balcony area doesn't cut it, people -- and the small balcony has some stupid garage door-type thing pulled partially down that blocks much of the view of the stage from the balcony.  Awful, like nobody gives a sh!t who works there.On top of the issues I mention above, the staff lack common sense.  After showing my ID, they stamped a VERY large \"HOT\" stamp on the inside of my right wrist.  It took me 1.5 days to scrub this off of my skin, and it looked far more like a \"HOT\" tattoo than a club stamp.  Thanks, guys--how about using some discretion in your stamp selection.I ended up leaving the show after about six songs despite being a big fan of the band, as I just didn't feel like dealing with the nonsense.  The show two nights earlier at GAMH was night-and-day more fun to attend.  The Rickshaw Stop may be a decent place to see an unpopular, uncrowded show, but I will never return for a show that I feel might be sold out."

There is one good thing, though, the manager gave our friend $12 back for the ticket price she paid (disregarding service fees) while she was crying on the sidewalk outside of the venue waiting for her uber.

Talks- they are funny, they have character, they are animated speakers giving a run down of their respective field with purpose. This night we got the history of SF's Trans culture, 20 math mysteries with graphics and dancing in 20 minutes, and how a physicist is working to understand dark matter. Each was beyond entertaining, captivating, and educational without feeling talked down to or watering down the content to much.

Turned out, he was the owner, and asked me and my friend to come over. He pulled out wristbands for us to attend the 10 o clock show, and told us to have a good night. We were the first to enter, and caught every song from the very front along the stage. The opening act Glades pointed the microphone at us at one point, asked us our names, and gave us a shout out.

The venue has a general admission floor and a balcony upstairs with sofas and stools. I would definitely say that the center front stools on the balcony are the best seats in the house. For someone 5'0\" tall, it's always godsend to be able to see the entire set. With two bars on each floor, you won't have to struggle getting drinks either. What I love about this place the most is the intimacy you'll find here, watching your favorite band or whoever. The place can still hold a good amount of people, but the intimacy factor of it isn't reduced. If you're familiar with other venues in SF, this place is larger than Brick & Mortar, and similar to The Chapel. Also, Aaron Axelsen is here on Fridays and he seriously made the wait before the concert and in between bands poppin'. He's also on 105.3, but I'm not too sure when he's on exactly. Usually later in the evening. Anyways, I feel like he's always bringing out the dopest remixes and he's such a good source for new music. I was really stoked to find out he was the one DJing."

When we showed up at the door my ticket wouldn't scan. The manager came over and told me I bought the ticket for the earlier 5 o clock show they had and that I'd have to buy another ticket to get in. Ticket says 5pm-2 am. Never have I heard of a venue playing 2 shows in the same night. After pleading my case and telling him how far I came to see the show he told there was nothing he could do.

Was about 8 mins from Civic/Downtown to Fell and Van Ness so super easy to get there. From the person checking ID's, to the stage crew - every single person was very nice, friendly and up beat. The balcony is cool, the couch in the back is comfy, the wooden boxes to sit or stand on on the sides of the room are a great touch. The sound system is awesome! Not too loud and high quality sound! I had a great time to see an awesome singer. The beer was reasonably priced and the bartenders are way hot! Would not hesitate to see another show there - I had a great time!"

    "review": "I can't say that I'm still a fan of the Rickshaw Stop. I like the small intimate size. And I like that the restrooms are by the door and there's hardly ever a wait. Drinks are pretty cheap and I like that the water is self-service at the end of the bar.\u00a0But the shows start late and go really long. The doors don't open until 8 o'clock, and the first act doesn't usually go on until 8:45. And don't expect the main act until well after 10. At the last show, there was a half hour wait between the two. The place was full, the stage was set, and everyone was antsy and ready to go. Is it a ploy to sell more drinks? It might not bother me if it a was the weekend but on a weeknight when I still need to take public transportation home and get up at 6:30 the next morning to go back to work, I'd like to wrap up at a reasonable hour. Subsequently. every time I've been here, I've had to leave before the main act was over which sucks. Another thing is that sound system isn't very good. I didn't realize how bad until I saw a couple of shows at The Independent for a few dollars more on the ticket price. I could hear every word the singers were singing. At the Rickshaw, the bass is really low and throbbing sometimes to the point of ridiculousness. Even in the intimate moments of songs, when the artist is playing the keyboard and singing, the sound is muddy and distorted. Not OK! They do have a balcony with a few seats but they'll be taken early by people who know they're in it for a long haul."

You get a great view of whoever's performing no matter where you are on the floor. The crowd, thankfully, isn't too unruly. The tickets were also very, very cheap - $36 for two tickets after taxes/fees and everything!I only have a few minor complaints. The sound system could have been better -- when a violinist was playing, I could barely hear that part, which was sad, because the violinist is a big part of the song. Though I'm not sure how much of that is the performer's fault vs. the venue's fault.The ticket also said 8pm, but Mako didn't start playing until much later -- probably around 10. I was a little annoyed at the time, as I didn't know how much time I was allotted to skip the opening act to finish up a task I needed to do. I'd have liked a little more transparency in terms of when the acts started/finished.But those are only minor issues. I totally recommend this place for concerts, and I wouldn't mind going back at all."

Once inside we waited, listening to bad DJ music, for a pointless half-hour until the opening act showed up, so it was nearly 9 before anything worthwhile began.The opener spent far too much of his set rambling aimlessly instead of singing, and repeatedly/effusively thanking us for showing up. After his set we waited through another 45-minute nothingness for the headliner, who performed for barely an hour.This kind of entertainment ratio is insane. Worse yet, the place has almost no seating to speak of, save for a dozen or so wooden cubes around the edges. We won't be back."

Couple of the bartenders are rude and most of the people working seem to hate their jobs. More specifically, someone broke a glass by the stage n my friends and I tried to move it out of the way so nobody would get hurt. As an employee was walking by collecting glasses, I stopped him to let him know one broke. He didn't stop or even look at me just replied with a snobby attitude \"I don't have anything to clean it with\" and just walked away. YES I CAN SEE THAT BECAUSE I'M NOT BLIND I was letting you know so someone wouldn't get hurt because you kinda work there don't have to be a douchebag.

    "review": "This place always seems to have the best upcoming indie acts. Bigger venues like The Fillmore and Bill Graham might have some of the bigger names, but whenever I discover a really great new indie band and see they're playing in SF, it seems like almost every time they're playing at rickshaw. I go to a concert at least once a week, and over half of them have been at Rickshaw, and it's not like I try to go there I just kind of end up there after looking for shows I'll like. It's a small, intimate venue, and much more relaxed than places like the fillmore. I've seen people standing on benches and even sitting on the piano (down on the floor, not the stage) and no one seemed to mind. This could be handy if you're short, especially since it's a fairly low stage so if you're shorter it can be a little harder to see (it's not too bad for the short folks out there though, in addition to standing on the furniture you can pretty much show up 10 minutes before the music starts and secure a spot in the front, or go off to the side if you don't mind the awkward angle but still want to see).The sound system sounds great, though I'm not audiophile so I cant really say much about the quality other than it seems perfectly fine. I can say though that they've probably got the best lighting system of any similarly sized venue in town, and they've just put in four brand new high tech led spotlights that look fantastic, and this is in addition to what was already a really nice looking set. Once the music starts it looks absolutely gorgeous on stage, and unfortunately your phone camera will never do it justice.The shows always are listed at 8, but they always start the music 40-50 min after, it seems to be a rule that the artists wait until at least 8:40 to start. The headliner will usually start at around ten.I don't drink, so unfortunately can't tell you much about the drink quality or pricing. They do always have a drink themed on the band that'll be playing, so it's kinda fun to see what kind of drink related puns they come up with.My biggest complaint is the lack of box office hours, you can only buy the tickets online or at the door of the specific show (can't buy tickets for a different show). I've heard you can buy the tickets for there at the independent and some other places, but I've never tried it. Also it's cash only, which is kind of annoying. But hey, buying the ticket is always the worst part of a concert right?This is a great venue, very conveniently placed (right smack in the middle of town and two blocks away from bart/muni underground), cheap tickets (usually around $14 at the door), great sound and lighting, and most important of all always having the best acts, I plan on returning often"

That is the aspect I liked the most about this venue, how you can get very close to the stage and everything is cozily compact without making it feel uncomfortably crowded or hot. The acoustics are great too!There is a bar to the right of the stage and a small seating area to the left. Also, there is some outdoor seating which is convenient when waiting for doors to open. Whether you know the musicians or not, the people, location and size of this place makes it so easy to enjoy an intimate show for an affordable price. Plus, the performers are clearly displayed on their front sign which I always enjoy scoping out when along Van Ness. :)"

I went into the venue and I am a few weeks out from my 21st birthday while my significant other is 24 years old. Neither of us bought drinks the entire night, being that we were only there about an hour. Someone came up to me that worked there and accused me of scrubbing the x'es off of my hand that indicated I was under 21. In all honesty I DID NOT do that. I used the bathroom about four times while I was there and washed my hands each time so the x'es of course washed off slightly but you could still see them on my hand. He asked me to go back to the bouncer in the front to re-mark my hands in which I was completely cooperative with, even after feeling very offended and  accused. The bouncer asked me what had happened and again I repeated to him that I had used that bathroom several times that night to which he accused me of drinking before hand and would not let me back into the rickshaw, AFTER I had paid beforehand for the specific DJ playing that night. With no protest, my s/o and I left and I feel extremely upset at the way this situation was handled tonight and will be letting ALL of my friends from college know that this place sucks going out to. I will let them know that that staff there is unfair and rude to those who may be underage and in general. I will let my friends of age know to never give there business to a theatre that accuses innocent customers of doing something wrong."

They sell 30 tickets at the door but even when buckets of rain were falling from the sky there was a line of people who had been waiting 30+ minutes for these standby tickets.- Line up ~6:30p if you want seats and a clear view- Come with an open mindThe venue was easy to find by Van Ness and Fell. Plus there will likely be a long line forming anyway. The location itself lacked seating leaving many on the floor and uncertainty whether there was a clear escape route (say if I needed to visit the ladies room). Thankfully people at the floor sat down and my view from a chair was perfect. They serve food and drink if you are hungry but I personally didn't feel like throwing $8 for a grilled cheese. As for nerd nite itself, I appreciate that there were 3 different topics; however it really is a hit or miss. It is best to buy a ticket if you have interest in at least one of the topics because otherwise these are volunteer lecturers and not professional speakers."

Not too far from Civic Center of you don't mind trudging through the  Burger King favela, you'll find yourself at this oasis on Fell, a place with cheap drinks ($10 card minimum guys, sorry!) and the best artists, be they well-known or relatively unknown. The place has one charming quality that I can't seem to find anywhere else-- intimacy. To come as close as you can to your favorite artists, completely in their element, there's something raw and authentic. Someone will miss a note or botch a cord and nobody feels shy about it, artists feel a certain openness here that is unfound anywhere else I've been. When I see a show here, it's always a chill crowd and an honest, interactive experience.

The stage is set up downstairs and it's literally the smallest stage I've ever seen. There definitely isn't very much room on the stage, but the dancefloor is decent sized. It makes the shows very intimate since you can get right up close and personal with your favorite artists. There is also an upstairs balcony area, which is nice when you go to the really packed shows. If you're short like me, it's fantastic being up there because then you can still see LOL. Sound quality is pretty great, since the venue is so small ya know, it's not too hard to see/hear everything very well. What else is there to say?

He was easy-going, helpful, and genuinely excited about the event which made planning so much more enjoyable. They made setup and cleanup a breeze, allowed us to move things around to fit our party's needs, and even helped decorate with the holiday vibe we were going for. You could tell everyone wanted to help us have a good time and keep things running smoothly. The drinks were good (they let us have 2 custom drinks on the menu which was fun and popular among guests), the bar service was fast and easy (we used the drink ticket approach), and Dan was fast and easy to communicate with throughout the entire process. Parking and safety were non-issues, there was plenty of space for our 150+ guests, and again the vibe the space lends itself to is just right for a trendy mingling and festive atmosphere.If you're looking for a hip, cool place to throw a party, this is it!

It's just ridiculous. In an intimate atmosphere you should be able to hear EVERYTHING. I actually went up to the guy at the booth in between bands and politely said it was too loud. He just shrugged.

Rickshaw is small enough so that if you get there early, you can literally be inches away from the performers, but it's also large enough so that you can get down and groovy upstairs and in the back. However, it does get insanely packed, so be warned if you're going to a sold out show. If a show is sold out and you are kicking yourself in the butt for not getting tickets in time, have no fear! They usually sell a limited number of tickets at the door, so get there early if you want to score tickets. There is also an open dance floor after the gig is over, which is always fun.

If you're a 21+ kind of person then double check before you agree to get down with that musak.One of the major pluses of Rickshaw is that you can get so close to the stage you can practically smell the sweat of the performers, if you're into that.  It's intimate, small, with good acoustics and great acts.  There's a bit of a swindler crowd that likes to prey on the vulnerable, but if you come lightly dressed you should be okay!"

Nuff' said.The bar staff is super chill, and the redheaded security dudes are some of the nicest people I've met. Not even kidding. If I have questions about late night places to grab a drunken bite, they always give me good options. Some of the events seem to sell out hella quick, so my advice is getting tickets in advance/arriving earlier. Love this place!"

I've always known it can get a bit full and you need to get there early to secure a seat or a spot on the floor. We arrived right at 7 when the doors opened, grabbed a seat at a bench upstairs near the rail. At 8 when the show started we were told we couldn't sit at the bench and needed to find a new place to sit. After an hour of securing that spot. There was no place to even stand and half the people standing near the bar couldn't see the presentations. They pack the bar in past maximum capacity, the staff is unbelievably rude and it is no longer worth going to nerd nite because of how crappy the venue is."

We were standing at the front of the stage...and it was FREEZING!!! But we stayed at the front because we totally thought we were gonna see toro y moi (according to bandsintown he was gonna dj) ((but it never happened))... anyway, the room did not get any warmer for me and my bf even when the final act came on and the crowd actually started to move around and dance more.  if u want to be at the front where the stage is, then wear 10 jackets or dance constantly so u dont freeze to death.  otherwise, i suggest staying in the middle of the crowd, on the balcony, or anywhere else where the ac wont be blowing straight at you."

If not for the stage, the lights, and the bar in the back, I'd think I'd have gone crazy. Instead, you've got some great tunes to go crazy about.Been here just a few times now. Saw the Fratellis and Monarchy here. Sound for each band was pretty great. I think they could have kicked it up a notch when it comes to the loudness, but then again we don't all wanna be deaf right? The venue itself is small enough for you to get a pretty decent view of the band from wherever you are. They've also got a pretty nifty little upstairs balcony if you want to have a seat as well. Perfect for those post-25 concert vets whose knees can't take standing for hours on end.They've got themselves a bar, but that's about it when it comes to that. They usually have a few nightly specials, but other than that it's just a kinda small bar. The Rickshaw is a pretty fun spot for concerts. Yet another reliable venue in the city!"

Its lack of ventilation makes it hard to dance on the dance floor for a long period of time without breaking out sweats. The one particular event that I go here is Gameboi, they have a great crowd and  a lot of pop music. They even play occasional K-pop. It is a 18+ up place, those over 21 will get a wristband to show they are able to drink while those under that age group will be \"X\" (permanent marker X on both hands LOL)."

We arrived around 10:15ish and there was already a long line out the door. It was packed for a Thursday night. When we walked in, we decided to take a look upstairs, where there was a small bar and a balcony with a view of the dance floor and stage. The ceiling was pretty low on the second level. Back downstairs, we bought a couple drinks (there's a minimum if you wanna use a credit card) and made our way toward the stage. The sound was pretty good. Props to the lighting guys too. There wasn't much decor except for the velvet curtain that wrapped around the venue and the visuals that were projected onto the screen behind the stage. Ladies room had 2 stalls..it wasn't super clean, but we survived. There was one spot on the floor where a fan was blasting..good if you need some air, bad if you're trying to keep your DO in one place.The cool thing was that the performers could only access the backstage area by walking through the left side of the dance floor, so we were able to say hello and grab a photo with Brodie as she walked by. Total fan girl moment.I was stoked to finally get tickets to a show at Rickshaw Stop since it is a pretty intimate venue. Expect anyone that performs here to blow up within a couple months..i.e. Jessie Ware, Sam Smith, and pretty soon Cathedrals!"

The location is also ideal for grabbing a bite before the show (try Rich Table or Chez Maman) and some cocktails after (try Absinthe or Brass Tacks).The space itself is large enough to get some great traveling bands, but small enough to feel very intimate. The stage isn't raised very high and there isn't any noticeable security or barriers set up so it's a great experience to watch the bands perform up close (just watch your head for any flying limbs from the circle pit at punk/metal shows). Btw, there's a mezzanine level with two levels of couches and benches if you want to stay out of the mix.Lastly, the shows are typically super cheap for SF standards ($10-20) as are the drinks. The bartenders are pretty fast and friendly as well, so that's a huge win."

He harassed my friend because she had a paper driver's license while she was waiting on the plastic one to be sent. She is 29 years old, come on. When he checked my ID he didn't even see my birth date because it was in my wallet and he didn't even ask me to take it out. He was condescending, rude and just plain nasty!! After harassing my friend about a LEGAL paper ID that could be scanned to prove was real (he refused to try) he admitted the event was all ages and that he couldn't keep her from coming in. So he wasted 10 minutes of our time harassing her when he could have just let her in because it was all ages. We missed the opening of the Moth and we were just there to support the event! He marked her hands with 2 huge Xs in sharpie (very dramatic) and said you better not wash these off, you better not wash these off etc. We told him we weren't interesting in drinking we just wanted to see the show but he was relentless to show us he was on a power trip and in control. Horrible experience. I would not come back if he was the bouncer, I would literally turn around and walk away because who wants to deal with a hostile bouncer who is on a power trip."

As long as I have something to lean on, standing ain't so bad. Bud was $3, which was incredible. I expected beers to be a minimum $6 since it's a concert venue, but that was not the case. A little annoyed a bearded bartender man bussed a half full beer I had on the bar (I ran to the bathroom, guess I should have went napkin over the top), but another bartender, upon hearing my plight, comped me a Dos Equis for the trouble, which was awesome.

While their sound system is not absolutely amazing, it's more than adequate and the space lends itself to some pretty intimate experiences. I shook hands with Penguin Prison before he went onstage and thanked him for playing. I saw an amazing set by Tesla Boy (their first ever in the US) and was about five feet away from the stage the entire time. The Drive Tour was fantastic with Anoraak, College and Electric Youth all playing full-length sets.Rickshaw Stop has already provided me with memories that will last a lifetime and I hope there are many more to come. Definitely check out their regular Popscene nights where you'll be sure to discover a hot new act before they go on to play much bigger (and lamer) venues."

The upstairs is nice with plush seats and games. There is also a bar upstairs. I sometimes enjoy sitting up there when I'm there for a show, but you want to get there early to grab a seat."

Great place for those under 25 to hang out. There is also a cool 2nd floor, but tables are hard to get, at least the one at the ledge. I usually tend to hang out at the bar downstairs in the back. Gives me a better view and away from the pillars blocking the stage."

On the second floor, you will find couches, chairs, a pool table, and other games/art that just gives this place so much personality. Concerts here are definitely intimate and awesome, so this venue is the perfect size to see your favorite artists when they come tour in SF. Drinks and beer are reasonably priced; I had a delicious glass of sangria that was only $5 and did not make my asian glow appear hahaha!"

    "review": "As my first club, Rickshaw Stop has a special place in my heart. The venue isn't exactly the prettiest place - it looks rather sketchy from the outside actually. Even on the inside, it's rather austere, though the rickshaw is an interesting, nice touch.I cannot comment on the food or the drinks, but as a concert venue, it's amazing. The ground floor is rather large, so it's well-suited for the acoustics. If the show's ever too wild, there is also a second floor viewing deck. Though it may be case by case, when I went, DSLRs was allowed, so as a photographer, that was definitely a plus.I came here to see Boris and Deafheaven, both of which were amazing acts. For groups that had a really powerful sound impact, the venue and setup did them justice. It was an intimate affair, and I much preferred the atmosphere compared to a larger venue.The lighting of this place is also amazing, so props to whoever was manning the lights that night. My pictures turned out well, the atmosphere of the concert was chill, and even the people were very relaxed - much unlike what you may find at a more typical concert.If Rickshaw Stop ever hosts an act I'm interested in, I'll be sure to come back.TIP: DSLR Photography is allowed (or at least at the concert I went to), so feel free to shoot away!"

    "review": "Here's my tip for you: go for the sangria.  It's the alcohol value ratio by far.  Backing up:  went to the cool Movie Video Race event last weekend and loved being washed over by the hippity-hip-hip-hipsters. Even standing in line was awesome - \"hey - I went to a silent disco on twin peaks last night\" etc. Damn, the things you learn when you get out a little.  Got inside in time to actually get a spot with our backs to the bar to hold us up as the place filled up....and up.....and up. And we were right next to the free water station so once we were packed in like sardines, we got our body rubs free as people moved past us to get their free H20.Anyway, started with a drink special with tequila because they don't have a stout that sounded interesting. It wasn't so great and definitely teeny, so went for the sangria.  Hallelujah, I hit the motherlode!  $5 and the wine is laced with a hefty portion of brandy, so by the time I was two sangrias in and my friend showed up, I'm sure she didn't recognize my sentences as english.The bartenders were very friendly and the place reminded me a smidge of New Parish, for you Oaktown folk.  I could see the band that played fairly well, and the video screens were high enough up that even the amazonian people in front of us didn't block them too much. Seriously - hubby's 6'2\" and there were MASSIVE quantities of people taller than him in front of us. Is this younger generation living longer AND getting taller? Not fair man, not fair.Oh - final stamp of approval for the Boffo cart out front that sold the Yams. Holy sriracha sauce, them puppies are delicious!  And spicy enough that we shamelessly drank someone's open and forgotten bottle of IPA that we watched sitting there on the bar for 20 minutes with no one claiming it.  So there ya go - even got a bonus drink out of it. (Don't judge - you'd have done it too, I swear.)"

I'd never even heard of RICKSHAW STOP..but, it was an all ages event (my son is 16), the location was decent, and the tix were only $12, so I took a chance. We arrived at 8 (posted start time) and waited in a long line outside. My ID was checked. My son was not required to show ID, but the back of his hands were marked with giant X's to signify no ID/underage. Once inside, we began to explore. Upstairs is a cute little room with a foosball table and a classic skee-ball game. Cool! Lots of chairs and couches for chillin upstairs. There are also 2 small tiers of balcony bench seating with a stage view. These spots were taken..so we went back downstairs. The staff was nice, and, although I didn't order a drink, the bar seemed organized and moving along at a good pace. This was a sold-out show (Sky Ferreira, How To Dress Well, and The High Highs) so I was pretty surprised we snagged a spot at the stage. Everyone was respectful..no cursing, drunken fools pushing up against us like at other venues. Sound system was amazing. Speakers took everything the bands could dish out with no distortion. Volume was loud, but not obnoxious. Watching each band set-up and tear-down inches away from us kept the 'down time' interesting. Security didn't trip when I snapped a couple pix (no flash) which was refreshing. The entire place (including restroom) was clean and well maintained. Can't wait to come back to this venue!!"

Everywhere on their website and one the performer's website it sited that the show started at 9pm. well its midnight now and their headlining act hasn't even started. Okay I get it. Some super stars don't like to start on time. But 3 hours later? thats a bit much. I got fed up and decided to leave, so I went to close out  my tap. The male bartender scoffed at me and preceded to take 4 other orders before even trying to close my tap. I politely asked the female bartender (while I witnessed him serving 4 other people) to check on it and she gave me some bitchy attitude saying they're busy. I understand you're busy. I fucking work in the service industry and I get that thursday-sunday are your busy nights, but don't give me that 'holier than thou' bartender attitude that you think you're deserving of. Then I went to ask for a refund of my money, since I waited 3 HOURS to see someone play, all I got was attitude.Your venus is OKAY at best with your shitty acoustics. Your bartenders are less than personable. Here's a tip. Hire better bartenders who don't give attitude TO PAYING CUSTOMERS, and don't advertise for a certain time and start 3 hours later"

Change over between bands was quick and efficient.  Matt Pond complained about some problem with the monitor mix, but it sounded good in the house.Some earlier reviews talk about how hot it was, but that's not true anymore.  They must have heeded earlier complaints and installed an air conditioning system that blasts cold misty air over the stage into the audience.  If anything a little too cold, but better than roasting.The grill upstairs isn't terribly impressive; perhaps they serve food to qualify as a restaurant that can allow entrance to people under 21.  If so, good on them, because clearly some of the crowd wouldn't have qualified otherwise."

I only have one problem, and it's quite a big problem.When I come here for the performers, there are a great number of photographers that attend as well. I don't know whether they are the performers' photographers or the venue's, but every time I have been at the front they end up jumping and standing right in front of the other concert-goers and I. They love to move their arms around to get every possible angle taken on their cameras, blocking the view of the people who were standing in the front originally, and it's an extreme disappointment for those who have stood in line outside and stood right in front for an hour waiting to see an artist that the photographer could care less about.I have had more than one photographer talk down to my friends and I, and I've even had one elbow me in the face--with no apology--while he was taking pictures at extreme angles.It's very unfortunate for everyone who paid to be there, and one could only hope something could be done about this."

I've been to the Fillmore, Warfield, Billy Graham, Great American Music Halll, Bimbo's, the Independent, Mezzanine, and last night -- RICKSHAW!HANDS DOWN my #1 favorite venue. I am all for intimate venues. This was such a hole in the wall venue and the fact that it was smaller made the event all the more meaningful. No doubt about it, I want Rickshaw to be my go-to spot from now on for live music. I was there to see Jessie Ware and you could tell that each person who was in there was a die-hard fan. Acoustics: TOP notch. The sound of the bass player & drummer were incomparable to anything else. It was literally like I had a private session with them -- that's how good their sound was live. On top of that, you can head upstairs where there's a beautiful balcony that overlooks the stage (perfect view if you're lucky to snag a good spot first), as well as a couch for anyone who wants to chill. My friend and I were posted there during the opening act. Only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of the heat. I was prepared after reading the Yelp reviews but I was still dying while I was in there. They need some ventilation :) But hey, we were in awe of Jessie's talent so it didn't bug me too much."

I know I'm young and I'm Asian but I swear to you my ID is real sir and \"did you need something?\" doesn't seem polite when walking up to a bar. Other than that, positive reviews for this place cuz of the venue itself.. I love their video playbacks and the second story which is a balcony with couches for more tired and comfy couples. I believe there was more space and seating further back upstairs.. Only thing is, this place gets really packed, based off of the few times I've gone here.....But that's because of the awesome artists that come thru. There inbetween sets music is awesome as well. not so crappy house/electronic music that's more my style and the crowd varies from both young to old. Sound is great too (especially with Tom Krell's voice it was absolute magic)Bottled beers are $4 and there are in and outs only for 21+The shows themselves are fairly inexpensive... Paying only $14 to see How To Dress Well (i'd even pay more just to see him &) ) Overall, nice place.. For the few times I've gone, I've always wondered why I haven't gone more.

Sound!The sound on stage was absolutely superb.Most venues only care what the sound is like for people watching the show, but leave the sound on stage as an afterthought.  Normally it's just a cacophony of all sounds overwhelming each other leaving me guessing what's going on. But not at the Rickshaw, where the sound on stage was amazingly clear.  I could actually hear the guitars, the vocals, and my bass.The stage is great as well.  It's big, with lots of room to move around.  It's not too high or too low, so we have a good view of the crowd and feel like we're right on top of them. And lighting was fantastic as well.  It actually went along with what we were playing, mood-wise and tempo as well.It's a great venue to play a gig at, which in turn makes it a great venue to watch a band as well.

It was supposed to be my birthday present to him.  I saw three different promotions for the show, they all said 8PM show.  It also said it would open with DJ music, so I guessed Paloma wouldn't start at 8, but hopefully not too late as we had to drive home the two hours so my friend could go to work the next day- but we figured if the show lasted til 11, we could get back home by 1.  Well, we stood in line out in the cold windy sidewalk for an hour, they finally opened the doors at 8:25...some guy kept coming out to look at the line, but wouldn't say when the doors would open.  OK, so we get inside at 8:45, get settled in upstairs and listen to the DJ play Motown 60's, which was great.  By 9:30, my friend is getting stressed about how late the trains run to get back to our car, and after 10 more minutes, said he isn't really in the mood to wait any longer.  The place had filled up long ago and we noticed some people were giving up their seats and leaving (mostly older folks, it was a really mixed crowd.)  It wasn't so much we minded losing out on our $15 admission, but we really wanted to see Paloma perform and felt like the 8pm time was really misleading.  As we left, I asked the doorman when Paloma would actually  play, and he said 10pm.  I guess my biggest gripe was the lack of clarity of the schedule- if I had known the show didn't really start til 10, I wouldn't have bought tickets.  I liked everything else about the Rickshaw, I only wish the venue would be more transparent in their timetable.  It gave me the feeling they wanted people in two hours early to buy more drinks.  Hey Rickshaw, would it really be so hard to say \"doors open at eight, showtime at 10?\""

    "review": "I've been here a couple times, and on Friday I saw my second show here (Sharon Van Etten), which was amazing. Granted, they had their own sound engineer, but all the levels were perfect and the songs sounded so crisp--even a bit better than my other favorite little SF venue, Bottom of the Hill. The only drawback to the live show was being stuck behind a bunch of obnoxiously tall people--I wish more small venues like this had sloped flooring for us shorter people. If the opening band sucks (like this one did) see if you can snag the big comfy red couch by the merch table--and if that's full, traverse upstairs for somewhat limited \"mezzanine\" seating. Apparently there is a smoking room up there, so be aware if you're sensitive to that. They have a good drink selection and have cute specials that are themed after the performers (the \"Van Etten\" consisted of white champagne grapes and other yummy ingredients). I stuck with an Ace cider. This place is in a weird area, but it sounds like people actually don't have too much of a problem parking around here? I've had my car broken into too many times to trust it around these parts, though."

Besides it being a major plus that they had such a phenomenal artist at their venue, it was a cool spot. There's a second floor with chairs, benches, and couches (early birds get the worm). I tend to get hesitant with public couches, but thankfully I didn't have any issues there. The main floor is also huge. It has a very convenient location, on Fell and Van Ness, with easy access for street parking."

Fantastic Deal, makes up for cover, even if it's for a great band at $15.Get there at least 20 minutes early to snag a good couch on the balcony.You can park in the dingy yellow almost-painted spots along the street at night.  (got a spot after someone in front of me starred at it for 30 seconds before going all risk-averse)Beware of anyone who's hands are conveniently covered by long sleeves and asks you to buy their drink.

Summary: Casual clubbing with games and drink specials including special events with a cover.Somewhat big \"dance\" area with a crazy mix of music, hippies were everywhere!  I like how casual everything was, it really reminded me of a house party.Berlin ping pong - paddles are just laying around, a circle forms around the table, everyone pounds on the table to commence the start of the game, once everyone wanting to play has joined, the 1st player hits the ball and moves to the side, the opposite returns then moves to the side, the players walk around the table hitting the ping pong until they mess up.  Fun, easy, chill, can play while drinking, and awesome way to get to know your \"neighbor\".  Drink specials - changes all the time2nd floor: has a over view of the entire dance floor, has a rickshaw, skeet ball, and foosball (1 of the guys is missing feet), sofas, and chairs. LOVE everything about this.The atmosphere is very laid back, and if hippies are your thing, you'll love this place.  Not sure if its every day, but for this event, there was a $5 cover."

It mixes the athleticism of running, the hand-eye coordination of drinking, and the fun of inebriation. I went there for the Berlin style ping pong. It was a blast. It's coming up again and they're bringing another table along with foosball and skeeball. The drinks were pretty cheap. I feel like I can never gauge how much a drink is going to cost me in this city based on the decor of the place. But the prices match the setting which is nice because I'm poor and I usually have to slip in with a flask. Not so much here.The crowd is very mixed and get ready for hipster watching, and the occasional older ladies joining in on the fun."

The ceiling is so thoroughly draped, you'll want to sleep on it. *The space feels intimate but not claustrophobically so, with a large open downstairs and a secluded upstairs lounge that offers an ideal view of the stage and comfy seating. It's SO worth getting there early to snag one of these primo spots. *Full bar, with cute little cans of Sofia sparkling wine to sip from a straw! I like my beer straight out the bottle, and my champagne straight out the can.*Good flow between the three key areas: bar, bathroom, stage. It feels clean, not pristine; and hip, with just a hint of hipster. Overall, a great place to be entertained by some stellar local acts (Sea of Bees...I heart you so much...will you autograph my bra strap, pleeeeeease?!?)"

It is an 18 and up venue, which is a minus in my mind, but of course that's good if you're 18-20.... I like how the space has two levels, the drinks are strong, and they get good shows. Not the best venue I've been to, but it's usually a good time. Just be prepared to get (or throw) some elbows if you're concerned about your space.Initial thoughts: what a frickin mess. unless you are 18-20, i suggest staying away. idiots were pushing through all over the place, as if mommy & daddy had just let them out of the house. this place screams all-ages club filled with kids who don't know how to hold their liquor. not at all my scene, but at least i had fun dancing."

Thank god!First of all, it was only $35 (at the time we bought tickets about 2 weeks in advance) and included a live show by the Limosines and and awesome dance party courtesy of some Popscene DJs from Portland who were amazing!  I like that they didn't ovesell the event.  There was actually room to dance and move around.This is a hipster paradise and I love it.  Saw some incredible creative and beautiful outfits that night!

Ugh!My friend ordered jack and coke and I ordered coke. She had poured only jack in the first glass and I said oh sorry, I want my coke without ice. She goes everybody orders with ice generally. I am like i know. Sorry. But she did not pour my coke without ice! She was not finished making the first drink yet when i corrected my order! And ofcourse has not charged anything. I was so shocked with her rudeness that I just accepted it. Now I am pissed. oh and coke was $4! The reason I am so pissed is that she went out of her way to be rude.  It's one thing if she already had poured the coke in the glass with ice and had to waste that coke to give me correct order.  I would totally understand. Even though most of the people would make a new drink to make customer happy. So in the end I paid $20 cover and four times the actual price of coke just to be greeted in such a \"nice\" way. Feels really good.About the music and actual club, it's ok i guess.  Nothing special, If anything the space is really small. Certainly the rude welcoming experience did not help their cause."

    "review": "UMMMMM....  :XOk, honesty is the best policy right? Rickshaw Stop is just NOT my scene. I didn't even know this place existed much less was located 1.5 blocks from the office. In theory, it would be the perfect spot to Party Like A Rockstar then crawl underneath my desk, wake up the next morning, and hope no one remembers what I wore the previous day. Ok, maybe not because I'm a lady after all.Rickshaw Stop is a club that has live band performances specifically Indie music. They also have Bhangra nights which is some sort of Indian folk dancing.  When we ended up here last night (not by choice) for a Popscene party, I pretty much sobered up after seeing shirtless men doing interpretive dances. A guy next to us then started throwing up all over himself while no one even seemed to care. That pretty much sealed the deal for me.  Now that I got that out of the way, I'll keep this to a venue only review. COVER$15-$20 (Depending on the performers, tickets can be bought online fro $5-$15)DRESS CODENoneCROWDVery mixed but mainly hippies and hipsters.MUSICIndie. I don't even know what this is so not even going to elaborate on this. BAR2 barsDRINKS$9-$10 for top shelf liquor. $20 minimum for CC'sAMBIANCE/D\u00c9CORSmall, grey, and sweaty. Huge ceiling-to-floor red curtains added a splash of color along with the tv projection scene playing psychedelic images. The main level has the dance floor and stage. The upper balcony level has a couches, food bar, and a smoking lounge. There were also two rickshaw carts which I really wanted to crawl into to sleep but it probably would have broken into pieces. PARKINGPlenty of street parking. Beware of street cleaning though so make sure to check the signs. That is all...P.S. - This is a generous 3 STAR review because security aren't douchebags which most SF clubs employ."

It's a good medium sized venue, has great lighting and atmosphere with the curtains along the walls, and I like that it has an upstairs. This is key, because sometimes you just want to hang back and watch a band from slightly afar. Only downside is that the draft is almost always warm."

I went here back in July for a concert during the week. Everything as far as the staff, bartenders, and overall atmosphere were really nice. I especially liked the upstairs chill area - a nice place to go to get away from the bottleneck that is the entry way. Now for the bad. First off, this place was RIDICULOUSLY HOT INSIDE. It was retarded... no AC, and although they have tons of fans on the ceilings, they wouldn't turn any of them on. I've been to countless overpacked venues and this place was stupidly hot beyond all others. Secondly, the sound system SUCKS hard. sucks so hard that it's just laughable. What's with the arrogant DJ not turning down the sound for a second so the band can do a decent sound check? The band had to ask multiple times and the dude would NOT turn it down. They had to just start the show without going through a full sound check... which probably let to the multiple problems with the sound throughout the show. The tremble would knock out the speaker ever so often and the speakers would constantly crackle from the vocalist. It was sad.thankfully the tickets were super cheap, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this place blows."

The staff is friendly and relaxed, the ambience is great, and the shows are darn cheap!If you are looking for a cheap show and you don't care who the band is, then do I have the place for you.  Generally the most expensive show they have will cost around 12 dollars, no service charge at the door.  The stage is a bit small, but the venue is a bit small.  You can get as close as you want because the floor is pretty big.  I saw Miniature tigers and Neon Indian here and that was the most packed its ever been.  So no worries about sweaty drunks shoving their elbows into you.  There are about three rickshaws around the place that you can sit on, along with more comfortable furnishings.  There are plenty of couches and chairs upstairs for people to sit on, but they get snatched up quick.  I do wish they had some more seating up stairs for this reason.  It is nice to watch the show from a comfy green couch or stare out over the crowd. They have Bhangra Dancing once or twice a month, but I have not been yet.  The shows they have here are generally pretty small, indie bands, so don't expect a huge crowd to show up.  The drinks are pretty varied and well priced.  (Jack and Coke $6)Parking is on the street, but i've never had a problem with it.  This is a great venue.  I've loved it from the big shows to the small.  They bring in great bands and you don't have to spend your whole wallet.  So pull up a couch, buy a drink, and enjoy a show at the Rickshaw."

It had been a hectic few weeks, and I felt like when I went in to The Rickshaw Stop, all of a sudden everything mellowed out. The atmosphere was both calm and friendly. The red curtains gave the place such a nice feeling. Everyone seemed in good cheer and sharing that energy with everyone else, which was something I hadn't felt much since moving to California. The upstairs was pretty cool too, with the bike and the couches. The bar served reasonably priced and creative drinks (the special is always themed with the evening's features.) One of the staff asked me for my I.D. because I fit the description of someone who had apparently stolen someone else's purse, and then, unlike in most situations, when I tried to inquire and help, instead of being a jerk, he was cooperative and instead of what could have been a terrible experience, it was a pleasant exchange, and i made sure to let him know that and thank him for handling the situation so well.I came back for a bunch more shows, all of which were also satisfactory and beeming with good vibes.Lastly, I was so elated to find that Nerd Nite not only exists outside of Boston, but is so well attended in San Francisco!I loved living right across the street from the Rickshaw Stop for the brief time that i got to do so.

    "review": "It seems to me that reviewing a venue is more like reviewing the time you had or the show you saw unless there was some horrible experience with the staff.  So.  Because I had a really good time seeing No Age here the other night, I'm giving it 4 stars.  There was a mosh pit, where a crowd surfer came about two inches from landing on my head, a young man who more or less head-butted me, and a head banging chick who kept violently running into me as she could not see through her mass of Cousin It-like hair.  The stage was only raised by about two feet, as evidenced from the two baseball sized bruises on my knees from being pushed into the stage by never ceasing, pounding waves of human bodies.  Needless to say, despite the near concussion and other injuries, it was a great time.Also helpful: I found the bartender to have supernatural hearing, an admirable quality when attempting to shout my drink order mid-song.  I couldn't even hear myself, but somehow, amazingly, he was able to ascertain the drink order and get the requested alcohol into my hand.  Amen."

It also made me feel old and lame - when did I become such an uptight adult?However, fleeing that scene led me to find the skeeball upstairs, which was pretty rad.  And even on the balcony you have a decent view of the performance and the noise level is perfect if you want to listen to the music while also being able to hold a conversation.So if you can deal with underage kids and like a laid back environment, this place may be for you.  Just don't forget your skinny jeans, ironic t-shirt and plaid. Not sure if they'll let you through the doors without those. ;)"

I love the awesome crowd, mellowed down by booze and sangria.The band also featured 3 other artists: Please Do Not FightBird By BirdThe Girlfriend SeasonThe place is a small loft, with a dim-lit stage, a few tables and chairs, pretty much it was a \"standing room\" which was spacey enough for the swaying crowd. The bartenders were nice and their drink mixes were incredible. I like how accessible it is for commuters like me and it was easy to find. It was worth the walk from the MUNI/BART station, that night. The slow brain punch made my night! smooth!I'll definitely come back for more indie group bands! oh lala! :)"

I really liked the idea of people hanging out and listening to science put in a fun and creative way, like Zombie brains, where a necro-neurologist discussed real brain atrophies that could contribute to the Zombie brain, if existed.  I am a scientist myself, so I might be sort of biased. The atmosphere of this bike messenger hang-out is pretty cool, with a balcony looking onto the stage, and a Skeeball machine in the back. The bartenders were really nice and receptive.   I plan to come back and see a live show sometime.  Parking was really easy, or I got lucky. Cash only, but they have an ATM."

I LOVE the free Foosball table! I have played many games with friends and new found friends. There is also plenty of seating upstairs including ones where you can still see the stage. I don't like the smoking room upstairs, considering there's ins and outs anyhow, but I think it's convenient for smokers. However, there is now a SKEEBALL machine inside!! If you break 200 pts, you win a free drink! I also like the 2 rickshaws they have as decor! They make for fun, drunk photo opps. The sound system is decent and the red curtains on stage and around the venue are nice. The drinks are average priced and the staff are nice. The venue is large enough to have an epic dance party, yet still feels intimate. It's a great place to catch or show or dance your pants off."

If I had known there was no coat check, I would have brought a different (smaller) bag and coat. It was a total bummer trying to keep track of my coat all night.I liked the rickshaws all around!

I was amazed at the amount of close parking for a Friday night as well.  Lot's of really cute chicks, many single, some a little too wasted, friendly bartenders (when it was time to sober up and stop drinking, they gave me free Cokes), and just a really laid back, chill crowd. Only negative was the jackass who was so drunk he could hardly piss in the urinal.  I actually stood behind and to the side, as I was not in the mood to be saturated in urine.  It was like when you take a diaper off a baby and they piss all over the place.   Aside from that, I will definitely be coming back.  Popscene moving there in January only makes this place better."

    "review": "Pretty decent venue. Space is intimate, sound carries well. Coat check upstairs. Smoking room has foosball and skee ball. I didn't go in, but I eyed the smokers with envy as I'm a sucker for skeeball. Well, maybe it wasn't even skeeball.. I don't know. Looked like it from the outside looking in.If you like to sit, like I do, then head upstairs. No seating on the main floor.Upstairs has two levels. Both with various seats. My man and I snagged a love seat couch and yea, we made out. It was fun watching couples cram into rickshaw seats. If you want to ensure that you can actually SEE the band/stage then make sure you are on the lower of the two upper levels and bellied up to the rail. Because as we found last night (Freelance Whales and Miniature Tigers, vg btw) when the main acts come on stage people will come stand between you and the rail thereby blocking your view if you are seated. Upstairs bar has no tap and only bottled beers/Bathrooms were nasty! But that's normal in these venues.Crowd was very young. Lots of high school kids with back packs. Upon entry I joked with the bouncer that we (me and my main squeeze) would probably be the grandpa and grandma in the club. He took one look at my ID and said \"I think you already win that award by a long shot\". I would like to note that I saw at least 3 men in their 60's here. So we did not win that prize. There were also dads chaperoning their underage kids. That was funny, watching the kids ignore their dad as dad tried to engage said children in conversations.As far as local venues to see up and coming acts in a small setting. This one was pretty good. I'd go back, grandma status aside."

Regardless, I think my experience was a bit different, because I went for a CD release rather than to dance.This place definitely is a hipster haven. It's bigger than a lot of the other venues I've been to, and it's really hard to see the stage from the back. There were a bunch of drunk people dancing around the back and congregating around the bar, and this older man grabbed my ass. Awkward. Honestly, I think next time I'm going to a show, I think I'll stick with places like Bottom of the Hill or Slim's."

I have no idea what it's like as a club, but from some of the pictures posted, it looks like a lot of drunkies dancing with brightly colored beverages.As a music venue, I've enjoyed Rickshaw overall.  The place certainly has personality including random rickshaws placed around the space.  The bar is conveniently located on the side and is cheap.  The venue itself is a good size with a smaller balcony in the back for people trying to avoid the standing room crowd.My only complaint about the venue is the crowd sometimes errs toward the young'uns side, which can make me feel like an old creepy dude scouting.  Once I went to a show where the opening band was clearly from the local high school as the front of the room became heavily populated with kids with backpacks.  They began moshing to music that probably shouldn't be moshed to.Another time, I went to watch a Wavves show and a young man jumped on stage and started dancing like a chimpanzee on crack.  He tried to fend off a bouncer who was about 3x his size and ended up getting choke slammed off the stage.  Definitely worth the price of admission."

Bar service is fast considering the setup is not ideal as it's in between the main floor and the bathrooms. Congestion happens but they seem to turn over customers rather quick. Smoking room upstairs can get pretty stinky and humid but they allow you to go in and out if you're over 21 for air. Major drawback is the lack of ventilation. Both shows I've seen turned into a yoga hotbox fart factory from hell. Main door in front is the only source of air, time to upgrade your systems yo."

The girl at the door was really nice (she later on came to us when we were taking a break outside and offered us gummies!).Inside, the music was pretty good.  I danced crazily because I figured, well, no one's gonna look at me anyway - it's a lesbian night after all.  But, lo and behold, a girl across the stage points to me and gestures for me to go over...First thought: \"It's a lesbian night!  What could she want from me?\"Second thought: \"Does she think I'm a lesbian!?\"Third thought: \"I REFUSE TO BE JUSTIN BIEBER.\"Anyway I go over and turns out it's her girl friend who's interested (read: drunk).  I politely interact with her (read: avoid being vomited on) to try and see if maybe she thought I was a lesbian, but alas, she did not.

    "review": "First and last experience at this venue tonight is sadly something that I won't soon forget.  Not only was I dismayed to find the cover at the door for the night was 50% higher than was advertised on their website, but the night got worse from there.I was invited by some friends to come out and see/hear this apparently great DJ, but when I got there the club was nearly empty, but my friends were there, and I guess that's what really matters.  I had one drink and then switched to consuming little plastic cups of tap-water.  I hadn't been at the club much more than a half an hour when I decided to go outside to check the BART schedule on my smartphone (due to crappy reception in the club).  I carried an almost empty little plastic cup of tap-water with me to the door.  The bouncer, or at least this very non-official-looking skinny guy by the door informed me that I couldn't take my drink outside.  \"It's okay, it's just water\", I said.  \"You can't take alcohol outside.  There's an open container law\", he replied.  \"No, it's just water\", I said again, thinking he hadn't heard me, and I attempted to walk past him.  Suddenly, he swiped the cup from my hand so violently that it tore in half and he started shoving me.  Of course, at this point I began to protest, yelling \"What the h*ll\", and insisting that I was only carrying water.  The 'bouncer' escalated his violence in turn, yelling and shoving.  He was quickly joined by a short young woman (who I believe was the one who had collected my exorbitant cover charge) in the yelling.  The 'bouncer' demanded that I leave and threatened to call the police.  I freely admit to yelling and hurling a few expletives at these two, but at no time did I do anything improper or touch either of them.  I demanded that they \"get out of my face\", but the shoving and cursing from them just continued.  Suddenly, they were joined by a third small young man in the yelling match.  I demanded several times to know who all these people were.  Only the small man answered me, claiming to be the club owner.  I was shocked by this, as he was clearly much younger than I.  He appeared to be not far from college age.  The yelling and shoving continued, yet at no time did I raise a hand to any of these three, despite my outrage.  I haven't been in a fist-fight since middle school, and I certainly wasn't about to stoop to that level again.  Finally, I turned and walked away.  I suppose the entire altercation couldn't have lasted more than one or two minutes.In conclusion, you should not give these aggressive a**holes any of your hard earned money.  The owners and employees of this club are the dregs of humanity and should be avoided at all cost.  Please find somewhere else to hear music and buy a drink with your friends."

Grand Archives was playing; my boyfriend explained to me that when former band Carissa's Wierd (sic) broke up, some of those members formed Grand Archives, while others formed Band of Horses. So that new knowledge helped me appreciate the night's cleverly named drink special: Clarissa's Wired, containing gin, Grand Marnier, grenadine and lemon. I sipped it while exploring the upstairs seating area, envying the people who scored a spot on a bench with a snake face carved into one end.We took ownership over a wooden structure to the left of the high-up stage on the main level. When I leaned back far enough into the lush, red curtain, I was relieved to discover a wall. Usually when I have a few drinks, I don't act stupid or anything--I just become uncontrollably tired. Thus, after one Clarissa's Wired and two sangrias, I passed out on the wooden structure. My head rolled  around throughout the show because I wanted to stay awake so badly, attempting to nod my head and stomp my feet. But alas, my Clarissa's cocktail left me anything but wired."

It's laid back and not too full of itself, or full of unnecessary security, or inflated ticket prices.They have a bar in the back of the main floor, which I prefer to the side bar layout of the Fillmore, mostly because the traffic to/from will walk next to you going forward/back instead of constantly in front of you going side to side. The drinks aren't great, but they aren't high-priced either.Upstairs is a small balcony and a bunch of hipster-style victorian furniture. When we've gone it hasn't been so crowded downstairs that you really wished for a place to escape, but the couches do still provide a great respite from standing and getting bumped. All in all, you can go here and enjoy a show without the annoying crowd factors you get at some other places."

Expensive, rude staff, aggressive crowd, and their bathrooms are less than sanitary...I came here last night (Non-Stop Bhangra) for a friend's birthday, and I have never had such a bad clubbing experience - in any country!  Summary on the night's events...-- $20 cover-charge for everyone!  Doesn't matter if you're with a large party or rock up late - it's $20!  I don't normally believe in paying a huge cover to enter a club, because they overcharge you on drinks once you're in there, but because it was for a friend's b'day, I didn't say anything.-- $3 to check anything into the cloakroom, and $2 each time you want to retrieve anything!  My friend was buying drinks & he was $1 short, so I asked the girl who had just checked my bag in, if I could access my wallet - she was going to charge me $2, to get $1 out of my bag!!  No way!-- The guys there are aggressive!  I don't know what was in the air, but my friend (John) nearly got beaten up trying to rescue me from this guy who kept trying to dance with me, even though I'd already politely refused him earlier.  I think the guy thought John was cutting in on him, so he started getting really pissed, until I assured him that John was a friend of mine.  Even so, the guy was like, \"Let's take it outside\", and wouldn't leave us alone until another friend stepped in to pacify him.-- The best part of the night was when they (temporarily) lost my things at the cloakroom when I went back to reclaim them... Not only that, but the girl was really rude about it!  First, she pretty much ignored me for 5 min., even though I was standing right there holding my ticket, and started tidying up/rearranging stuff inside; then when I asked if I could please get my bag out, she pretended not to have realized what I was waiting for.  Next thing I know, she starts texting on her phone!  What the?!?So I asked again (more directly) - \"Err... could I please have my bag - now??\"  And she said, \"We're having a little trouble finding it - I'm just calling the guy who was minding the cloakroom earlier - maybe he moved it.\"  How stupid!  Why would he do that??So then I asked if I could please come in to take a look, cause I'd recognize it - but she wouldn't let me and continued texting.Finally she asked me what it looked like; I described it; and after taking a 3rd look, she found it - it was right there the whole time!!But she didn't say anything or apologize for wasting my time - and my friends had been there waiting with me the whole time!Anyway, the night was saved by the fact that I was in good company, but I vowed NEVER to come back here EVER again!!! - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - EDIT: The next day, I discovered huge reddish-brown stains all over my JC velour handbag!!

I went for a Morning Benders show and was disappointed to find that all of the opening bands SUCKED, and the audience was a bunch of annoying hipster fucks who kept pushing me. One girl was so drunk that she broke a glass beer bottle IN HER HAND then proceeded to bend to the floor for about 20 minutes picking up the pieces of glass one by one, while her hands were bleeding everywhere. It was disgusting. Right after the show was over I saw some guy doing a line off his friend's hand right in the middle of the floor. Classy! But the worst part was some drunk bitch threw up all over my boots, and right afterwards didn't apologize or go to the bathroom to clean herself up or anything, just kept dancing. Ridiculous."

Definitely a different scene then downtown SJ. Blow up used to play electro, house, dance and just all in all shake your ass jams. They also had eclectic DJ's come in. I loved it and wish they didn't have to shut it down! This place is 18 and over so the crowd is definitely different from what I'm used to. It gets stannnnnnky, sticky and very sweaty very quickly! But if your sweatin up a storm your probably having the time of your life! Everyone I've taken to Blow up absolutely LOVED it! I wish there was something similar in SJ...but because its not in the city will it still be an adventure?! Most the time I came here I never had to pay a cover :) but once in awhile i did which was $10 for 21 and over and I forgot how much it was for 18 and over. It was about $5-$10 more if I recall correctly.5 stars for the entire experience and BLOW UP in general4 stars for the venue. Its a small place but who doesn't love red velvet curtains!? Hahahaha.  The upstair's lounge area was cool too. Definitely where I was when I didn't want to get hit on or sweated on!!!! And the smoke area is located upstairs but beware there are no windows! So if you have virgin lungs like I do, I don't suggest going in there! But for you smokers.......its perfect for you!Took one star off due to some incidents that I've encountered with SOME of the KIDS who are under 21 who are absolutely rude, immature and disgusting. Everyone is out to have a good time but fuck did you really have to forget your manners AND how to take a piss and shit like a normal person!! We are not camping! Gross.One more thing, OMG the coat check was expensive! So if you decide to bring a coat and all that good stuff expect to pay a hefty fee for it."

Parking was easy, door was easy, bar was easy with a full drink red bull and vodka not skimpy and reasonable price with very nice bartender and FREE WATER AVAILABLE instead of the $4 bottled water at many other clubs!  Nice open space and positive crowd like at any Zion-I show great uplifting hip-hop and drum-n-bass sound really should check them out.  Overall a very good night would go there to see a show again."

[rant]Event Organizers know people are coming to see someone who's musical genre we probably prefer, so why do they always pick openers that play a completely different type of sound? For my sanity and physical health (the ears were about to start bleeding) I had to step outside plenty of times between openers and even DURING a few. [/rant]It's smaller than other places, but for the size of the crowd that night: ideal. The rickshaws were cute, the ambiance much like the old-school dive bars I've seen in Bali, and the bartenders friendly. I had a few cocktails - two people made them delicious (strong yet sweet), another guy used the cheap stuff that tasted like mouthwash without the minty freshness.If you get there early, you could save yourself a seat in the loungey zone upstairs and hang out while all the openers do their thing. We got there at 7:55 and 4 bands + a little over 3 hours later, we heard Zee Avi. The highlight of that night was Zee Avi's performance, then running into her in the restroom and chatting with her for a bit."

Finally last night, I got to see 'em funky fresh in the flesh! To be brutally honest though, I didn't really care too much for the opening acts. The first guy sat there playing his acoustic guitar damn near had me ready to swallow razor blades. The next band, Lumerians, were pretty dope but I wasn't in the mood to hear anybody but Garotas Suecas, since that's who I came to see. They brought the fuzzy spaced out funk straight from Sao Paulo son! I met the guitarist who was real cool and he gave me the set-list (I'm such a nerd). Rickshaw's a dope venue coz it's got a nice sized main floor and the extra-dope upstairs with a balcony that has a perfect view of the stage, if you don't feel like punching out the next idiot who steps in front of you after you've been posted up front waiting for the band you been wanting to see. Real talk! Why does that shit always happen though.Big up to Chris the security guy for being a real genuine dude! I got nothin' but respect for security guys who hold it down without being douchey, nah mean? Chris is cool, and so is the O.G. cat checkin' i.d.'s (sorry, I didn't get his name but if you go here, you know who I'm talkin' bout). Keep doing what y'all Rickshaw Stop!"

It was only about 30 minutes and only the very basic moves were taught. At the end of the night I didn't feel like I have learned much about the dance at all. The music was fun. I have not been exposed to Indian Hip Hop much so I didn't know what to expect. The music was surprisingly easy to dance to. The dance floor was really stuffy especially when after it got really crowded later the night. The water dispenser was a life saver."

    "review": "I had the worst New Years Eve of my life because of this venue. My completely sober 125 pound boyfriend was standing to the side waiting for Glass Candy to go on while me friend and I were chatting with each other. We each payed about 45 bucks each, a heafty amount for a venue like the Rickshaw Stop, just to see the band play, then leave and go to friend's parties.Some guy rudely bumps my boyfriend to move, despite the amount of space around him that the guy could walk through easily. Then the guy tells him to walk outside with him because he was a sercurity guy. My boyfriend refused at first because they guy was going to kick him out then agreed to sort out what was going on. They go outside and the guy walks away. My boyfriend walks back in confused then the guy picks him up and forcibly carries him outside (RE-bruising an old rib injury my boyfriend had last year). This all happens AT MIDNIGHT.I'm demanding to see the manager and demanding for my money back. What could a 125 pound, well behaved man do to get him kicked out? Standing still isn't grounds to kick someone out. He wasn't drunk (like everyone else), he wasn't high (everyone else was) and he definitely wasn't harrassing people. All he did was refuse to move when someone was rudely pushing him instead of simply tapping him like everyone else does at a show.  The \"manager\" caves after listening to me complain about how his worker is bullying my boyfriend who is clearly sober, no threat and the last person to pick a fight with. He even agreed that my boyfriend didn't look like a threat. The worker even LIED and said that he did tap him on the shoulder to make it sound like his actions were justifiable. We think he was pissed about something unrelated and just wanted to pick on someone smaller than him.Me and my boyfriend have been coming to this venue since we were teens (between 10-14 years). Between us, we have gone to hundreds of shows over the years without any drama and we have NEVER been kicked out of any venue.We are tempted to go back to the venue and tell them that they re-injured my boyfriend's rib. We are also seriously considering talking to the owners about this (we know people who know them). I feel like we spent 90 bucks between us just to have a shitty time at their venue.We used to love this place. It used to be awesome where you could watch indie bands play. This was pre-Blow Up club nights when it really was about listening to good music and not about getting wasted, watching girls do tons of coke in the bathroom and where the people who worked there didn't pick on the wrong people."

This is my first, I made an account JUST to review BLOW UP @ The Rickshaw Stop.I went this Friday with a few friends. Had a TERRIBLE time. We're all in our early twenties but I felt like I was at a high school dance. HALF of the people there were children. Wasted, drugged, annoying, rude, obnoxious high schoolers. How do these kids get in?!It was Blow Up's \"100th Anniversary\" or something. It started off with some HORRIBLE 'performance' by two rapping lesbians. They were terrible. Despite the boos, they finished their act.I can't count the number of times I was pushed, shoved, and ran into without acknowledgment. At one point my friend and I were dance-attacked by some savage teenage girl on E. I had to push this bitch off of me numerous times!! Gays, forget it. I've been here about a dozen times and have never met any nice gays worth knowing. Oh, and I can never tell who's straight and who's hipster. HIPSTERS. Oh god! Don't get me started. So many weird, wanna-be indie hipster kids. So many v-necks, lense-less thick framed glasses, and skinny jeans, I wanted to kill myself.Also, if you DO happen to be underage and drinking, watch out. The bouncers here are ROUGH. I witnessed one of the male bouncers SCREAMING in this girls face after catching her drinking without a wrist band. He was yelling at the top of his lungs and screaming profanities for her to get out. And then a long brown-hair female worker there (bartender? female bouncer?) GRABS THIS GIRL BY THE THROAT and pushes her to get out. I couldn't believe what I was witnessing! Hardcore stuff.So yeah, in a nut shell. Don't waste your time on Blow Up. The ONLY saving grace of this event is the music... Not going to lie, its the only reason I lasted longer than an hour... Love the tunes! Oh, and if you go with some easy-going friends who love to dance.. you might be ok."

I'm talking, you better be wearing your good deoderant/antiperspirant. None of that crystal stuff. b.) You have to have your dancing shoes on. Read: flats, sneakers...NO heels. c.) You have to expect your clothes to smell like cigarettes. Although, there is a smoking area upstairs, the smoke makes its way downstairs. So why was I surprised that I left my rainjacket underneath the lit christmas tree downstairs to find that it completely stunk of cigarette smoke? d.) You have to expect to be somewhat sore the next day...that and maybe a combination of sore and hungover. PLUSES:-I have never been disappointed. I have been to Blow Up, Cockblock and Rebel Girl. All great nights. Great music. Interesting people.-$5 tequila sunrise. Bar upstairs and downstairs. Not sure what the variety is like upstairs. -Upstairs, there's plenty of space to lounge around or just stand next to the railing. Please don't jump off.-Great photo ops. -When you go to 18+ events, you can find yourself as one of very few people getting drinks. Not much of a wait. Awesome.-Ins and outs allow for some breathing roomMINUS:-Please do something about the floor in front of the bar. That area is slippery as all hell. There really should be someone mopping/drying that area down. -18+ events, watch out for hot messes EVERYWHERE. You can tolerate this more when you have had 2+ drinks in you. You'll (almost) forget that they have pacifiers and glow sticks...again, almost.All in all, I never hesitate to come here. :)"

True, lots of 18+ kids who party here probably attend the local art school wearing their most expensive & trendiest outfit that mom and pop financed but if you ease up a bit most of them are just looking to get to know others with the same interest. It's what some would call a 'hipster' scene, but who cares? That doesn't stop most people from partying in SJ's Motif or Suite 181 when I call it the 'ghetto' scene.Expect the young, fabulous, trendy, tattooed & pierced type here! If you don't like this type, then obviously don't come here to ruin everyone else's good time with your negativity and sniveling. What I love about partying here for Blow UP is they constantly have different artists & DJ's coming here to bring you some fresh indie & electronica beats to dance to  a la Steve Aoki, Dan Oh, Skeet Skeet, Designer Drugs, Micky Avalon, etc. Richie Panic & Jeffrey Paradise are the usual DJ suspects here.Once when I came here with friends during the summer it was so hot we literally left the place drenched in sweat. I know it wasn't the weather that evening, but rather it was caused by everyone's dancing and enjoying themselves.Definitely worth it imo. Don't forget to say \"Hi!\" to Ava Berlin, she is such a sweetie!"

It's actually pretty hard and some people need to learn to wear more deodorant. As you know, bhangra requires lots of arms up in the air and I smelled lots of BO. EwieAll in all it was fun.

I don't have to tell you that more than one of those can be dangerous!!They also have a projector screen that they play videos on. It sits up on the stage, which you can dance on right by the DJ.The upstairs is cool as well. They have couches and a balcony area that looks over the dance floor that's nice to sit at when you need a dance break. Free foosball table, coat check and another bar as well.

The only issue I have with this place is that the music felt very repetitive: a friend described himself as \"feeling as though [he] were listening to 20 minutes of one track, then 3 minutes of another track, and then 20 more minutes of the first track.\" The Tenderlions were playing, and it was a joy to watch them, but listening got old quickly.

Knowing that I can come here on Fridays to blow off some steam and burn about a billion calories dancing and sweating for a few hours is the only thing that gets me through the week some times. It's $15 for 18+ and $10 for 21+, and well worth it at that.Jeffrey Paradise and Richie Panic are the resident DJ's and are a couple of the cities finest. Let me make one thing clear: Yes, this is an 18+ club, yes this means there are a fair amount of 18-20 year olds there, NO this does not ruin the club experience. This is a hip club. Meaning it's mainly a bunch of hip-kids decked out in American Apparel, Urban Outfitters, and/or various thrift/vintage shop clothing. It wouldn't matter if these kids were 16 or 30, they all act the same.If you're looking for a lounge to sip cocktails and relax, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU. If you're looking a wall to wall dance floor to 'blow up and get down' while getting absolutely soaked in your own (and everyone else's, mind you) sweat, this is your new mecca.

Apart from that, no outstanding or horrendous things to mention that immediately come to mind.** Recently went here this past Friday, September 4th to see The Twelves @ Loaded, supported by the Tenderlions with DJs Omar, Aaron and Sleazemore also spinning. SHIT WAS CRAZY! I kid you not! Once we were in around 10pm, as soon as people started getting inside, they were pumped and ready to get down, busting out moves randomly, psyched for the night ahead. As people got comfortable inside and had some drinkies, the party was jumping way before the Tenderlions and Twelves even came on! At the end, a bunch of people, myself included ahah, got up on stage and started grooving right along with the Twelves. Saying that it was just a good night would be an understatement.**Entertainment for the night apart from the music?- A somewhat attractive, almost Casey-Affleck look-alike, drunk French hipster who was not pretentious! but rather like I said, just very drunk later on. He did not trust his friends with hats very much and knew how to bust a move...sober.- London-native wannabe playa who was the French guy's friend although he was kind of funny to talk to."

It's got a pretty large open area with a nice sized stage which allows you to listen to music. Which is it's purpose. So yea, I guess that's a solid 3 stars right, simply functioning as intended with no real stand out qualities?The drinks were mediocre, yet another 3 star designation, again nothing to really flip out about. They have coat check which is a plus. Many events are all ages or 18+ which generally I avoid like the plague, but I'm two for two on not being completely over run by any rabid groups of annoying kids.That's all I got. Boring huh? Not my fault they didn't inspire me to write anything else... If a show is going on here that you want to see then hell yea, Rickshaw works, I just wouldn't make a spontaneous jaunt here."

But I went last night to see the Lovemakers and it was most certainly NOT fine.  I felt sick when I got there, so spent most of the opening band sitting and trying to feel better so I could stay with my friends (I was the DD).  I was cuddling with my friend on the couch and had a hand over my eyes to sort of meditate and feel better when the bouncer came up and told me i'd have to leave if i wasn't \"more energetic.\" i thought he was joking, but he came back 10 minutes later and said \"i saw you napping, i'm going to ask you to leave.  the boss said that's not ok.\"  i replied incredulously \"what?\" and he said \"did i stutter?\"  i told him i wasn't feeling well and he said \"that's too bad but i'm still going to kick you out if you don't start showing some more energy.\"WTF? since when is a club a pep rally?i suspect that they are running a shady deal where they pack their club past capacity, then pick out people to throw out for whatever reason so they can keep their money but not be *too* packed.don't worry, mr bouncer, i'll never darken your club with my floopiness again."

One of my friends got sick while she was there (and all she had to drink was a ginger ale in this hot and stuffy club). She sat down on the couch by the merch table to take a short break, but apparently 'the boss' didn't like this. One of the employees came by--a stocky bald guy with terrible facial hair--and said that she wasn't being \"energetic enough.\"  My friend told him that she was getting sick and just resting for a second.  Rather than offering her some water, he said that he was going to \"kick her out if she wasn't more energetic.\"  The douchiest part: she said \"I'm sorry, what did you say?\" and he did a poor Bender impression and said \"did I stutter?\"I hope that the next time he gets sick and needs medical assistance, he only gets quotes from John Hughes' movies.Read all the other 1-star reviews, and you'll see that I'm not alone in this opinion.  I saw another bouncer throwing more people out tonight than I've seen at all the times I've been out at clubs in SF.I suspect it's a scam: the club was filled way past its legally allowed capacity (it's posted on the wall), and I think they throw people out so they can keep their money and pretend that they comply with the fire laws.Hopefully a fire marshall will show up one night, shut this place down, and put these douchebags their out of a job.  It's a shame because the bartenders seemed pretty nice."

Doors were supposed to open at 9pm, but the line was still moving pretty slowly to get in; but major props to the ID checker at the front for trying, constantly screaming for everyone to get their IDs out and ready. Upon entering, you might have to fight through the bathroom queue to get anywhere. Ceilings are pretty low, but don't worry they shouldn't cave in--just keep walking, get your drinks and shake that thang! What I loved about the venue, was wether upstairs, downstairs, bathroom or bar, the ambiance was very home-y, almost an intimate gathering of friends (don't worry, I'm not an emo or a hipster). Drinks were awesome: great Tokyo Iced Tea. AND woot woot for the upstairs smoking room! The openers were fun--they really got the audience going. Then Ms. Diva Sovereign managed to get through four songs before walking off for a second and final time. Needless to say, everyone tried making the best of the situation, but one of the guards did not like it when a friend walked on stage and grabbed the rest of the Diva's crate of beer (Dos XX's but free is free). I understand that the Diva just wasn't feeling it, but come on. So, the jerk of a guard huffed and puffed and through us all out, even though the DJ said everyone could split her beer. Still managed to have an awesome time though. Glad/Proud we got kicked out of a place we no longer wanted to be. So, to reiterate, Yay for Rickshaw and poo on the Lady Sovereign (you should put that in your pipe and smoke it before your next show you sorry twit--oops, might still be a bit angry with her)."

It admittedly was one of those record-breaking-temperature April days, but even still -- they need to install some fans at a minimum.  Better, a full A/C system.

    "review": "I have never been treated so unjustifiably poorly by the staff of any establishment in my life. The behavior of the employees here Saturday night was honestly shocking and really took me aback.Let me preface this by saying I was not that drunk. I know that sounds like the \"drunk girl's motto\" but I was very clear headed when dealing with the staff. Now, I had been dancing in the middle of the club with a friend, who, to put it simply, dropped me and I fell hard in front of everyone. I mean hard. Super embarrassing and probably made me look a lot drunker than I actually was. After my moment in the spotlight, I scurried away to the bar to avoid the stares, and that's when the fun started. I went to get my 2nd drink of the night (the first of which I shared with my friend), and essentially got cut off. He probably saw my fall. He didn't even say this, or anything for that matter, and when I asked for a drink he basically scoffed and said \"don't think that's happening,\" turned his back, and ignored me. I didn't understand what was going on.But whatever, it wasn't that big of deal and I didn't make a fuss. When I came back later in the night to close my tab (for the 1 drink I had bought), I asked him if he really thought I had been that drunk, to which he responded, \"yeah, drunk or on roofies, something is going on.\" Who says that? It was the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard, and he was clearly just trying to be insulting. When I asked him what his name was, I again got the silent treatment, and he went in the back room. The other bartender was also ignoring me and nobody would give any names. Maybe they knew I'd write a bad review? If you're going to treat somebody like shit, man up and give them your name.The place was closing down, and having been there with the band, I was waiting on the stairs for them to get the car and load up. You know the face that women make, and that tone of voice, where someone is pretending to say something nicely but really they are trying to be really mean? Kind of a like a little tilt of the head/smirk/raised eyebrows look? This little asian chick employee comes over to me (I'm donig absolutely nothing) and tells me I need to leave in the rudest way, with that face. I told her I was with the band and that I was just waiting for them, and she essentially said, again in a really venomous way, that she didn't care who I was with, I needed to get out. To which I replied, \"fine but you don't have to be such a bitch about it.\" Yes yes, I know I should've just held my tongue, and I am generally quite tame, but it was the culmination of the entire staff marking me and treating me like !@#$ for the duration of the night that did it. Of course she, and the 3 other employees at the bar immediately start screaming at me, 'YOU need to get the !@#$ out of this club NOW!\" Which, at that point, was warranted.And here is how you know it wasn't just me. The guys were loading up the van in front of the club, at 2:25 or so, and one of the angry bartenders (who was leaving to go home, not knowing that I was in the car), yells at one of the band members for parking in front of the club and having all of their shit around. He tells him to have some respect. HE'S PACKING UP! He just finished a show! It was crazy.It's unfortunate that the staff (at least, I guess, on a saturday) is so horrendously rude because otherwise the space as a music venue is not bad at all."

It's right up my alley.Some of the crew and I rolled out deep for Non Stop Bhangra night at Rickshaw stop. Walking in, we were a few early, which was just fine. We got our drinks, posted up in the corner and put on our dancing shoes, ready to be taught some of the elegantly simple and artfully infused dance moves that are, well, Bhangra. I had never heard of it before, although I had seen that style many times in Paris. Nights flew by listening to raj music while in underground clubs by the Louvre as the locals went mad. The people that frequent the small club with an upstairs are die hards. It was incredible to see the different flavors of people jam packed in there literally letting it all go and getting their groove on. I sweated through my clothing, and for once, wished I had worn kicks instead of heels so that I could have really gotten down and dirty in it. No drama, no problems, just a ton of people all there with a common thread, they love to dance. The beat inspires them. What could be more perfect than that? I didn't get skeevy men dripping on my ass for once, no one attempting to take the two of us home that night. It was refreshing. Just make sure you're not claustrophobic, as it's as tightly packed in there late at night as sardines in a can.

    "review": "Note: This review is more a review of a particular club night, maybe not on the establishment itself. In my experience the people that work at the Rickshaw Stop are great people, it just seems like its something about the Blow Up promoters that get under my skin and here is why: It was pretty dead earlier in the night but soon the trying-to-hard-hipsters started to make their way in. The DJ was moderately good the entire night but much to arrogant. Its hilarious watching these young girls hang on to these guys like rockstars. They didn't like the fact that I went up to them and asked them to play a song. Okay DJ's maybe you don't have to play it, maybe you don't want to play it, but don't be an ass a simple \"I'll try to get it in there\" would be awesome. Don't be a pretentious fuck just because I'm not a coked out whore asking to blow you.The more packed it got the more the temperature started to rise. It becomes unbearable by midnight. I was with a group of friends but I instantly noticed how people here are not as friendly as I have encountered at other places.It also took way to long to get a drink at the bar which surprised me because on other nights I would be served rather quickly.So, on Blow Up nights, the standard for this place is lowered. It becomes much to chaotic and the people who run it don't seem to care about the patrons. However, the crowd doesn't seem to care how they are treated for the most part either. The young kids, some probably with fake id's, are much more concerned with getting their picture taken making out with a stranger or with their left nipple hanging out.Maybe I am just much to old for this?I def want to attend a Cockblock or other gay/lez night and hopefully make up for the experience on this night."

We had pre paid for tickets and stood in line for just a few minutes. We walked in and could feel the excitement. The actual venue is not Schick or sophisticated. Its simplistic, retro, and very functional. You walk and see  a bar on your right. On the left stair stairs lead up to another bar and more seating. We quickly and easily got our drinks from the 1st floor bar. From that point we walked straight into a huge open room. One end was the stage. We made our way to the side of the room and were able to score a low table to put our drinks and jackets on (and later stand and dance on).The band rocked. Everyone was in a great mood. No one was worried about appearances or glam. Everyone here was mellow. I SSSOOO appreciated being able to go out in just a t shirt (a fancy one) jeans and chucks. We danced and jumped all around all night.Bottom line. Fair drink prices. Friendly Staff. No dress code. PRICELESS!!!"

    "review": "*This review is for Friday Nights and Blow Up*18nUP? It's been years, and I mean YEARS since I've been to such an event but I sucked it up for a friend's birthday. I was plesantly surprized because I ended up having a good time. The whole place reminded me of High School! Not in a bad way, and no, not because I was a couple of years older than the majority of the folks there but because of the setup and decor. The venue set-up reminded me of a HS auditorium because it's a widely spacious dance floor that faces a stage. There's also an upstairs bar + balcony with vintage decorations like old school bikes and 80s looking tables. The crowd was dressed uber trendy. For some reason I noticed a lot of boys in fashionable hats. A good handful of girlies were wearing party or cocktail dresses. Their best threads for the friday night school dance. I keed, they all looked cute, I swear!Electric music. Heard some Kanye, 80s, brit pop, and other uppity beats while I was there. I love dancing to it! Anything goes, and ANYONE can dance to it. Folks were wyling out and letting themselves go to the beats. Good for them for enjoying themselves! Drinks weren't bad: $3 for beer and $6 for wine. Contrary to other reviews, the bartenders aren't jerks either. Don't think I'd come back by choice but Rickshaw is okay in my book."

It's so worth it just to listen to the dope DJ's spin some sick songs you've never heard.The only reason I don't give this place 5-stars is because it's an 18+ place. If it were 21+ then it would be perfect."

No pictures, not even the ones they take of themselves will do Rickshaw justice. The lighting and visual was fantastic but I don't recommend getting too shit faced unless you wanna give the people waiting in line a good show (on stupidity). Been to a few clubs now, and have been to neko to go on stage but this time some stranger just pulled me up and I had a blast. AMAZING in comparison to Club X. Like my friend explained, trashy people go where trashy people are, regardless of the club. Blow up is lucky to have down to earth cool people. Had NO problem whatsoever about the space issue, I like that so it works for me. Guys were tasteful and I was never surprised with a random bulge humping my backside like Club X.DEFF going back. deff."

The place is rather drab looking when the seizure lights aren't all over the place, the bar is nice, and I quite adore the smoking room. Blow Up is always crazy packed and if you haven't seen the collections at American Apparel, then come here. $15 for 18+ and $10 for 21+. The music is pretty good, really crammed, and sweaty. I've started to really like going out dancing and this is place is reliably fun with the right group of friends."

I gotta get my dirtying dancing on sometime, but since there ain't no Havana Nights to speak of, Rickshaw does just fine.The crowd is pretty mixed here, but I always have a good time. It's always about the crowd of people you bring with you though. Just dance like no one's watching (save the photographers and video recording). They play some pretty sick mixes here so I've been here again and again.It would be accurate to say that this is a hipster hotspot on Blow Up nights, but it's not like you're out of place because I'm mos def not a hipster.

They were able to squeeze our 2 hour film screening party on a Saturday- which is very hard to do.  My top reasons why you should go there:1. Bartenders are quick and slick.2. They offer my favorite pear cider there. 3. If you love live music- this is the place to go.4. The people are mixed, hip, and good-looking5. If you are short, and cannot make it to the front, there is an upstairs floor where you can lounge on sofas and watch the show.6.

But seemed like most of the people there were regulars and for the most part knew each other.  This is a non-profit organization supporting local bay area artists. However, the audience was not very diverse.  As a Black American, I couldn't help but notice there were fewer than 10 Black people in the room, including the singer (we actually counted about 8).  We arrived just at 7:30 pm when the show started, so we didn't try the food.  But there was a separate area near the entrance where you could order and pick up your food and beverages and bring to your table.  We ordered a bottle of rose that was pretty good, and reasonably priced.  There was no table service, which was fine considering what you got with the cover charge, which was 3 hours of live performance.We had the pleasure of listening to Chloe Jean who was phenomenal. If all the artists are of her caliber, I'll definitely go back again and again.  If you don't mind this place not being very diverse, I highly recommend."

The owner Karen, an appropriate name for sure, claimed she had no choice. I said their is always a choice. She offered to refund my $$ for the tickets and I said no since I had already purchased food and drinks.The refund wasn't the issue, the issue was selling me a table for two and adding unknown/unwanted people because the performer wanted it.Then before the show started, they moved us to a table for 2 in the back by the bathroom door.  They should have moved the people at my table since I paid for it and they didn't... Won't be returning Karen....P.S the one star is for the food. It was very good."

Now fast forward to this time of financial difficulty...and they have again stepped up. Now they are offering live stream shows.

    "review": "On June 30, 2017 I had the delight of hearing new music by the Fred Randolph Quintet at the Sound Room on 2147 Broadway at Grand. They played with the intensity of true professionals at the top of their game. Their sound is as fresh and diverse as Cachao or Miles Davis in the 70's. The band featured Fred Randolph, on bass; Erik Jekabson, trumpet; Sheldon Brown, sax and alto sax and flute; Greg Wyser-Pratte, drums; and Dan Zemelman, piano.   My favorite piece was entitled, \"Song with no Singer\" and was inspired by Salif Keita and aptly had neither lyrics nor a singer. The hosts Karen and her quieter husband, Robert, were wonderful storytellers and I was able to order bruschetta with cheese and figs and tapas of olives and peppers, for nine dollars!  The scene was intimate and my friend and  I shared a table with a nice Dad and daughter duo from Portland, Maine. If the Sound Room is at capacity with 55 souls it feels packed. The lighting and sound were impeccable and the temperature in the room was warm. It was a memorable show, which makes us wonder what this talented composer, Randolph and his quintet will have in their repertoire for next show's set on August 2nd, which is in Walnut Creek."

I'm thousands of miles away from The Sound Room and have never been there - I just wanted to get a gift for my sister, who lives near it in Oakland. There's a phone number on the website that I tried a bunch of times, but no one ever picked up. I emailed and got a reply running through some gift options that weren't quite what I was looking for, and the note that \"we do check messages frequently and return calls if contact info is left on the recording.\"So I said I would call and got an emailed reiteration of the same options from the earlier email. When I called and left a message ...\u00a0it was never returned.(The email from The Sound Room explained: \"We are a non-profit run on volunteer labor. Our presence at the Sound Room is focused around scheduled shows.\" But I left *more than a month* between leaving my message and giving up. I figured even \"volunteer labor\" could make a phone call *guaranteed* to bring in money, given several weeks in which to do it.)So instead of giving several hundred dollars to The Sound Room, I surrendered and gave it directly to my sister. Much less fun and surprising. And she's now planning summer travel, so I don't think much of that money will wind up going to this nonprofit.The Sound Room can do what it wants, how it wants. But if they're going to put a phone number on a website, why not, you know, let people use the phone?"

    "review": "Going to a jazz lounge, having drinks, and enjoying great music has always been a dream of mine, and I was happy that my first experience happened at The Sound Room. I purchased the V.I.P tickets for only ten dollars more than the regular ticket price. That extra ten dollars got us into the club a half hour early, giving us time to buy drinks and food, as well as get priority seating. They opened their doors promptly at seven, so we didn't have to wait too long in the rain. While waiting in line to get checked in, I couldn't help but notice the food at the counter. It was glowing, and even though I was here for the show, my stomach needed to be appeased first. The food was very affordable, much more than I thought it would be. For two Moulin Rouge drinks (champagne, hibiscus, and ginger), a cheese plate, a crostini with pecan pate and mushrooms, a lavash roll, and a shrimp skewer, I paid $40.00. Everything tasted great. We also indulged in their version of spinach dip, which looked good, but lacked in flavor. Enough about the food. The real show is the actual show, which was everything I wanted it to be. The room is fairly small, only seating 70 people, and every seat is the best seat in house. The small room crams everyone together, but you abandon any sense of claustrophobia once the show starts. The show for the night was performed by Marina Crouse and Garth Webber, along with their band. The music they play is like no other. I have always been a fan of Jazz and Blues, but to hear it live is a whole other experience. The music was very soulful. It made me truly listen to what's being played, what's being sung, and the stories that are being told. The band was full of life, especially the drummer, and the vibe was just incredibly warm and fun. The venue is small, making the sound incredible. The staff are incredible as well, especially the owner, who clearly has a passion for this type of music. Even the other patrons are incredible. While we were waiting in the rain, at least four different people offered to share their umbrellas with us. The Sound Room has it's usual members, and it's clear they are a tight knit family, but no one made us feel unwelcome or left out. Parking can be a bit of a hassle, so I would recommend arriving early, so you have ample time to find a spot. Overall, I can't thank The Sound Room enough for providing me with a very pleasant first experience into this world of live Jazz and Blues."

(had to use the word) definitely could not figure out how he did most of his tricks. he was a great entertainer!Jazz was nice, and singers were good too. They know their craft for sure. definitely more of an older crowd there though, so I wasnt feeling the atmosphere so much. cool that the ticket sales were going to charity!wine tasting had weird timing, slow at first and then rushed towards the middle and end. Their white wines tasted much better than their reds, which was a bummer because im more a fan of reds.Super yucky & stale & tasteless & overpriced appetizers.

Mostly jazz - played at a high level  - with performers old and new, in styles from Dixieland to Avant Garde. This is a friendly and truly intimate setting, with a casual, but always interesting and delicious, collection of tapas and other small plates - almost all vegetarian or vegan.  They also offer a small selection of well-priced, usually local, beers and wine.  Recently, The Sound Room has begun featuring Flamenco performances - dance, guitar, rhythms,  and songs. These shows usually draw from the deep and excellent Bay Area flamenco community, which I'm told is among the best - outside of Spain and Mexico.  Occasionally, Spanish visitors perform.  Great to sit so close to these dramatic dancers.The Sound Room is only two or three years old, now. --  a nonprofit organization dedicated to jazz and its local performers and audience.  I feel lucky that these people came to Oakland to bring us music at this intimate scaler."

A small and intimate venue, where no seat is a bad seat, since you're up close to the performers.This happens to be a non-profit that is entirely operational due to the love and dedication of volunteers. All the proceeds from the ticket sales go straight to the artists. Proceeds from food/drink offerings and your donations keep the lights (and sound) ON! The ticket prices are very reasonable, so do consider enjoying a small bite/drink from their kitchen. They have a decent offering of libations (wine/beer/non-alcoholic) and hors d'oeuvres. If nothing else, for love of music!!Tip: Since this is a volunteer run venue, please be patient with them, as they may sometimes be stretched thin! Go a bit early, so as to give yourself some time to grab a drink, and locate a table/seating of your liking. Talk to the volunteers, they're fellow music lovers. Stay back after the show and talk/mingle with the artists. Make a great evening off the event."

Often 120 db for a Jazz Sextet playing intricate composotions, Great musicians and compositions ruined by over amping and low fidelity eqjipment.Forthe  second set the sound man left the board on while connecting the new band. A loose connection in Sheldon Browns rig caused explosive snapping crackling and popping at a deafening volume for at least 45 seconds before the ear assault ended. This sent everyones hands to their ears and as I kooked around it looked like Edvard Munchs Painting the \"Scream!\"!!  In all directions.!!!!  Could be a nice venue with a professjonal sound man with a quality board.To the owners you have a very live room only the piano needs a mic. The Bass brings hi own.Everyone else should be amped for balance not volume. A sextet shouldnt sound lime a marching band. You should hear the instruments sound come from the instruments not the monitors and side speakers . Also the low quality amp does not allow the subtelies of tone through that are generated by the grear musicians wjo play at your venue. You the owner or manager need to take responsibility for the volume musicians and sound men tend to have lost significant hearing and really cant be the best judges in this matter.you no its loud when the flute needs the monitor turned up necause theh cant heare them selves over the band.!!!"

    "review": "The Starry Plough is a good neighborhood bar with great fries, but the set up for events and other food can be a bit meh.I came in on a Wednesday night for a veggie burger from my nearby hotel and had no idea where to order or how things worked since it was more of a bar than a place to eat. Thankfully a very friendly bartender saw my bewilderment and helped me out by directing me to the far counter with the register where I could order. There was a hockey game on TV and I think background music. The Irish was all over the walls and other than bar seating, there were a few tables and chairs.My food came out pretty quick, but I was the first to order before a ton of people showed up for the poetry slam later on and they looked like they had a wait. The veggie burger was black bean and I think quinoa based, but had so much jalapeno in it I found it mostly inedible (was pretty hungry so I had just a small amount of patty and lots of bread, leaving 3/4 of the patty on the plate). The fries were on-point! Loved the crisp, skin on fries, but didn't appreciate the dregs of the bag being included (little strips of fried potato skin). While the poetry slam was advertised for 8pm, which I waited for and then passed, it still hadn't started by 8:35 and I gave up. The lady in front collecting funds noted they should have started already, as 8:30 is more typical but I had to get going with my night and the organizer was not looking like it was going to get started for a bit despite expectation setting with announcements. They had placed a bunch of chairs in front of their stage, which were mostly filled by the time I left, so popular event for sure. Unfortunately the sound people didn't really know appropriate levels for 10-15 minutes and the bass made me sick to my stomach.Good fries, beers and popular events await you at the Starry Plough, but come prepared for waits and maybe stay away from the veggie burger if you can't handle the inferno."

Baby Santa is also a well-known performer here with his steel guitar, duck-dynasty like hair, and some slap-knee lyrics you've surely never heard. This place even serves Kombucha, in fact the strongest grapefruit Kombucha I've ever tried!"

    "review": "The Starry Plough is a good neighborhood bar with great fries, but the set up for events and other food can be a bit meh.I came in on a Wednesday night for a veggie burger from my nearby hotel and had no idea where to order or how things worked since it was more of a bar than a place to eat. Thankfully a very friendly bartender saw my bewilderment and helped me out by directing me to the far counter with the register where I could order. There was a hockey game on TV and I think background music. The Irish was all over the walls and other than bar seating, there were a few tables and chairs.My food came out pretty quick, but I was the first to order before a ton of people showed up for the poetry slam later on and they looked like they had a wait. The veggie burger was black bean and I think quinoa based, but had so much jalapeno in it I found it mostly inedible (was pretty hungry so I had just a small amount of patty and lots of bread, leaving 3/4 of the patty on the plate). The fries were on-point! Loved the crisp, skin on fries, but didn't appreciate the dregs of the bag being included (little strips of fried potato skin). While the poetry slam was advertised for 8pm, which I waited for and then passed, it still hadn't started by 8:35 and I gave up. The lady in front collecting funds noted they should have started already, as 8:30 is more typical but I had to get going with my night and the organizer was not looking like it was going to get started for a bit despite expectation setting with announcements. They had placed a bunch of chairs in front of their stage, which were mostly filled by the time I left, so popular event for sure. Unfortunately the sound people didn't really know appropriate levels for 10-15 minutes and the bass made me sick to my stomach.Good fries, beers and popular events await you at the Starry Plough, but come prepared for waits and maybe stay away from the veggie burger if you can't handle the inferno."

Don't to this bar.  The local children run amok, screaming and running all l we threw place. It just shows how fucking stupid and clueless these people are. I can't wait to see how your chidden turn out with your direction. If it was my Pub, it give you a warning  and then cut you off. It's OK to have a locAl pub, but to be successful you need to create a welcoming en environment . If you let a couple millennial parent , who are oblivious of child-rearing run a-mock, you completely destroy your brand."

But one day I wanted both food and a beer, and Starry Plough popped up in my good ol' Yelp app, so I figured why not. Turns out what I had envisioned this place to be was a little far off. Yes, there are Irish themes (and actual Irish clientele), but also a variety of other folks (I'm assuming from the neighborhood) who frequent this cozy little spot. Since then I've came in a few times for happy hour, and have tried a couple food items. Earlier today, I had a regular ol' cheeseburger, and I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. The patty was seasoned and charred just right and the homemade mayo was a perfect accent. I'm not a pickle person, but even those were really nice! I'd come back for that alone."

Sweaty and kind of drunk, I told my friend, \"When I move to SF I'm coming here every week.\"It turned out that was more like \"three or four times a year\" since it's a bit of a commute, but each time I do I enjoy myself, even if it's just to sit and have a pint by myself and let my thoughts of the day settle.The place has character, and atmosphere, and ambiance. By which I mean, \"They don't blast background music so you have to scream at your friend next to you just to be heard.\" Pubs like The Starry Plough are hard to find; it doesn't have bland, Instagram-worthy trendiness, it just has class and comfort. I find myself enjoying small-talk and conversations with the stranger next to me. It's been a shining jewel for the last fifty years, and I hope it continues so for the next five hundred."

However, I was recently here twice in a matter of just a few days. Once for a low key dinner on a funk Thursday and one for Fleetwood Macrame, a Fleetwood Mac cover band.They have live music every night here. Thursday is the only night where the is no cover. The DJ was spinning some tunes early on and we left before the band, but dinner was good! The fish and chips were solid, not too flavorful, but thick cuts of battered fish perfectly fried with freshly cut and fried potatoes. The roasted vegetables with homemade pesto were delicious! Great beer selection (only beer and wine here).The cover band was a $15 cover, and that was way too pricey. Although fun, the band was dece and I'm not quite sure was worth the $15 and spending a ton on drinks. I discussed with friends and we all agreed - $8, $10 tops is the most one should pay for an average cover band at a bar/venue.I think I may be more of a preshow drinks and eats local here unless that band is really enticing me to pony up the dough. But for that early evening beer and burger, The Starry Plough is a no brainer!"

The fries were a bit soggy, there was about an inch of oil at the bottom, and I'm not sure where the gravy was (bits of bacon were good). He ate about half and left the rest (very unlike him). I had the quinoa burger and fries extra crispy (after asking the cashier if she recommended it (which she enthusiastically did) and making sure she wasn't a vegan (I'm sorry, but I feel they often have lower standards for veggie food b/c of their restrictions)). The extra crispy fries had a great color, but were not crispy. The burger was below average. The bun was nice, but they put mayo on both sides (I'm not a fan and didn't expect it to be put on for me). The quinoa burger was mushy, not great tasting and fell apart. My snakebite tasted watery and was not carbonated. I really wish this place had tastier food as we would have loved to make this our place. The table next to us had 5 people sharing a pizza and they left more than half... that should have been a sign. The staff was very nice though."

We knew that the atm in the bar charges a fee, so we called ahead to see if we could add the cover charge to our tab. The man that answered the phone said it would be no problem! But once we got to the pub, we were told that that was \"in no way possible\" and that \"someone must have been trained wrong or something.\" Honestly, getting cash last minute wouldn't have been such a big deal if the bartenders and woman letting people in weren't so rude to us. In an aggressive and abrasive tone, we were told to either pay or leave and they were in no way apologetic for spreading misinformation. It definitely seemed that they thought we had made up the whole thing, which we had no reason to do. Asking for clarification on something we took the initiative to inquire about earlier in the night, should not merit disrespect. We turned around and are never coming back."

It was cooked perfectly and it was huge! I can honestly say it was the best burger I've ever had. Full of flavor and juicy! Garlic fries are to die for as well. The staff was super friendly and had a lot of patience. I asked a lot of questions while I was debating on what to order. The dining room had a lot of space and the bathroom was clean.

The dining area reeked of wintergreen.  Extremely strong, overpowering smell.  If I had not already ordered and paid for my food (and my friend's food) I would have left.  The odor ruined any chance of enjoying the food.  I think it was from a cleaning product.

Seemed like they were friends that do this often.We were originally planning to eat dinner here, but it turns out the kitchen was closed. Probably remodeling. That's too bad. We did enjoy a beer before heading to our next destination. They have a decent selection of beers, though I wasn't too thrilled about the cleanliness of the seating areas. It was a mediocre place to hang out. I wouldn't be thrilled about coming back here again, but I'm sure some customers have made The Starry Plough their regular, comfortable watering hole!"

We curiously entered the 'dive-bar-meets-Irish-pub', ordered beers and grabbed some pizza. The beer selection wasn't too great, with brews ranging between 'meh' to decent. The pizza, however, was not bad at all: tasty, cooked all the way through and nicely balanced out.

One time I ordered an apple bread pudding dessert and the entire bar was in awe with the amazing, glorious piece of culinary perfection they whipped up. As for the setting, the plough has the perfect \"casual, local bar\" vibe mixed with the exciting event atmosphere. It's rare to find a chill bar that simultaneously caters to the hardworking after-work drinking crowd as well as artists AND families. it's a nice feeling. Reminds me of home."

Their happy hour deals are not bad either as you can get a pint for $4 at that time. In terms of their bar food it is not more special than any other bar food with the usual things being offered like burgers, sandwiches, and mac and cheese. There is also only one TV that isn't accessible everywhere in the place but they're always playing the most relevant sports that day.What is really cool about this bar is that fairly frequently they have live bands perform and different shows. Usually the cover charge is $10 but that does also get you a beer. So if you are looking for something fun to do and like bars and small local bands I would definitely check this place out."

Because of that though, it's definitely a bar you go to when you're looking for social interaction and music, not when you're looking for somewhere to watch sports (there's only one TV). Food is average-above average bar food depending on what you order. I've had fish and chips there that were kind of bland and I've had mac and cheese with rosemary and a few kinds of cheese that was quite good. Happy hour is long which is a plus, but the deals aren't great which is a minus. You get a dollar off a drink but the drink has to be under $6 to begin with, which doesn't leave a great selection. Overall, not a bad place to go get a drink with friends but not my favorite."

After spending a great weekend with my best friend we ended the trip with a beer at the Starry Plough. The beer selection here was really solid. Not the best I've come across, but a solid B at least. There is enough of a variety to please everyone. The food was where they started to loose me. I ordered a nice salad, and it was meh. I know salads aren't generally seen as very sexy or fun, but we are in CA which is known for produce. The salad was also supposed to be seasonal, so I had high hopes for some fresh flavors. Everything just felt sort of flat and drab. Again, I know it is a salad and a poor choice to make, but it just did not live up to the potential I saw on the menu. The service was friendly enough and the atmosphere was very kid friendly. There were kids running around and dancing on the stage. Not super relaxing for the adults, but great for them.

I mainly go for the stouts but for some reason when one of my friends shared with me the pale ale here, it felt... Good. A word I usually don't associate with beer because my Chinese palate has averted my taste for a long time until this pub made me truly taste happiness.I rate this pub 5 for the social warmth and the fondness of tasting beer here.The food is okay... Sometimes it gets flat and there's too much of it, so I would t come here just for the eats."

Either put up a sign that the kitchen isn't ready until 2:30 or be ready when you open the place. Then the band began to tune up at 3pm and the squeaking/ volume testing was really hurtful on the ears. Liked the food but there's a lot of good competition out there."

The bathroom was old but very clean- we were there on Valentine's Day, early evening. I didn't much like the live music that night which I guess is the reason for 4 not 5 stars. But that's maybe not fair of me. I would return and hope I liked the music more."

We kept an eye on him to make sure he wasn't preparing our food. Turns out he was and we didn't see him wash his hands... ever. He cooked our pizza and then cut it into tiny quadrilaterals and triangles. Eating this pizza was one of the most awkward dining experiences I've ever had. To make matters worse, the pizza wasn't even good. The dough was undercooked and tasted like it was from a can.Prior to getting our food, we had to go to the bar to order drinks because drinks can't be ordered with food. We also had to wash the plates which were provided because they were dirty. The bands did an excessively long sound check 2 hours prior to the show - like they each played a few songs in their entirety. It was super loud and we were not able to talk during dinner."

His \"advice\" was to try what we already had done, which he would have known had he read the complaint. He was unaware of the MC's methods even though they were described for him. (See previous review).Asking him to take another look at the original complaint he was more than a little rude in his second reply. No apology, no \"I'll look into that\"; only swearing and \"advice\" that was not applicable.Also, after talking with the other two in my group, their food was bad unlike mine, so that's a gamble too."

Remembering how ppl often ask how I find such cool places, I must be honest and say that often times it is the energy that will pull you in. I visited on a Monday aka Dead-day (in the night life industry). Surprised to see a full house at 8pm. They were hosting Irish dancing lessons- How clever!- and fun. I enjoyed their Rotating Taps which included a number of local brews. (+4pts). They also have the standard Irish-bar beers on taps for those whom have married their brands.In efforts to see if this place was legit I ordered the \"Shepherd's Pie.\" The place operates an \"open-kitchen operation,\" which allows patrons to see the chef prepare, and cook the meals (+2 pts)\"Samoe\" was my bartender and I felt she was informative and provided others at the bar with quick and friendly service. (+2pts) Off back home to OC. Till next time Bay Area. Go Golden State Warriors!"

The staff was not very eager to help us and it took a few minutes to get a couple of beers and find a different person to take our food order. We ordered a couple of burgers and sat down to wait. We regretted placing that order less than a minute after sitting down. There was a young man on stage setting up to play. As soon as he began sound checking it was clear that this was his first live gig and the 10-12 people there to see him were obviously his family. When he actually began playing everything got much worse. The food seemed to take forever but that could have been because the torturous sound coming from the stage. Or food finally came and we ate the mediocre fare quickly so we could end our pain by leaving this establishment. Would not go back after this experience."

My girlfriend and I went there at about 6 pm not knowing it was slam night but we got there went in, grabbed a table and ordered food. Then when our food was served the door man came up to us and asked for 7 to 10 dollars for a cover charge. We politely told him we were just there for dinner. So he walked away. Then 5 minutes later he came up and asked us again for the 7 to 10 dollar overcharge and we politely told him that we were eating dinner then we were planning on leaving. Every 5 minutes after he would proceed to ask us for the cover charge. So we finished our food and left. When we got to the car I realized I had left my card on tab so I went back. The doorman was joking with his friend and noticed I was walking in when he asked me again for the cover charge. I just politely told him I was there to close my tab and be on my way. So I did and started walking back to my car. Then I noticed the guy that was hanging out with the doorman was following behind me. I got to my car and quickly turned around and went down the street but not before I saw the door mans friend reaching for something in his belt. I assume he was trying to intimidate me but 2 days later I was charged 22$ to my card from The Starry Plough. I called and the manager argued with me, yelled at me and refused to refund my money and to boot told me to f**k off. This place is shady. DO NOT GO HERE."

After most every band we would talk to the band members. We will tell them we came to hear them play but could not hear a note. They were sadden too that they were voiced over by all of the rude people. Like many other places in the Bay Area it get taken over by Hipsters and Techies.

I took it to go and it was a lot of food, especially since I had it with a big piece of toast and a whole avocado. I could have saved half of it for another meal but I pigged out. So, if you're on the fence, jump off and get yourself some of their veggie food!"

    "review": "I'm leaving a review for the sole reason (as usual) that multiple people have give a terrific place poor reviews.  First off, the food is amazing.  It's not necessarily healthy, or incredibly varied (and there pizza can be hit or miss), but the many burgers and fries are truly exceptional and a massive improvement on the previous options (5+ yrs ago).  The people who work here are not surly or mean and the bartender and head cook are both incredibly nice guys (the bar tender must have been having a bad day or something when those below came to visit).  The music and Irish-themed dancing and jam nights are one-of-a-kind in the east bay and deserve praise by themselves, but on top of that they give bands that are just getting into the bay area music scene a place to showcase their talents and provide a venue for poetry (really, you didn't like the poets, so you bashed the bar!).  Open mic usually draws a large and young crowd, so avoid Tuesday nights if you're into a more intimate setting and thur-sat band nights often has a cover.I will agree with a couple reviewers that its difficult to get a table on a busy night, but I recommend playing some darts (rarely being used) until one opens up.  The decor is awesome (if you're into Ireland) and the prices are very reasonable.  The only other thing I will concede is that a whiskeyless Irish bar is a bit laughable, but this is one of my favorite bars in berkeley and not to be missed."

As we entered the establishment we were greeted by a very kind drunk gentleman. When we mentiomed to him we were there to eat and listen to the musicians, we realized that all the seating was taken by people not eating or drinking.There were empty tables with no chairs. Too bad, you lost 8 customers who are supporters of local businesses."

Stories of revolutionary roots and clandestine trips to Nicaragua in the 80's. Great place to watch a big sporting event, and some of the live acts are amazing, although it can be hit-or-miss depending on the night. Food is decent for bar food, but don't expect gourmet quality.

What did I get instead? Beer, burgers, and new local spot. Burger is delicious. Homemade pickles, pickled for only 24 hrs, the sesame seed bun adds a great flavor and grease to the bun. Fries are good, I am guesisng also house-made.  Also they have root beer on tap. Where did my burger go? Oh. My stomach! Service is great. Kitchen closes at around 10:30."

The performers are all regular peeps who come to share their voices/words with others. It's great, I love it. There are sometimes live bands/djs too. Pretty great place to enjoy live entertainment.Not to mention the food here is pretty darn good. Everything is prepared fresh daily, or from what I observed they seem to be. The fries were cut on the spot. You know this isn't your typical kind of bar food cause they actually take time preparing the food. The burgers here are fat and filling. I was very pleased. Their cheesy pulled pork fries were pretty tasty too! Oh, and the bar is pretty awesome too. The beers are about $5 a pop. Pretty decently priced for a bar.If you're ever in this area, and love poetry etc etc check Starry Plough out!"

    "review": "The best thing about the Starry Plough is that it's constantly booked with eccentric performers. In turn, it draws very eclectic audiences. Open mics, 80s cover bands, celtic music, americana singer/songwriters, poetry slams, funk, local band album release parties. Chances are, if you wander in here, you'll end up being entertained by something. It's walking distance from Ashby BART, but also pretty easy to find street parking out front. The venue is relatively dive-y, the walls are covered with posters, both musical and political, and they typically charge a cash only cover on a sliding scale. The stage takes up a nice portion of the room, but there aren't an abundance of seats facing it  since a lot of space is claimed by tables. If you're not in it for the long haul, there's plenty of standing room and stools along the bar. Sound is usually decent. I wouldn't say that cleanliness is their strong suit, but they undoubtedly have a vibe. In the way of alcohol, your main options consist of draft beer, more draft beer, and some bottled beer - everything from Guinness to PBR. If you were wondering, they've got deals on pitchers and pints during happy hour/until 7 pm. If you don't like beer, you're left to choose from their house wines. Weirdest part? It's an Irish pub that doesn't serve whiskey. Yes, you read that correctly.I've never eaten any of the pub fare, but I've seen them serve up huge cheeseburgers and fries, piles of saucy wings, giant sandwiches, fish and chips, even calamari. The last time I was here, one of my buddies ordered some burger monstrosity with jalape\u00f1os and blue cheese. I think it's safe to say that if you're looking for greasy eats to accompany your brew, you won't have to look far. I'd come back to see a friend play a gig here, but otherwise, I'll leave the whiskey free zone to the troubadours and world music buffs."

    "review": "The Starry Plough is truly a great venue for intimate live music events with a wide variety of talent, room to dance without being judged, and great acoustics.  This past Sunday, I caught two musicians that will keep me coming back to Starry Plough again and again:Into the Pacific: http://tinyurl.com/intothepacific (My favorites are \"Hold Fast,\" \"From the Start\" and \"Sunrise, Sunset.\"  Esteban's voice is amazing and he plays the bass and foot drum while singing the songs he wrote.)andI.R.: https://www.youtube.com/user/IRfiq1 (My favorites are \"Driftin\" http://tinyurl.com/l2vjvzq and this other song I sadly can't identify but really enjoyed.)I've been to Starry Plough a few times before this and have always enjoyed the vibe, but I was always a little unhappy with how long it took to get the food.  Now I just try to plan better and order food way before I even think I am hungry.  Another minor complaint is that the Starry Plough only offers beer and wine, but that is really just a minor complaint because the beer selection is solid.To summarize, if you catch a great live music act, you will absolutely have a 5-star experience at the Starry Plough. Otherwise, it might be more of a 3-star experience, which is A-OK to me."

Dear god, yes! I had the mushroom-Swiss burger, my boyfriend had the bleu-jalape\u00f1o burger. He tasted both (I don't like jalape\u00f1o) and said mine was better. I know that mine was STELLAR. We also made a special request (which I didn't realize was special at the time, because I read a bunch of menus earlier that night) for chili cheese fries. The fries were AWESOME!!

For whatever reason I have found the best concert venues often have substandard food. So after grabbing drinks and wanting to fill my stomach I cautiously ordered a Big Kahuna Burger (bonus points on the name!) and some Calamari for my wife. We got given a number and only a few minutes later our food arrived! Impressive considering the huge crowds of people there for the show that night.Oh my gosh was that Big Kahuna Burger ever AMAZING! It was juicy, perfectly cooked (not too dry) and bursting with flavor. My wife had a similar reaction with the Calamari; it was crispy batter and juicy on the inside. I think she said it was the best she has had in months. The atmosphere is hip; posters on the walls from past and present, and just a cool place to hang out. There were lots of beers on tap and the prices were more than reasonable. Also the people there had personality! For instance when the runner dropped off our food he said we were number 3, and now he was making us number 2, and should we get lucky we might even get to be #1. It was quirky and fun. I love it!Will be back!Oh also worth noting:- Lots of free street parking nearby- Kitchen closes at 10pm most nights (so come earlier for food)- Cover is cash only- Arrive early to get seats; this place gets busy!"

    "review": "The response from Starry Plough is hilarious. The guy writing this seem to be the cook who jumped out of the kitchen and called the woman a 'Bitch' in ear of all surrounding tables including ours.  He cooked our food too and was wearing a white apron. When told to go away after pouncing in and swearing and yelling at the lady, he puffed up his chest and practically stomped his foot saying 'I'm the OWNER! I'm the OWNER!' He wasn't there, didn't know anything that was going on first hand yet was frothing at the mouth to support the weenie in the Jeff Campbell band's version of things and to play at power tripping. Any woman is entitled to push someone away who is inappropriately getting in her space as that asshole from the Jeff Campbell band was. She was sitting in HER seat minding her business when he harassed her while she was trying to listen to the guy on stage. He didn't like her asking him to shut up and she wasn't even the first one that had that night. The Jeff Campbell jerk had a totally different lady ask him to shut up earlier as he talked through the entirety of  Freedy's set and all the Jeff Campbell guy did is get up from his table and go chat more at the bar where the other lady eventually asked him to be quiet. The Jeff Campbell musician was an asshole to another musician as well as the people trying to listen and 100% provoked the situation with the second lady by hassling her at her table, and then was a big drama baby about it. Nobody was hurt and the jerk deserved to be pushed.  I gotta think he's embarrassed how this went down as both he and the bar look really bad. I gather even the cops laughed about being called. When I and other customers suggested this was not a big deal to this cook guy when he was threatening the lady sitting in her chair with cops he would not listen to us or any other patrons. The offended little Napoleon cook 'owner' was hell bent at that point on pulling his power trip to evict her. Many customers were appalled and one even got up and gave a speech to the crowd about how wrong it was before HE was threatened with being thrown out.  None of these people knew each other before but I've got to say, I feel like I made some friends. Its the old adage when good people stand up to a wrong and all that.  A long time customer of the bar  who was a local neighbor was also trying to intervene,  and told us that the real owner, this dude's father, was home in Walnut Creek that night and if he'd been at his bar none of this would have happened as the real owner was in the habit of habitually yelling out  'Quiet at the Bar' when necessary.  The local guy also mentioned that there had been some 'trouble' with the son being too big for his britches before. This bar is a nightmare of cacophony and only very loud bands should ever consider gigging there.  All these people were trying to help solve the problem that was becoming more and more apparent to everyone was the bad call of the bar in supporting the bad behavior of the Jeff Campbell guy. In any case, lets hope there is someone in charge over there soon who knows how to run a bar as this cook not only doesn't even know how to cook well but along with the guy from the Jeff Campbell band was the only one that night who was vulgar, rude and disrespectful and certainly didn't know how to defuse a ridiculous situation in an appropriate and professional manner - his ego appears to have  seriously gotten in the way. Maybe he has a future in Daddy promoting him to door man where he can have folks thrown out to his hearts content. There is a blow by blow account of this silly melee  being circulated to music fans by the guy who made the impromptu speech to the crowd that is the funniest thing I've read in awhile - neither The Starry Plough or the Jeff Campbell Band come off well and neither are making friends or fans from this night. Yelp could have been an opportunity for the Bar to save some face and apologize but instead they've stupidly doubled down."

If I have to pay to get in, in order to eat wings, I probably wouldn't go back.BEER & WINE (limited) ONLY Bands were entertaining.  Sound setup was good.  As a band, it's a cool place to play."

It's a herbaceous, meaty, slab of greed and food beckoned sluttyness. The 1st bite delivers you and the last sends you plummeting into the realization that the experience is over. This burger begets fatness. If all burgers tasted like this burger we would all look like the people in Wall-E and make little burger shrines that worship the mighty Angus and Kobe. The economy would fall into despair and cow meat would become a tool for barter.  Why does this burger taste so fucking good?!!!?I am 79% - 95% certain that this burger is a secret mechanism for world domination. Beware of the sweet, savory rivulets of grease that sumptuously slide down your cheek like dirty tears of joy as you obliviously nosh your way to oblivion. The impending calamity of  fatty grief and food snob ruin will be your only fate."

B. got fried calamari $6 - he ate a bunch & gives it 2 stars, it was crispy, but didn't taste like calamari, I didn't try it.  He also got 2 glasses of red wine - he seemed to like it.Band - was forgettable.  Bring earplugs!! otherwise you'll go Deaf!!  They charge you to hear the band - Not free.  Sliding scale, I think she said $6-12 when we went.After that band we left, but there was suppose to be a bunch more until Midnight!If I lived closer maybe I'd go back, not in any hurry."

This place serves up ONLY the finest BEER and WINE - ONLY. None of that get rich quick liquor.  The real estate (seating) was all booked up, so myself, my husband and his similarly named coworker all stood about trying to finish our beers ASAP to get further into the 'starry' bit of it.Done, done and done. Never returning. Unless... nope never returning. Well, unless - I'm driving down Shattuck and accidentally run over one of their patrons or something and need someone to call 911, because they seemingly alway cross the crosswalk at night in the dark out front of this place without looking for cars.Also, question of the century, why would the sliding scale have a limit of how much you can donate? This is not a scalable solution for the bands playing at this venue.I'll see myself out."

For starters, the Guinness was poured well, which should really be the lowest standard for a bar, but apparently that's assuming too much for a lot of other places. The pub had quite a few folks for a Monday afternoon, mostly local, and as evening approached, the weekly Irish dance lessons got underway, which was fun to watch.The best part was the food -- perhaps because it was so unexpected. I had the chicken burger, which was a grilled chicken breast on a soft and crispy bun, with fresh lettuce, pickles, and tomatoes. I mean, who'd expect a chicken sandwich at a bar to be very good? But it was delicious. The chicken was seasoned and cooked well, bigger than the bun, and covered with Swiss cheese. (FYI, cheese is extra.) To top it off, I got a side of garlic fries, which rounded out what may have been the best dive bar food I've ever had."

I had so much fun dancing by myself (with a crowd of others) that I completely lost track of time and missed the last bus home. Luckily, I was able to find someone kind enough to give me a ride. I highly recommend this show, different bands perform each month and so far, all that I have seen have been great.They had a sliding scale $6-$10 cover, which was great for me as I am currently unemployed and cash flow is a major issue. For this same reason I didn't order any drinks, but from what I saw, they do have an excellent selection of beer on tap, domestic, microbrew and imported in the $3-4 a pint price range-- when I have some extra cash I will certainly grab a beer. They did have a pitcher of water out for anyone to hydrate, which was great as you dont have to stand there and try to get the bartender's attention just for a glass of water like most places. Inside, there is the stage and dancing area on one side, and the tables and bar on the other. It was very crowded, but a warm atmosphere, I can safely say that most if not all of the people there seemed to be having a really good time as well. The location is very convenient to get to by public transportation, right off the 18 bus line, and not far from the Ashby bart and next to another venue I have yet to check out La Pena Cultural Center.On the walls are protest posters and Irish pride splashes here and there, and with the high ceilings, I didn't get the stereotypical  dark cave-like Irish Pub feel, which wasnt a bad thing, it simply had a feeling all of its own.I will for sure come back here to check out their Irish Music, Open Mic, Poetry Slam, Art Bazzar and other such repeating (every # day of the week) shows."

But don't let that scare you away! The anti-government/ Irish pride paraphernalia gives it a charm all it's own. I feel pretty darn lucky to have this happenin' little hideaway within stumbling distance from home. They've got an interesting line-up of live music virtually every day of the week. I haven't been to their infamous Open Mic night yet, but the Friday night shows have been fun, drawing a lively all-walks-of-life crowd.  You'll see old folks dancing tenderly, tripped out hippies with their eyes closed and their arms flailing, and tame observers tapping their toes. At least, this was the case for \"Petty Theft\", a seriously spot-on Tom Petty cover band.Speaking of covers, the bigger shows are usually $10 so you'd better plan to stay awhile, call some friends, and make a night of it. It's a down-home kinda place where just about any fun-loving boozer will feel welcomed."

Let's talk about an open mic host who goes the distance of not only providing bean bag chairs for the audience, but also giving complimentary back-alley massages.  Humor aside, the Tuesday Night Open Mic is a total hit in my book.  They take a while to sort out the lineups for the evening with bands and their groupies crowding the venue by 8pm.  The little'ns have to be out the door by 9, so all the under 21s perform first.I'm not sure what else to say besides there being stellar service, from the bar and beyond, cheap drinks, and cool live music."

(Sorry, still slightly under the effect of all the beer, all my GRE words are coming out!)  But then... the music started playing.  The people started dancing.  The old Irish man told us how the bartender was his daughter so he could get us our drink quicker.This place is magic, and I couldn't imagine a better place to celebrate St. Patrick's Day.Some observations: You'll notice that this place is just *so* Berkeley.  Adorning the walls are a fleece blanket with multiple portraits and profiles of Obama, vintage posters in both Spanish and English protesting neo-colonialism and supporting socialist uprisings in Nicaragua, Zimbabwe, and Chile, quotations from famous Irishmen, and the Starry Plough itself.I came to the pub in about as low of spirits and energy as one could be, and I left raving about how much fun it was to hear the Irish folk music, the grandma who hopped up on stage to sing an old tune, and the dance instructor who taught everyone to dance.  (By the way, at least now they've got dancing at 7:15 on Monday evenings.  I'll be checking it out soon!)A++.  Thank you Starry Plough for the most Irish, fun, neighborhood St Patrick's Day experience ever."

Not to mention the Guinness which  is the best in the area as it is poured from their taps quite frequently and not left to stagnate in the pipes like in other wannabe drinking establishments. Dont' come here if you are looking for fancy pants drinks. Irish pubs generally do not serve dirty martinis or daquiris or any of that nonsense. Man up and have a Guinness....it's good for you and full of Iron!  FACT!

The talent is actually fairly decent with folksy stuff prevailing, and there is no cover like there is for the Poetry Slam on Wednesdays. The bar is a bit small, so do be aware that it can get pretty crowded on Tues and Wed. The crowd is varied, the people I go with are all early to late 20's, but there are also quite a few older regulars as well. It can be a bit crunchy, but not in a bad way and the bar just smells slightly musty not hippie stinky. The main bartender (Shaheen?) is a riot, he always has fun stories to tell and is fun to talk and laugh with once things wind down after midnight. The drinks are good and average priced, and he knows how to pour -best tasting Guinness in Berkeley is here! The rest of the staff is great too, and everyone is super friendly. I always end up chatting to random people and having a great time. Also, the food is cheap but good! One warning though is that this is a beer and wine only place. Even though it is called an Irish Pub, there is no whiskey or irish cream here."

They were charging $10 at the door which is pretty steep, but I wasn't about to leave because the trek involved two wrong buses and way too much walking.  The venue was practically empty, but it was still rather early (around 10pm).  After the opening band was finished, they left and so did their parents, leaving about 5 people to watch the headliner.  That's cool; I came to dance, so I still boogied down and had a great time, but I noticed large groups of people turned away at the door because they didn't want to pay $10 for a band they've never heard of.  Reduce your cover charge Starry Plough! Don't you want people to drink your beer??..at least there's no line at the bar or the bathroom, I guess.My second visit was quite disappointing.  Came here straight from work one day to meet up with some friends, ordered a pizza and waited about an hour for it to come!  I understand that it's made fresh and takes time to cook, but after I ordered I watched the cook chat with one of his friends for 20 minutes before getting started on my order.  The price is reasonable, but the pizza is forgettable, and the service was just painful.Apparently they were hosting a poetry slam that night.  We weren't planning on staying much later, but certainly would've had another pint if not for the rude lady collecting money for the slam.  She came around several times to take our money, even after we told her that we were just finishing up dinner and would be leaving shortly.  She made us feel very uncomfortable, so we just left.3 well-deserved stars for good beer selection, and great service at the bar."

The bar itself is great, with friendly bartenders and a great selection.  However, during their shows, the place is open for all ages, and you know what that means - teenagers.  Imagine yourself, a fine adult enjoying a Smithwicks, and these kids going through puberty are gathered together drinking their Diet Cokes.  It's odd to say the least...But as a venue, this place is top-notch.  Those unfamiliar with poetry slams are in for a real treat every Wednesday night, as both amateur and professional poets take the stage to express themselves.  In some cases, I would go so far as to say it was more of a comedy show!Thankfully, the youngins usually leave around 10ish, so knock this review up a star when that happens."

I guess that just comes with the territory though.I was happy that the Starry Plough had my favorite beer on tap, Smithwicks, because not too many places I've been in this area have Smithwicks. Because it was poetry night there was an emcee but it was impossible to hear her over the music in the background and the talking of the other patrons.

I actually really like the fact that you can only get beer and wine here. I'm sick of going to bars and dealing with classless people who can't hold their liquor and try to ruin everyone else's good time over it. Especially when I'm just there to dance and have a good time without some sloppy-ass drunk spilling their drink all over me while they stumble stupidly all over the dance floor. Decent food, good grubbage for a night of drinking. Their fish and chips are pretty damn good and their burgers hearty. Yum. I have so many great memories from this place. I've met boyfriends here, made friends here, discovered amazing bands here, watched my son win a Mingo 2000 dance contest here during a day time all ages show, etc. etc. I love the Starry Plough! They're my neighborhood night spot and and I'm so glad they're here. One thing I'm unhappy about? When they remodeled their bathrooms, they painted over over twenty yeas worth of latrinalia (bathroom graffiti) and my favorite bathroom graffiti EVER is now gone. I have saved it to memory, though. Someone wrote: Some jaded miscreant sat here and thought about life for awhile... And directly under it someone responded: Thanks for hogging up the bathroom! Haha! Fer reals!

I've been here a few times to hear friends' bands play, and this is the only reason i'll come here.Although they have a large selection of draft beer, it's a beer/wine only bar. The food selection is limited as well -- burgers, fries, sandwiches, and pizza. I like their fries -- it tastes homemade. The kitchen closes at 10pm. Other nights may be different, but every time I'm here I notice more than 50% of the crowd drinking juice, Snapple Iced Tea or water, which is not a bad thing. You wouldn't want belligerent drunk during a show. It's also nice to be at a bar where you can feel comfortable ordering a cup of tea, which I did last night.Beer sells for $4.75 - $5, and the quality can be inconsistent. I had a very pleasant glass of Liberty Ale -- good pour and chilled glass. Yum. And then I had yucky Murphy's Stout -- taste was off, a little bit watered down, and too much foam.The sound guy should be fired!!! This guy never showed up last night. No phone call. Nothing! The whole show was delayed by over an hour. My friends called around friends and friends of friends and got a guy to come out and rescue three bands that were lined up to play. The crowd is very diverse -- young East Bay/SF hipsters, baby boomer hippies, arm-pit haired and no arm-pit haired ladies. Some people def have BOs."

I guess I have some deep, deep Irish roots or something, but this music just lifts me.  Or maybe because I play the violin (badly), but wish I could fiddle like some of these guys.  I dunno.  I think the only thing I'd like more is if they allowed smoking inside...this place seems to call out for it!If you're starving, the food isn't bad.  Definitely what is called Pub Grub, and as such, well prepared, especially the fries.  (Guinness and Fries for dinner.  Sign me up!)  My recommendation if you are going to hear a band you like is to get there really early, like at 7 or so, and grab a table in the main room.  Otherwise you're going to be perching and hating those bastards who are sitting where you wish you were sitting!  If you drive, please don't block the neighbors' driveways.  This is a neighborhood with real people.  Try taking BART. The Ashby station is just a few blocks away."

    "review": "The low score is because for me, food is the most important thing when you go to a restaurant, not dancing, so it's a personal preference.  But I appreciate the fun atmosphere that they have.  The food is mediocre, but maybe its because Irish food on the whole is bland, so I won't fault them for their food being boring. The parking is just impossible whenever I come out.  Then when I go in, it's a little dingy and depressing, so maybe it's authentic Irish that way.  They do have dancing classes on certain nights so you can learn how to do the riverdance, then its followed up by live music so you can practice your newly learned moves. The kind of people who come here are regulars who just love to dance, so at least they are having fun and I'll admit that it's infectious."

Huge banners of Che, other leftist propaganda, a stage for slam poetry and local music meets an Irish pub serving Guinness, Smithwicks, Harp, and fried food. Really hard to imagine until you walk in. Then it all makes sense. This place should get 3 stars for being what you think it is. But the constant local music, the community presence and neighborhood feel and the fact they have Sierra Nevada Porter on tap bumps it a up a notch for me. A place definitely worth checking out at least once."

I like how I feel when I get here. Every show I've been to here, people talked to each other, and who needs whiskey with all the great beer flowing for a steal. And its pub food, and the best of pub in my opinion.I sometimes like to go to Edinburgh Castle in San Francisco, and they serve Fish and Chips that feel like they've been in a warmer  for awhile. And NO one is saying its bad. Matter of fact I love having it because it is what it is.I love the cabaret/bizzare/jazz fused, rock fused music in the local scene. Always fun and the music is never boring. I wish I didn't have to cross a bridge to come hang out and have fun at the poetry slam. Sounds like the people who run the place know makes for bringing people together to interact and enjoy themselves.And.. the people who work here and the customers are relaxed with a cozy feeling.

It is like a teen rec center for misfits and hipsters. Yea there are a lot of hipsters which can be a little eh. But I love it. The poetry slam was better than expected. I also like the location. Sketch enough where a pot partaker could partake but not so scummy I was constantly worried my bike or parts of my bike would be stolen for crack. A wide variety of client\u00e8le and no cross cultural hating going on like you can find elsewhere in Berkeley/Oakland. Oh yea I had a cider for you yelpers to survey price and for $5 I thought that was fair and $2 for my temple. I think $7 for my steak/potatoes veggie dinner. Fair price even for a cheapskaker."

People chat, play darts (only one board), and even dance. There is dancing on Monday nights (lessons starting at 7pm for only $5). All in all -- I love it.But as is the way with love: some things have to be forgiven.1st: No rum...or whiskey...or gin -- or anything else outside of wine, beer, and cider.2nd: Sunday there is no regular menu and while the owner cooks a little something -- I would recommend eating somewhere else, or bringing something in (Francis says its OK!)"

The music is often decent, but the wait staff doesn't work the floor, which means you can get trapped away from the bar at a table and unable to get a drink, especially when it's crowded.  They could significantly increase revenue if they had cocktail waitresses to bring you drinks, instead they compensate by sticking you with a COVER CHARGE OF UP TO FIFTEEN (15) DOLLARS.  I don't pay that much on my let's-go-all-out-in-sf nights, let alone for some back roads Berkeley \"pub.\"  The bouncers can be pretty snooty about the cover charge -- don't think that by arriving early for dinner you're escaped, instead once the band arrives they'll go around and take a collection.  Pay up or get out!While the kitchen can be good (and I'm generally a huge fan of alcohol establishments that cater to the late night munchies), the quality varies widely.  One time I was informed that they were only servering the daily special, which was lasagna.  That certainly sounded good enough to me, until I saw the woman go to the back, scoop lasagna out out of a Costco foil tray, and then stick it in the microwave.They also boast to be a \"former home of the Berkeley IRA.\"  Here's a question:  if you're a member of the IRA, and your organization's purpose is to fight for the independence of Ireland, should you be in Ireland fighting for independence?"

When I have stopped in on my own for a beer while heading from here to there I have had some really amazing conversations with some kind people hanging out. And who can complain about the Imperial Pint? And frankly I love their cheeseburger and fries. These are frighteningly authentic fries here people. I am talking about a huge portion potato wedges bigger than your fingers brought to your table with all the condiments. For some reason I always slather mine in the malt vinegar that the fella from the kitchen brings to your table along with ketchup, mustard, and mayo. The burger may not be made from a politically correct grass fed cow who willingly gave its life for the good of humanity (not sure where they get their beef), but it is damn good. Thick. Juicy. And with a big old pile of crisp lettuce, a nice thick slice of tomato, onions, and pickles. And all of that is served on the plate next to your burger so you decide what to put on wnen they bring it to you. (I always eat the pickles on their own first). As far as being a music venue is concerned it can get absolutely packed but even when it does the people all seem very cool. Not pushing their way through the crowd. The one thing I wish they had was Sunday lunch hours. After writing my review I am now craving one of those burgers and I   they don't open till 4! Oh, did I mention the Imperial Pint?"

It could've been the gaggle of Bukowski's sitting around drinking, playing cards and going apeshit over the Sox game. They had fingers like Cheeto's and reeked of stale smoke when you walked by.

This being yet another \"passed it a million times for the last 10 years but never went in\" establishments, I am actually glad I never went or else I may not have kept my waifish figure for so long. *note said waifish figure no longer exists on me.*I wanted to be immersed in sweet music, rich heady beer, and savory brined meaty deliciousness (from the oven, you dirty birds). I was on the hunt for corned beef and cabbage. All hands pointed to here or Becketts. It was closer to home and not the insanity madhouse (well, almost, but not quite) of Becketts so two of my bestest friends fell prey to my promise of beer and briny meat to partake in St. Paddy's Day, Starry Plough style.The corned beef, cabbage and potatoes were great, as a return trip w/ JR reminded me. The Irish have a good thing going with all that salt and spices cooking up a pinky slab of beef. Being piggish as we always are, we tried to go for seconds but they ran out. Not surprising since it was around 9:30, so we tried their fish and chips. Too bad I don't remember how good it was, because my focus the entire day was seeking out the corned beef and cabbage so it looks like I'll have to go back and have a rematch. JR and I also had their chicken pot pie on another occasion, which was less desireable than the corned beef but on Sundays they apparently don't serve the full menu, they just make one veggie and one non-veggie dish. The crust was more biscuit-like than pie-crusty and most notably a good number of the potatoes in the pie weren't cooked throughly (there's a reason why chefs try to make everything uniform). We were starving however and ate around the uncooked potatoes, too busy listening to the reels, jigs and ceilis to care too much.  Many, many beers later, some spilt due to brimming pint glasses and inebriated jovial folks, an ear full of Irish tunes and two happily fed friends, we left the stuffy, humid building with good memories of good  food, good beer, good music and great friends. Thanks Starry Plough for the first but surely not the last St, Patrick's Day under your roof!"

    "review": "Well...there's the Starry Plough in Berkeley. There is the Plough and the Stars in Inner Richmond. One is an authentic Irish pub with music 5 nights per week, the other probably hosts music on a similar schedule but really shouldn't. I was slightly interested in going to Berkeley last night & seeing Wayward Sway perform at a bar similarly named to one of my favorite Clement St bars. They usually rock whatever venue they enter, but this was definitely an exception & not even their fault. From the start of their set, the sound was horrible. I'm not over exagerating, either. It sounded like the audio engineer was deaf--the instruments were about the same level as the vocals. A friend in the band mentioned that he didn't have stage monitor the entire time.For a \"live music\" venue & pub, this place horribly fails. Maybe it was a bad night for the audio guy, or maybe the apathetic & stuffy Berkeleytypes forced him into a downward spiral of not caring either.BEST PART:Thomas Kemper Root Beer on DraftIF YOU ARE ASKED OR HEAR THAT A FRIEND'S BAND IS PLAYING THIS VENUE, TRY TO TALK THEM OUT OF PLAYING HERE AT ALL COSTS!"

A folky, bluegrassy, hand-clappin', foot-stompin' crew. We were prepared for a good time; we'd heard good things about this place. That it was a great little pub-venue for local acts. We were expecting, well, um, FUN.But alas, this place was a real dud. First off, the kitchen was closed when we got there, at 10:00. Um... okay. What now? We'll get something to eat in the neighborhood! Only there's NOTHING in the neighborhood.But hey, it's not the Plough's fault the neighborhood is a snore. Also not their fault is the lame crowd that gathers there. The place was full. Full, alright. Of people drinking coffee and water (and one guy SLEEPING) and engrossed in conversations that I'm sure were way too sophisticated for us SF hoodlums to join in on. Because the joint had the most unfriendly vibe of any bar I've walked into in the Bay Area.They listened politely enough when the music started -- TOO politely. But they also never smiled. I kid you not. There was no smiling in this bar. I felt mildly retarded, grinning and swiveling to Martin's music.And they golf clapped. Once again, I kid you not. Golf clapping. To bluegrass.But again, that's a product of the people and not the bar. What IS the Plough's fault is that their sound guy SUCKS. Maybe it's because it was 4/20. Maybe he had a little too much wacky tobbacky, if you know what I mean... But he clearly was not hearing the same music we were hearing. Dude, vocals up. Stage monitors, perhaps? Seriously. It's not that hard. Four people shouldn't have to come up and tell you. Or maybe it's true: the Berkeley-ans are more intellectual than us San Franciscans. But our ears are definitely more refined."

    "review": "An authentically grungy Irish pub-cum-cultural center situated in south Berkeley (\"Broke-ley\") near Ashby BART, the Plough is a home away from home for grayhairs and willowy maidens alike. The food is greasy (but fairly decent) and dirt cheap ($2 burgers! Even dirt isn't this cheap!), the bar keeps BOTH Guinness AND Murphy's on tap, and is often tending by a charming 30-something dark-haired Irish lass who taught me a few words in Gaelic (ga ha mahagith to you too, darlin'). Their website calendar isn't updated frequently, but know this: weeknights you can expect a local cadre of regulars to bust out their fiddles, mandolins, and guitars to work up a feverish jig while patrons  nurse their stouts. Weekends usually feature a line-up of newly minted bands straight from their garages--not a good time for a quiet conversation. And here's the biggie--a dealbreaker for some--Wednesday nights are Slam Nights, when the Plough charges a cover to support bad poetry. The only time I was ever impressed by the quality was about five years ago when Mike Cirelli dominated the local poetry slam scene with his odes to waitresses and Point Reyes (dude even published a chapbook called \"My Tarnished Heart Still Blings\" before getting out of the inbred Slam scene for good).Still, for a local hangout with no pretense, no meat-market, and  good vibes (a good thing, in vibe-friendly Berkeley), the Plough is a Brokeley favorite."

I enjoyed myself, even though open mic can be brutal here (as I guess it can be most anywhere), because people are getting wasted and they want something entertaining for the most part.  They don't want you to express yourself artistically so much as make a fool of yourself, which is fine.  Definitely fine.\n Anyway, I like the Starry Plough.  I appreciate people getting up and doing whatever it is they do.\n I think the Poetry Slam Wednesdays is a lot bigger than open mic Tuesdays.\n Their beer selection is poor, but that's an Irish pub for you -- it's all about the Guinness."

Which means that you should probably check what event is going on there before you head out, because maybe you're not the kind of person who wants to spend their Tuesday night watching depressed Berkeley girls with shaved heads twang away on their acoustic guitars while singing about lust. I know I'm not. Thankfully, Starry Plough has a decent enough selection of beer so you can at least get nice and hammered during the Tuesday night open mic session. Bounus points for you if you pass out.This place, I think, has plenty of ambience. It just isn't the hip kind that you can get in San Francisco at nearly every bar you go to. The Starry Plough is laid back as hell, and it's more of a community atmosphere. Friday and Saturday nights are their live music nights. Once again, a very hit or miss thing. Awesomely awesome bands like Charming Hostess, Idiot Flesh (rip) and The Kehoe Nation have played here, but that don't mean crap. They're really lax with their booking policies so you could end up watching some group of 17-year-olds who have no practice outside of their mom's garage.Another heads up: a lot of the regulars at the plough are weird as hell. Middle-aged, former hippies who damaged so many brain cells while dropping acid that they now forget to wear deodorant. Personally, I find it endearing."

    "review": "The Starry Plough is unmistakably Berkeley.  If you yanked the place up by it's foundations and plopped it into any other city, it wouldn't work in it's current form.  It can only work in Berkeley...and it works well in Berkeley.\n The soothing sound of  Rhythm + Blues greeted my ears as I walked into the most well-preserved stronghold of old-guard Berkeley culture I've yet to encounter.  An aging bar with a  feel of history sits up against the South Wall, while a sizable stage sits off to the side of the entrance facing Shattuck Ave.  Adding to the Berkley theme, a sizable collection of aging political flyers announcing protests, rallies, and varying political statements graces the area around the door.  A fair amount of seating sits in front of the stage, gracefully blending into an eating area near the kitchen in the back.\n Several windows near the entrance enhance a pleasant daytime vibe. The incoming sunlight  creates a natural glow around the end of the bar, then slowly fades to an appropriate cafe-like subtleness in the dining area.  The Starry Plough's layout is truly interesting.  It incorporates the elements of a bar, a performance area, a kitchen, and a restaurant into one space...and does so without any one section stepping on the toes of another. It's very old-school....and very Berkeley.\n I sipped an ale and looked around the Starry Plough, glancing about at several young couples as I chatted politics with a collection of middle aged men.  At the same time, I could easily image being transported forty years prior to another time, where the events advertised by the antique posters on the wall were taking place.  I could envision the place filled with long hair, tie-die shirts, and peace-sign medallions.  It was easy to look up on the stage and envision idealistic voices from the last generation attempting to rile the masses to support the passion of their choosing.   In this day and age, countless memoirs of local culture have perished at the hands of the hip and trendy, and few remain.  Finding the Starry Plough was a refreshing experience.  While old-school Berkeley may not be a significant piece of history, it's history nonetheless.  And somehow, after quaffing a few pints at the Starry Plough, I feel just a bit more in touch with what it was..."

There's always a ton of energy during these slam contests, and even if you can't understand a word the poets are speaking, their theatrics are entertaining enough. However, I have never come here for the bar itself and decided one Sunday to check it out with a friend.\n Well apparently Sunday night is Celtic night, or otherwise known as \"church\" to those who scoff at it. I soon discovered why...people gather together to sing old Irish folk songs, play Celtic music, and dance folk dances. This was very interesting to watch, and enjoyable to listen to Irish music while drinking Guinness, that is until I wanted to hold a conversation with my friend and the director stopped the music and made examples of us. Evidently, talking during \"church\" is absolutely unacceptable. I would have completely understood had I been in a real church, but we were in a bar for crying out loud. \n I agree with others--The Starry Plough is old and tired.

The after work scene in there is mellow and relaxing, but at the same time they can really pick it up and pack in a crowd for any number of quality musical acts that they book. The sound in there is good, and the stage is only a couple feet off the floor, so its very intimate. On top of that, the bar has the best collection of protest propaganda from the past 30 years, yellowed from hanging on the wall in a formerly smoky bar. They really ought to restore those. And they DO need to clean out some of those lines AND get IPA back on tap for my uncle who spends too much of his time and money in there to be denied the beer he likes god damn it! Ok. I digress. The food here is great. Ricardo is an awesome chef and the bar is lucky to have him because if the food sucked on TOP of there being sour beer in some of those lines then the place would have shut its doors years ago. The best show I have seen there, and also the most crowded, was the Asylum Street Spankers from Austin, TX. Go check these guys out next time they come in to town, but dont forget to use your inside voices. If you do forget, the band will remind you. They frequently tell the crowd to shut up because they play acoustic intruments with minimal amplification. And they are great.There are two references to the Starry Plough on Yelp. I wonder if they'll figure out a way to merge all the repeat entries? But thats a question for the webmaster. This is where reviews go, right? Ok."

The night I went, Kid Beyond (the ultimate beatboxer) was a featured guest he was way cool (although some of his numbers were a bit on the long side).  The event is judged by the lottery picked members of the audience who hold up numeric scores after he poet goes, and the best part is that each of the 5 audience judges get a free beer for their services.  The host of the event was witty and entertaining, the talent on stage was impressive, and the crowd was down to earth and respectful of the poets.  The house jazz band, 3 Blind Mice, was surprisingly REALLY good and weaved in and out of the poets quite well. The show starts at 8:30pm, there's 2 rounds of poetry, and it goes till about 12:30pm.

This is a one of a kind, all ages, music venue with tons of geeky and amazing comic books for sale in the front of the house. An incredible combination, I know.

We showed up at to a concert at 8 (the time stated on the ticket), and went inside, only to learn that the performers wouldn t go on until at-least 10 (and that the openers wouldnt preform till at least 9?). Since we were not told this and we now had 2 hours to burn, we tried to leave and were told that of we did, we could not come back in. Since we didnt want to wait 2 hours in a hot cramped space (with no seats), we left and lost the money we paid for tickets. Very unhappy with the way the venue handled this whole situation, and how the venue communicates policies about their concerts. Would definitely not come again :("

The main area is open and can accommodate a small circle pit, and the sound system is good. I dig the framed concert posters that fill the walls of the back room; it gives you something to look at when lounging at one of the few tables. Theres also a  back patio that has some benches & chairs for fresh air/smoke breaks (kinda counterintuitive, I know). I should also note that theres plenty of free parking on the street, and the neighborhood is pretty clean; Ive never seen any dirts roaming around, but it is San Francisco,  sooooo... Ive only gone to punk shows at Bottom of the Hill, thus tickets have been relatively cheap ($20-$25, including the ~$5 fees), so no complaints there. I cant remember how much drinks cost or how good they were---which likely means they werent ridiculously over-priced and got the job done---but I typically drink gin & tonics, and you cant really go wrong with those."

The shape and sound of the room is great for those mid-size touring acts, but every time I have been, the place was packed, which always feels good to see the strong support for those lesser well known acts. Gotta give it up for this venue for giving those great bands a solid platform. Tickets are usually very reasonably priced. If anything, they seem unrealistic for San Francisco, but thats why I love this place. Holding it down, and maintaining an enclave for the arts and expression to thrive in the heart of a city sterilized by cost of living."

But thats not all! Making new friends is #classic when you find that one person in the crowd who just sets the #night on #fire So #cozy with black light posters that glow during the show (if you can pay attention... But if youre paying attention to a poster while someone is playing, #best be the #opener! ) and are #gorgeous In one word: #balls In two words: #bigballs In three words!: #bigbouncyballs In six words!?!: #bigbouncyballsoffthewalls I mean it! No lie... Watching @kflay for the 4th time (2nd time here! First time was a little over 5 years ago on my 5th year anniversary being married to the #absolute #love of my #life! #Ruby (Not her actual name, but thats a whole nother story all together! - for another time  ) yesterday on #taxday and I would say @kflay killed the show... But that would be a #lie! @kflay WAS THE #SHOW and oh boy could I tell you about it!! But there just isnt enough time, because this is all about @ thebottomofthehill While @kflay (whom btw I just #HAVE to mention, just to give you a taste of how bad I stink!   I literally brought my #bassguitar for @kflay to sign.  Why does that stink? #GOODQUESTION! The answer: I only told her #literally #hours before the show and I #actually thought I would have my #cookies because I prefer over cake - You are what you eat! and eat it too. Was soo heavy, and some might say for nothing! I say Only a small part to yet another #unbelievable story I have to tell!) did not sign my bass, I #did lock eyes with her as she exited the stage, but instead of what happened right when I got there! (which after years of experience in going the distance for a show, leaving #fashionably #late not only #avoids #traffic, but if timed properly... You make it right for the headliner! #fortherecord - I have showed up soo late to catch only #three songs, but I won the tickets soo... ) I went straight to the back to check out whatever inventory was left, and as I turned around to find my #muchbetterhalf @rubyubie she was no where to be found because from the #patio area #coincidentally located in the back, walks into the room non other than @kflay herself! And I was taken back... #Frozen like a #skunk in the headlights as she took less than ten steps #probably and #tookthestage Reminded me of the time one of my most #influential #idols came walking down the stairs right in front of my face! #Who? Im so glad you asked! #BlakeSchwartzenbach (Not his actual name... If you have #noclue who he is, I could probably say the same about me! Unlike me though, he is SO SMART! His first band I fell in love with is called @Jawbreaker and straight from the horses mouth - #24HourRevengeTherapy is #thealbum that was Their first complete story.  SO! A little more about Jawbreaker... They started out 100% punk, and wouldnt you know, back when they first blossomed, they would play #here! See how it all comes togerther? #butwaittheresmore! Soo.. #24 was their #breakthrough album where pretty much one line from one of their #famous songs you probably know, but you dont know you know, but you should know! (hehehe heads up! Hes so smart!!! You have to decifer what hes really saying in #alot of the lyrics ex. I blew twelve kisses and kissed your thirteenth finger. #thinkaboutit #Itjustmakessensewhenyoudontthinktoohard ) called #boxcar suming up what they #wanted to say!  First line Youre not #punk, and Im telling everyone! Save your breath!  I never was one... You dont know what Im all about. Like killing cops and reading #keroac  This was the #first #notable #breakthrough #album for me that is so #personal I am pretty much explained through #every #song The other album half, in the exact same #wantingtoshowwhattheyweremadeof @TheOffspring s #IxnayontheHombre (Which I literally bought the vinyl just a day before the show! Bought the cd back in 97) Both reminded me of @kflay !!! P.s. - @kflay #MUSTHAVES!"

The place is mostly a dive bar, with little tables / seats and a stage, from what I know, since they mostly focus on shows. the acoustics are alright, definitely fine for seeing someone you enjoy. I read previous reviews stating parking may result in break-ins, but parking about a block away had no issue, it didnt even feel sketchy, though I would still hide or take valuables. It mostly is an industrial from what I can tell (live in the East bay), with little people roaming around at night outside of people in the neighborhood or people working."

Cool area in the back of the club for bands to set up merch tables to sell records and tshirts...etc.... Cover charge is decent for a medium capacity venue. Bartenders are usually prompt...I feel the prices for drinks are on the higher side. The vibe can be a little cold as far as friendliness is concerned. All staff seem a bit standoffish, but it is not a big concern to me in the grand scheme of things,as no one is militant or helecoptering over me. I can relax here and it feels adaquately spacious inside and out. Parking is okay...I usually find a space. The location is good, not too far from the Bay bridge."

You can typically buy tickets in advance or at the door, at least, I had those options. The sound as good but the lighting is pretty dark, even for a club. I would recommend bringing ear plugs, especially if youre up close. There are mens and womens bathrooms but theyre not clearly labeled to the right of the stage. Theres a picture of a little girl on the ladies door, which has 2 stalls and 1 sink. The bathroom was small but clean. Parking in the area is a bit of an issue, so Id recommend arriving early and parking on the street. Just pay really close attention to street signs and parking restrictions because some areas require permits so be prepared. I usually like parking in pay lots because of safety but the neighborhood seemed ok. It is in San Francisco, so if you dont like parking on hills (which I dont), just try to be there early to look for your ideal parking. Enjoy your shows!"

The food is good and not what you would expect at a bar. The quesadilla was delicious. Not really my scene, but its got plenty of good qualities. The patio/smoking area is pretty nice and has an entire wall of plants abd succulents."

    "review": "I had not been to Bottom of the Hill in years until last night 2/1/18. The Lillingtons were in town and I did not want to miss out on this! Doors at 8:30, show at 9. I arrived at 9:10 and the place was already packed. Friendly staff checking IDs and tickets. I did not order food or beverage while there, but saw others enjoying spirits and eats. It gets pretty warm inside, but theres a back patio you can escape to. Clean, stocked restroom. Attended another (sold out) show on 2/17/18, my car was broken into. While they do post notices on their door and windows stating to leave nothing in your vehicle, my car and several others were hit sometime between 9pm -1 am. This venue does not allow in and out privileges for patrons.  With that being said, perhaps they will consider posting security OUTSIDE the venue to deter things like this from happening.  People will be less excited about coming to a venue when their vehicle is likely to get vandalized or worse.  Luckily, there was nothing in my car to steal, however the damage they did to the vehicle itself is costly. If you have a hatchback, I recommend removing your rear deck lid so thieves can see you have nothing back there.  Hopefully it saves you a broken window, or worse."

    "review": "First time visiting bottom at the hill. Was there to check out a band, Sick of Sarah, who were performing for the night. A small and cosy venue space ideal for smaller bands. The bar only accepts cash, likewise cash payment for the entry fee if any. They do have an ATM just next to the entrance if you didnt carry cash. Though the place appear kind of old and rundown, the sound system was good. The bar carries the typical alcoholic drink and a limited list of beers. Drinks are cheap, beers were at $6/bottle. Tried to request for Mojito but they do not have any mint. So ended up with two Strongbow cider which worked out well too. Two girls next to us ask for their special shots listed on the wall, the bartender whispered to them that he got no clue what it was. Thought it was pretty hilarious, apparently he was just stepping in before the real bartender comes in. The streets were pretty dark by the time we got there, it appears to be located in the midst of an industrial area. Ideal for a music venue so there wouldnt have much sound/music limit restrictions. There are plenty of parking along the streets so thats great for those who drive. Its also a short distant from the 22nd Caltrain."

If you get there too late and you end up in the back and youre short like me, you cant see much.  We were lucky to be about 6 deep from the stage.  Also this venue brings something out in the artist where theyre wanting to be part of the audience and theyre more than willing to come down and sing on the floor. The used the back room to sell merchandise the night we were here.  The wait is long since we had to make a line against the wall and wait for the meet and greet and then by merch all in the small back room.  But it was cool because everyone hung out and chatted with fans.  The guy that worked there was very good about keeping things organized, keeping people from cutting the line and really just a cool dude. The down side of this venue, waiting outside can get cold, the area is really dirty with trash and the risk of having your car broken into."

There was a minor water leak in the ceiling in the dance floor area that occasionally dripped with noticeable water on the floor.

Later in the night people started to get on stage again and so I went up to her and asked and she said oh yeah they are letting them do that now. Ridiculous and rude. Literally go to any other club."

    "review": "Rickshaw Stop has an awesome lineup of bands--both well-known and lesser-known--which is awesome! It has a fun, small-venue feel. Because it is relatively long and narrow, though, the stage can be difficult to see. Also, Im not sure if its a general rule or just the concert I saw (Im leaning towards the latter), but the crowd seemed more rude than average. There were chains of people pushing their way through the crowd mid-concert into pockets that didnt exist. I wasnt even halfway to the stage, either! Anyway, good music but not great building layout."

I managed a mere 3 blocks away further down Fell St where I found a nice Thai place to eat dinner before the show"

The Acoustics were wonderful and everybody could see well especially from the floor. It took a while for the bar to open but that probably was because we did the early bird tour which cost a little bit extra but we got to meet the musicians in person and got a signed poster. There was beer on tap that was passable and mixed drinks which we theres also self-serve water which was excellent and I think every venue should have. I couldnt believe how inexpensive the tickets would have been otherwise. The main difficulty for me was finding parking but I wouldnt expect otherwise in a big city. So Id say find a show you like and go!"

We dubbed that the  Moms club  as there were about 8 moms sitting waiting for their teens. We took BART in to SF and walked to The Rickshaw Stop.

There doesnt seem to be any reason not to have a few more to prevent forcing people to sit on the floor. Otherwise a great venue. Looking forward to checking out music shows as well."

Its got a backyard patio feel to it with the lights hung on the ceiling and an upstairs balcony with adequate seating if you dont want to deal with the mosh pit that downstairs will eventually become. My only gripe about it was that it got very stuffy and hazey.  But I guess thats to be expected when everyones jumping up and down, dancing.  Overall, a good time!"

I was able to find a dry cider--yum! What a celebration this 2023 Saint Paytrick Day was!!! It was standing room only. They had Irish bands, Irish dancers, and it was an open mike for singing Irish songs. They offer foods like Corned Beef and Cabbage, Fish and Chips, and Bacon Cheseburger, but we had dinner before going there. They looked good, though. The Starry Plough is a hangout for Irish and Irish wanna bes. They have live music, Irish music, and even Irish dancing."

    "review": "I hate to have to leave this safe space a terrible review, especially if it s the only one star review. Not saying that the behavior of an employee defines the business, but my experience there was terrible when I went there with my older sister and some friends back in June 2015. I have been having trouble finding the bar, but I remember how it looks like and I just found it, so here it goes: I am a vegan, and employees in this restaurant won t give a single hoot accidentally fooling a vegan. Hecks, they didn t even apologize! I asked for a vegan burger, and then I either asked if the cheese or if everything is vegan, and the lady said yes. Then I noticed mayonnaise. I asked the male employee if the mayonnaise in the vegan burger is vegan and if the cheese and bun is vegan, he said no. Then they were taking a while to remake it, and then the guy just jumped to saying that they don t swap it for another order and that they give no refund, and that they re not like McDonald s giving the refund and it seems like they reserve the right to refuse checking for the ingredient. Safe space? When they fool someone with food allergens, they will be shown to not be that much of a food allergen friendly area on the news. Maybe they already did, which is maybe the reason why they are temporarily closed! Vegans, do yourself a favor and do not come to this restaurant when they reopen. They will most likely not give a single hoot about your diet and will fool/fraud you. Just because this place is a safe space for LGBTQ, it doesn t give them any more right than others (not the special exemption) to fool vegans. Just a note, veganism is not the same exact same thing as vegetarianism, and chances are if someone is trying to order something vegan, they are vegan, so don t play any bets with feeding them non-vegan stuff. Is Berkeley not supposed to be a progressive city? This business has shown that it doesn t belong in Berkeley, nor in California, nor in the United States, nor in any republic or democratic nation."

There was only one time when the corned beef sandwich had enough vinegar and it was bliss. All the other times it was a bit off.

The menu is a tasty Irish blend of satisfying pub food from cheesy pulled pork fries all the way to Shepards pie! The weekly events are a must see as well! There is always something every day, but the one that keeps me coming back is the Berkely Poetry Slam on Wednesday nights!  Stumbling into the Starry Plough was one the homiest places Ive walked into since I moved here 7 years ago."

Live, traditional music, open mics, poetry slams, touring guests, and their house sound engineers know their craft! Ive never been blasted out of the room there, or had to reach for my earplugs   regardless of the performers  which is the hallmark of a great live performance venue, but still seems to be a very rare treat to find. They also have a limited but excellent kitchen. The Shepherds Pie is worth a Sunday or Monday visit. (But bring your own HP sauce!? ;)) Beer, wine, cider and hot and cold non-alcoholic beverages are available and the staff always makes you feel welcome. I love this place. Its easy to feel enough at peace here, to let your heart sing and your spirit dance for a few hours. If traditional Gaelic and Celtic music is in your blood (or youre just curious enough to seek out a local, live performance) theres few places in all of California, that are better than The Starry Plough."

I was told - repeatedly - by other patrons that all the food was amazing, but I can only speak to the great cheeseburger (perfectly cooked, slightly pink in the middle) and fries I ate. About 20 taps or so, 8 on rotation including a cider in each. Definitely a spot for locals, show up early for a good seat at the bar on Mondays - the free Irish dancing is led by a 6 piece flute, string and percussion band with rotating members. Plenty of friendly women and men who enjoy showing new dancers the ropes."

I go there Tuesday nights when audience members who want to get used to being performers, can.  But, many others are already on tour as was Laryssa Birdseye and her drummer who I happen to plop down next to.  And everyone else in between is enabled to do what they do in an accepting atmosphere (usually).  IFK you want to eat, the food is delicious, although I cant see how any one can eat a half-foot-high hamburger with dignity.  I live for the bread pudding topped with ice cream thats drizzled with a design of heavenly chocolate sauce.  My mouth is watering for it now. Even their 5-scoop bowl of ice cream, sauce and nuts is worth waiting for while enduring a dirty comedy routine."

I was there on a Tuesday evening - open mic night was coming up and the regulars who invited me cautioned me it could get loud and conversation less easy after about 7:30 (live music is also featured). They have a kitchen and I hear the food is good but I notice most of the patrons seem to be putting their coin into drink, just the kind of balance one might expect in a good pub. I liked being in the midst of a widely mixed group of folks, very Berkeley; old school a bit in the vibe as the roots go back to at least the 60s."

Irish music sessions on Sundays do provide Irish music, but the band is a crowd of 20 or so amateur musicians, and it only takes one or two of them to be out of tune or off rhythm to make it baaaddd Irish music.  Walls are festooned with sayings and pictures of heroes of the Irish resistance like...Che Guevara?!?  On the plus side, the burgers are very good and and there are vegetarian options.  The sad thing is this could be a 5-star Irish pub if they just put more Irish beers and food on the menu, took down the Che poster, and insisted on the band auditioning its members."

    "review": "Came here to see my coworkers country band and was really impressed with everything.  Has a really local mcdocal feel to it and everyone there seems to know each other.  The bands that played were really good and some people even got up to dance.  They also served food and I wished I had come earlier because by the time I got there the kitchen was closed.  My friend had fries with pulled pork and they looked amazing.  Would def come back to see more live music but will make sure I leave enough time to order some food."
