655bec6496d2ab904d8001e3,3,Unapologetically Unforgiving - What is this thing?,"So let me start with this, I wanted to be fair but also express why I'll probably never use the company again. Please note I've ran 6 campaigns with Playlist  Push over 2 years and there is good and bad to Playlist Push. Here is what I've learned.....1- It's definitely a legit platform that allows artists to present their music to... lets call them music Connoisseurs. But be warned the platform has no problem letting you pitch a song to a bunch of playlists it had zero chance of making to begin with. Either because of overly broad Genres or Billboard quality expectations.  1-2. It is REAL- so there is no armature option and the platform provides no bell curve, so curators will judge your music on an almost Billboard Chart scale. So if you are not objective about your music and ready for professional level feedback that's critical of your work, don't use it. But if you're looking for honest feedback from people who mostly know what their talking about, it delivers that in flying colors. 2- What they don't do a good job of is making sure your pitching it to the right people. For instance when you start a campaign they allow you to pick 6 Genres, DO NOT, I repeat do not select a basic Genre like Hip-Hop or Rock. If you use basic genres the Platform will show zero discretion and pitch a Rob Zombie style song to a Lynyrd Skynrd inspired playlist, or a deep J Cole type of song to a Pop Rap Hits playlist. I've had this problem in everyone of my campaigns, so just know if you're not super deliberate with your classifying of the song. You can have good music that will be well received by curators, yet still not get a placement. This is because there's no safeguard to prevent your song from being pitched to a playlist it had zero chance of making to begin with. So if you are gonna run a campaign with them, make sure to have one of their people help pick the Genres for you. It cost me a $1,000 to learn that lesson, your welcome.3- Listings DONT mean PLAYS, like half of, if not more than half of the playlist will get you basically no plays. BUTTT some will get you TONS of Plays and help grown your fan base. Again a testament to the platform being real, but more of a review platform.The problem with Playlist Push is they present themselves like a Good Caterer. But they operate like a Grocery Store, I'll be it a nice grocery store like a Harris Teeter, but a grocery store none the less. They are selling Access not a Service, they are a middle man, not advocate. And it leaves you feeling a lot like you're dealing with a record label, but just the mid parts, you never got your chain and your paying them.

Please note I've ran 6 campaigns with Playlist  Push over 2 years and there is good and bad to Playlist Push. Here is what I've learned.....1- It's definitely a legit platform that allows artists to present their music to... lets call them music Connoisseurs. But be warned the platform has no problem letting you pitch a song to a bunch of playlists it had zero chance of making to begin with. Either because of overly broad Genres or Billboard quality expectations.  1-2. It is REAL- so there is no armature option and the platform provides no bell curve, so curators will judge your music on an almost Billboard Chart scale. So if you are not objective about your music and ready for professional level feedback that's critical of your work, don't use it. But if you're looking for honest feedback from people who mostly know what their talking about, it delivers that in flying colors. 2- What they don't do a good job of is making sure your pitching it to the right people. For instance when you start a campaign they allow you to pick 6 Genres, DO NOT, I repeat do not select a basic Genre like Hip-Hop or Rock. If you use basic genres the Platform will show zero discretion and pitch a Rob Zombie style song to a Lynyrd Skynrd inspired playlist, or a deep J Cole type of song to a Pop Rap Hits playlist.

For a budget of about $520 Playlist Push ESTIMATES that they will push your record to about 85 playlists with about 50 curators. I got 40 responses from curators with 8 adds to the playlists, roughly 20%.  Some of the curators control several playlists with only slight variations between the list that they curate.  The record was hip-hop/pop but the AI pushed to primarily EDM playlists. The position on the 8 lists was not particularly good, but it was apparent that some of the playlists are curated by other artists and guess whose music occupied the number 1 position, the artist. Playlist push claims that the average number of followers for the combined 8 playlists is 156,416 but the lists are excessively long, no one is listening to a playlist with that many songs (hours to hours of songs). Also, some of the curators commented in other languages but my language is English and that wasn't the language preference for the record.  The comments to you are as if you selected their list. Feedback about a finished record is not immensely helpful at all. Also note that as the list adds more records, your position could change from one day to the next. The invoice does not mention anything about the estimate they present to you when budgeting.  Again, it is not worth the money.

My issue is that they straight up lied. At the end of my campaign I only was submitted to 30, many of wich were inconsistent with my chosen genre. Let me say that again. I got submitted to LESS THEN HALF of what I payed for. They are thieves. They don’t care about the curators or clients. I reached out via messenger and told them I was dissatisfied with the number of submissions, as I bought the campaign under false pretenses. They “did me a favor” and extended the campaign by 5 days to the generous tune of ZERO responses.I want to clarify this has nothing to do with being accepted by playlist curators or my rate of yes/no’s. They did not fulfill their promised allotment of submissions. I got 30 out of 75-77. Let that sink in..I asked for a refund of $260, half my campaign, as I was only submitted to half Playlists I was told I would be when purchasing. Sounds fair right? No refunds no matter what. How unethical is that? How does that equate to anything but thievery?Never using the service again. I am only writing here because I’m so enraged by their thievery that the only way I can feel slightly better is to ward off any other independent artists trying to invest in their music careers. Save the money for Insta ads, Facebook ads, merch, literally anything else. I repeat, they are thieves. Good luckEDIT: For sake of transparency, after some back and forth I was able to get $130 refunded back to my card. First they wanted to give me $100 off in future campaigns. Seeing that I was no longer Interested in using their site again I said that wasn’t a solution. Finally I received 1/4 of my original payment refunded,  though it was like pulling teeth and I believe they would have gladly kept the money had I not “put up a fight.” All things considered, I wouldn’t recommend this service.

63513888276a7fd30bd58d8d,1,"Stay away, not worth it anymore.","I cannot be happy with my latest PlaylistPush campaign (157933). I manage some EDM artists (our main artist has around 300K monthly listeners on Spotify), and we already did some - moderately successful - campaigns in the past. The last one was disastrous though. Although the track was specifically targeted, the 322 USD campaign only resulted in... 117 random streams in total. This makes no sense at all. Many of the curators responded with 'style does not match', although the targeting was done correctly, and we are still happy with that. One curator put the track at the number one spot of his list (so that the system would say #1 spot), but then immediately dropped it to a much lower spot, where it barely generated any streams. Another playlist resulted in precisely 0 streams. This is just a rip off. We tried to communicate this to customer service, but felt we were not heard. A 15% refund is all we were offered. We would really appreciate to have another look at our campaign, or do a redo with another track. If this is too much to ask as a valued and returning customer, I'm afraid this was our last campaign. As such, we would advise to stay away, unless you want to throw money in an empty pit.Update:I was asked to take down the above review while they would do a rerun. In our communication, one of their team members remarked that the selected track was not ideal for a campaign (without any further explanation) and that he ‘would not have suggested running this campaign’. When I then proposed to do the rerun with a different track and prepared everything for this, he suddenly changed to ‘The team thinks this track will do well on a rerun’. Go figure.

62e74a554c35e69ec51f7c13,2,A legitimate service that may not provide the value you expect.,"I'm an experienced recording artist with an average of 15,000 Spotify listeners per month. I've used several other legitimate playlist services with good results, so I decided to give Playlist Push a shot at one of my tracks. I spent $335 to have my track sent to 30 playlist curators. This was the most I had ever spent on a single campaign. The results were 28 rejections and one acceptance from a playlist with 9,000 followers. In terms of the cost of customer acquisition, this was the worst result of any of the legitimate services I’ve ever used. I’ve literally gotten three times the results for far less money from other services. Playlist Push advertises the fact that the curators must provide a short written review as an added value. The problem is that the curators are basically just fans. They do not have any special knowledge or insight into popular music. Their reviews are often incomprehensible nonsense. They babble on about mixes and timing and production and other things that are just not accurate. And they are wildly inconsistent; one said my vocal was too experimental and another said it was too traditional. Go figure!In addition, their knowledge of music is limited. The track I submitted was an updated cover version of a classic blues song to curators who were tagged as liking blues and blues rock. Yet not a single one of them recognized the song. They all thought it was an original composition.Aside from musical ignorance, it’s hard to fault the reviewers for being lousy writers. It’s extremely difficult for anyone to articulate, in writing, why they don’t like a particular song that is supposedly in their preferred genre. These people may be avid listeners, but none of them are writers. The bottom line is that I paid $335 for inarticulate reviews that I don’t need. I would rather they just say, “No, sorry, I don’t like it,” than try to give an explanation. While I think Playlist Push is a legitimate service, as a business model it’s weak.

If you’re thinking about paying top dollar for this service, think hard about what you want in return.","i'm an experienced recording artist with an average of 15,000 spotify listeners per month. i've used several other legitimate playlist services with good results, so i decided to give playlist push a shot at one of my tracks. i spent $335 to have my track sent to 30 playlist curators. this was the most i had ever spent on a single campaign. the results were 28 rejections and one acceptance from a playlist with 9,000 followers. in terms of the cost of customer acquisition, this was the worst result of any of the legitimate services i’ve ever used. i’ve literally gotten three times the results for far less money from other services. playlist push advertises the fact that the curators must provide a short written review as an added value. the problem is that the curators are basically just fans. they do not have any special knowledge or insight into popular music. their reviews are often incomprehensible nonsense. they babble on about mixes and timing and production and other things that are just not accurate. and they are wildly inconsistent; one said my vocal was too experimental and another said it was too traditional. go figure!in addition, their knowledge of music is limited. the track i submitted was an updated cover version of a classic blues song to curators who were tagged as liking blues and blues rock. yet not a single one of them recognized the song. they all thought it was an original composition.aside from musical ignorance, it’s hard to fault the reviewers for being lousy writers. it’s extremely difficult for anyone to articulate, in writing, why they don’t like a particular song that is supposedly in their preferred genre. these people may be avid listeners, but none of them are writers. the bottom line is that i paid $335 for inarticulate reviews that i don’t need. i would rather they just say, “no, sorry, i don’t like it,” than try to give an explanation. while i think playlist push is a legitimate service, as a business model it’s weak. if you’re thinking about paying top dollar for this service, think hard about what you want in return."

I can just as well write to a colleague who has such a playlist or use Submithub & Ko-Fi, in which I pay a fraction of Playlistpush and would have more of it.But when I once wanted to register at Playlistpush with my playlist, which had several thousand followers + good streams, I was rejectedI also find it a pity that a playlist with 500k followers (from College Music) left my track in the playlist for only 4 or 5 days.For the price I pay, I expect that my tracks could stay in there longer.Especially when it says: we strictly select our curators so that the streams are correct in comparison to the followers.But this playlist has generated me every day about 150 streams although it has 560'000 followers + the track was placed in the top half.Of course there were also very positive things that I was added to 1-2 playlists at the end, they gave good streams and mine is still partially in there. (Playlist by Steezyasfuck)This one has 130'000 followers and generates about 800 streams every day.So in conclusion: The concept of Playlistpush is really cool, could make good experiences.It also excites me a lot to start new campaigns in the future, but because a campaign can not be created under 250 dollars approx, I have to think twice for the beginning.But I think I will come back for sure to get new experience.All the bestLipoov",2022-01-19T19:28:51.000Z,"January 11, 2022",Lipoov,1,CH,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/61dd63ffe1196e51d7601513,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/61dd6373b54e860012307ea9,First of all I was very disappointed in…,first of all i was very disappointed in…,"First of all I was very disappointed in the first week.Playlistpush (and other youtube channels) advertises and says they are very selective in choosing playlist curators and see that the streams are in the good range with the number of followers and they only accept curators who have larger playlists.

619e719cbd63dda48263c47e,4,Feedback from my first 2 campaigns (updated),"UPDATE TO INITIAL REVIEW AFTER FEW MONTHS:I came back to increase my initial score a bit as my last campaign has consistently delivered increased streams and followers since I wrote my initial review (not massive numbers but consistent, which is important). So while my initial points still hold, I do appreciate Playlist Push responding to my review with helpful guidance, and the fact that the campaign is indeed proving itself over time. Will use again in future for the right release. INITIAL REVIEWI ran my first two campaigns recently. It was quite an investment for me and I picked two songs that I felt were really strong contenders that would appeal to a large group of curators. The results were a bit disheartening. The first campaign was ok with 5 small- medium size playlist adds, but the second one only got 2 relatively small playlists.The majority of feedback from curators was overall positive but for some reason most of them chose not to add it to their playlists. Genre mismatch was mentioned a few times even though I tried my best to select the right genres. I understand the model of paying for pitching to curators rather than paying for guaranteed streams (which makes this legit vs all the other dodgy pay for play services) but I also didn’t really want to pay quite a lot of money to just get positive feedback from unknown paid curators without any help to reach more listeners, which is what I was investing in.The sign up process was easy but felt a bit automated with no visible effort on playlist push' side to sense check if they genre selection are the best for the song. I would expect their team to know their curators best (As I have now visibility when submitting) and some help to try maximise my campaigns' chances for success would have been great given the money spent. Some genres are quite broad and most songs overlaps some genres, so it's hard to know what are the right ones to select (one, two, many?) to find the best fit to your specific curators. So to then get a message that says amazing song but not a fit is quite disheartening...(eg one song was a depressing ambient folk ballad but was submitted to a wedding playlist for some reason)Over six weeks my listeners have increase by almost a 1000, which is really cool and helpful, but only a few more followers were added and just about a 2,000 streams so far over two campaigns, although this is still ticking up (but quickly losing steam). Again this is cool but for almost $600 I expected help to reach more new real ears. I understand some parts are outside Playlist Push’ control given their current model, but some ideas to improve would be:a) some help to make the submission process a bit less like a black hole eg genre checkb) some way to get e.g. a playlist credit back if it was rejected for the wrong genre or something arbitrarily that would be cool (would force curators to stay true to their feedback) c) Would also be really helpful to get an idea of the size of playlists that a song is being pitched for and their average streams per month/ some kind of ROI projection. There is a big difference between a playlist with 100k vs 1k followers and one with loads of followers that don't listen to the actual playlist (ie bands following playlists but not engaging with it)I also gave access to my Spotify artist account as instructed but it was never added on my account, which made me think that no-one is home that side and everything is just automated...I run a label with lots of new releases and would really love to use this service again, but with no money being made from streams our pr budget is super stretched so spending $300 on a campaign needs to yield some solid results ito streams and new followers to justify the spend vs other channels.

615c2b58d12ab8ef515ddfd5,1,False Hope! Rip Off!,"The playlists spots are not guaranteed. The promoter is to send your music out to various playlist curators for a period of time based on your budget. The idea is to expose your music to as many curators as you paid for and hope these curators add your music to their playlist. But I’ll mention my experience. The 1st red flag is when they act like you have a budget option but when you go to set your budget it can’t be anything less than $300. 2nd red flag was when I filled out their initial form and didn’t upload any music, but they kept emailing me telling me how good my music was and that it was accepted. So I did 2 things. I put about $330 on one campaign with no music and I put $330 on another campaign with music. For the campaign with no music submission, I picked various hiphop sub genres. For the campaign with a song I picked precise sub genres. In less than 24 hours I received messages from playlists curators who were expressing why they will not add my music to their playlist. The campaign with no music had the similar feedback as the campaign with music. Not precisely, with different verbiage.  “I really like this song, but...” What amused me the most was when some so-called curators said “This song is too upbeat and my audience need a more angry sound”. Could this be? Yes. However, for hundreds of dollars the playlist promoter should send my song to the right curator. Also, we cannot respond to the curators. If we were able to through playlist push it can really help our marketing strategy. To make a long story short, I asked for a refund and some unprofessional looking guy named TJ sent me a message about not giving refunds. I had my bank contact them and that unprofessional guy named TJ sent me the most professional email stating he would give me a refund because I was unsatisfied.

Rip Off!,false hope! rip off!,"The playlists spots are not guaranteed. The promoter is to send your music out to various playlist curators for a period of time based on your budget. The idea is to expose your music to as many curators as you paid for and hope these curators add your music to their playlist. But I’ll mention my experience. The 1st red flag is when they act like you have a budget option but when you go to set your budget it can’t be anything less than $300. 2nd red flag was when I filled out their initial form and didn’t upload any music, but they kept emailing me telling me how good my music was and that it was accepted. So I did 2 things. I put about $330 on one campaign with no music and I put $330 on another campaign with music. For the campaign with no music submission, I picked various hiphop sub genres. For the campaign with a song I picked precise sub genres. In less than 24 hours I received messages from playlists curators who were expressing why they will not add my music to their playlist. The campaign with no music had the similar feedback as the campaign with music. Not precisely, with different verbiage.  “I really like this song, but...” What amused me the most was when some so-called curators said “This song is too upbeat and my audience need a more angry sound”. Could this be? Yes. However, for hundreds of dollars the playlist promoter should send my song to the right curator. Also, we cannot respond to the curators. If we were able to through playlist push it can really help our marketing strategy. To make a long story short, I asked for a refund and some unprofessional looking guy named TJ sent me a message about not giving refunds. I had my bank contact them and that unprofessional guy named TJ sent me the most professional email stating he would give me a refund because I was unsatisfied.

When their website said they listen to every track they ""approved"" my track in less time than it would have taken to listen to the track. When I emailed them about this they assured me this was an error and that they do listen to every track, but then when pushed on it their founder admitted that they did not listen to the tracks but instead just insured recording quality quickly and moved on. So I unfortunately decided to test out a track with them. After submitting my track and spending $300+ to be pitched to up to 30 playlists, numerous playlists sent back that they didn't add songs of my genre. I was told by the founder that they ensured that my money wasn't wasted by making sure that songs were submitted only to relevant playlists.The playlists I did happen to make it onto are not even active playlists, most of them gaining me less than 10 streams in the last 2 weeks. Playlist push is a waste of money and they try to make you think that they understand your music and pitch you to curator's that add those kinds of songs but they don't.

Sometimes my 2020-2021 songs are added to playlists with 2010-2019 in the title, which doesn't make sense.","for starters, i'm glad that this service exists. very helpful service for artists who have a catalog of songs that they want to get heard by a larger audience.to artists that are considering using this service, you should understand that you're paying for curators to listen to your song. from there, curators have the option of adding your song to their playlist(s). often, they will choose not to add your song to their playlist(s), or they will add it for 1-2 days before removing it. it can be brutal at times.some of my songs have really benefited from this service, while other songs have been denied by all curators. i'm not complaining, just want other artists to understand what they're paying for. this is not a quick trip to success, it's a tool that you should utilize after you've created a song that you think kicks ass.overall, i'm satisfied with the results that i'm seeing, and i'll use this service again.the reason i give 4 stars instead of 5 is because this service can be improved. two improvements that come to mind are...1) require curators to keep an approved song in their playlist for a period of 30 days.2) ban playlists with prior years in the title, such as ""2010-2015 pop hits"". sometimes my 2020-2021 songs are added to playlists with 2010-2019 in the title, which doesn't make sense."

60511a8cf85d75064c439069,5,One of the few legit Spotify Promo tools.,"Playlist Push is - as far as I can tell - one of the only legitimate ways to promote to Spotify. I’ve always had a good experiences and will continue to use it. Just a couple cautions / things I think could be improved: 1.) The system works great when your track is fairly easily recognizable as a certain genre, but not as good for things that don’t really fit into specific categories. So for instance I’ve had pop singles get added to over 50 playlists, whereas one song I wasn’t sure how to categorize got almost no adds - the first time that had ever happened. So I would advise giving considering to your genres before investing in this. 2.) It would be nice to have a tiny bit more transparency into the genre interests of various playlists (similar to how SubmitHub does it - even though I generally hate that site) because sometimes you and the playlister have different definitions of what a genre is. One time I tried to promote an ambient record and got a lot of comments back that said “I only play relaxing piano music” which, to me, is not ambient music. Similarly there is no way to identify things like playlists that only play instrumentals - something I’ve been burned on.Overall, it’s absolutely worth the investment as part of a larger promotion strategy - and I hope the system will continue to evolve and be a bit more targeted and efficient. You will get results, but you should also prepare to get a lot of “this is good but not right for my playlist” type feedback.",2021-03-16T20:52:28.000Z,"March 16, 2021",Christian Erickson,1,US,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/60511a8cf85d75064c439069,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/60511968c06806001b65cd93,One of the few legit Spotify Promo tools.,one of the few legit spotify promo tools.,"Playlist Push is - as far as I can tell - one of the only legitimate ways to promote to Spotify.

So that’s a thumbs up for customer service. I will update again after the re-run. The positives:Relatively easy to setup the campaign and the interface to view and reply to responses is user friendly and easy to manage. It did provide streams and some playlists adds.The negatives:My track received 98% positive feed back. Only one person didnt feel the song and the other liked it but didnt love it enough to add. The other 98% of the curators loved the track. Out of 22 responses, I got added to 7 playlists. The ones that did not add it said it didnt fit the genre of the playlist. Seems the matching method needs to be improved here as that seems to be the common thread. The things that concern me are that most of the streams were over seas in Indonesia and other countries as such. Once the campaign ended so did the streams. I find it ironic that the curators coincidently removed the song the day the full campaign ended. Also, out of 40 saves, I only gained 2 follows which the saves could be from my own listeners from my social media. I also gained around 1500 streams and around 1000 listeners from Playlist Push alone. I’m uncertain of the legitimacy of the playlists/streams.

6006bc12755dc108b41a66be,3,Evan Spee There Be Some Trouble Here Release,"Hey guys n gals.  This campaign was overall a good experience.  Music is subjective and I was glad to have been able to pay your company to get a song in front of curators.  I’m giving a 3 of 5 for a couple reasons however.  One is the upfront cost for a single track is high.  This as stated in your website is to give curators incentive and grow Playlist push as a company.  I get that.  It’s still too high a cost and discourages another campaign.  The other reason for the lower score is I believe (for this price) there should be more chance of adjusting your genres once the campaign starts.  It seems the system is built very heavily on selecting your genres upfront with no room for adjusting.  I had curators tell me I like the song but it’s not my genre too many times.  Example (not folk enough too Blues, then another says not blues enough too folk) or (not quite my exact niche).  That’s hard to work with and quite nit picky if I can’t adjust genres to get a song in front of different curators.  Also most of the curators I received reviews from had only been working for less than 6 months.  So it’s hard to take that seriously.

5fde65f1755dc10b48289dc4,4,Highly Satisfied!,"I've always been confident that my music would be successful if only more people could hear it and give it a chance.  Playlist Push has made it possible for me to get my music heard by a significant number of new listeners all around the world!  Overall, using the service has been a pleasant experience.  My one small suggestion would be to provide a complete listing of ALL available genres with descriptions & examples, to make it a little easier to choose ...and maybe offering an additional field (or fields) to describe your song's mood/vibe beyond just the genre; to identify it as happy, sad, fast, slow, etc., and direct it to curators with playlists that match.  For example, I have a number of slow songs that would probably be suited for ""Quiet Storm"" sub-genre within the ""Urban""/""R&B"" genres, but some are love songs and some are sad songs.  I'm afraid I will get rejections because a song may fit the genre, but not the vibe/mood.  This has already been a recurring theme in the comments from curators who received my songs for consideration (based on the selected genres), and said they liked them, but that they didn't fit the mood for their playlist(s).

5fd55e34755dc107e0c133cb,2,"Real streams but too pricey, and curators are a mixed bag","Pros: This is obviously a real service and so far I haven't encountered any playlists that are full of bots. This is a big plus and sets Playlist Push apart from its competitors. Cons: Because you're dealing with real people, the curators themselves are a mixed bag. Some will give you helpful feedback; others will waffle on with an obviously flawed understanding of the production tropes of your specific genre, or production in general. For example, I pitched a psych rock song and had a few curators tell me the mix was fuzzy and ""not professionally recorded"". Obviously, psych rock relies on a lot of fuzz, and the track was in fact professionally recorded. A perfectly squeaky clean psych rock song is not something most people who listen to the genre want to hear. We had one curator tell us that the drums were lost in the mix behind the vocals, and another tell us that the vocals were lost behind the drums. On my listening, both cut through perfectly well, as they did to everyone I've asked IRL. All in all, you can tell which ones aren't actually producers themselves and just like to put others down. An option to reply directly so that they don't feel impervious might help this. Another quite big con is that most of the curators are sitting on followings of only a few thousand. This means that for the price you're paying, you're not going to get many streams, unless your song is the sort of middle-of-the-road type of thing that every curator will add. If you're playing something a little out of the box or have interesting or original production techniques, many of the curators will use this as an opportunity to tell you how bad you are, and this isn't the sort of atmosphere that facilitates originality and artists taking creative risks. I really think that Playlist Push is charging waaaay too much for this service and ultimately that's why I've had to give it only 2 stars.Edit: for clarity, my song was pitched to about 25 curators and was picked up by a little less than half of them.Second edit: Playlist Push have now attempted to have my review removed.

If you dont want bad reviews, fix your site and lower the price.","pros this is obviously a real service and so far i haven't encountered any playlists that are full of bots. this is a big plus and sets playlist push apart from its competitors. cons because you're dealing with real people, the curators themselves are a mixed bag. some will give you helpful feedback; others will waffle on with an obviously flawed understanding of the production tropes of your specific genre, or production in general. for example, i pitched a psych rock song and had a few curators tell me the mix was fuzzy and ""not professionally recorded"". obviously, psych rock relies on a lot of fuzz, and the track was in fact professionally recorded. a perfectly squeaky clean psych rock song is not something most people who listen to the genre want to hear. we had one curator tell us that the drums were lost in the mix behind the vocals, and another tell us that the vocals were lost behind the drums. on my listening, both cut through perfectly well, as they did to everyone i've asked irl. all in all, you can tell which ones aren't actually producers themselves and just like to put others down. an option to reply directly so that they don't feel impervious might help this. another quite big con is that most of the curators are sitting on followings of only a few thousand. this means that for the price you're paying, you're not going to get many streams, unless your song is the sort of middle-of-the-road type of thing that every curator will add. if you're playing something a little out of the box or have interesting or original production techniques, many of the curators will use this as an opportunity to tell you how bad you are, and this isn't the sort of atmosphere that facilitates originality and artists taking creative risks. i really think that playlist push is charging waaaay too much for this service and ultimately that's why i've had to give it only 2 stars.edit for clarity, my song was pitched to about 25 curators and was picked up by a little less than half of them.second edit playlist push have now attempted to have my review removed. good thing i have the receipts. if you dont want bad reviews, fix your site and lower the price."

5fb3200b5e693f0a84291118,1,Worst service ever,"This is possibly the worst service i have ever encountered. I have been using their website as a curator and out of nowhere, they excluded me from the network without any reason and removed every single track from my playlist (prior to that, someone from an unknown location logged in with my account, i asked them what is up with that since i kept getting spam messages on my phone from the 2 step verification option and it is suppose to be impossible for someone to log in without it but somehow they did.).I immediately went to their live chat support to address the issue and their reply was that 'yeah it looks like your account does not qualify for playlist push' although i was reviewing songs all that time and i had passed their verification process already. Maybe the fact that i was about to review tracks and get paid 600+ dollars made them ban me without any reason.The worst part was that i asked for an explanation about the whole situation and also asked them why was someone trying to log into my account out of nowhere and was successful, even though there is a 2 step verification process that is suppose to be making everything safer. Their response: they checked the message, i could see that they've seen the message from the notification at the end of the message and 2 minutes later, they switched it to 'not seen' and completely ignored me.This is extremely unprofessional and i suggest you avoid their services in general. Even when they send a track over for review, most of the times it doesn't even fit the actual playlist genre of the playlists that a curator has and the curator has to add it to the closest thing possible or not add it at all.Edit 1: After checking the locations from the IP's that logged with my account, i can see that every IP is from Los Angeles and i am not even close to the USA. But when i came here to leave a review, i noticed that the owner of Playlist Push is from there so it looks to me that they actually logged into my account and removed all the tracks without any warning and excluded me from their network. They even removed random tracks from artists that had nothing to do with their platform and i had just added them because i liked their music, hoping that they would be heard from whoever listens to my lists. Now, i have to explain to all the artists what happened. I think this kind of behavior is just unacceptable from a service that claims to be professional above everything else.Edit 2: So you basically lie to people and didn't even bother checking my actual profile even though i was apparently checked, not once, but 3 times from an admin on your website (because, according to your website, in order to do a payout, the account has to be checked by an admin and i did 3-4 payouts before i was blocked and the message that was popping up saying that my account needs to be checked, disappeared after the third payout.)1: The lists are not at the same follower count and you actually excluded me the very first time that i applied on your platform saying that i had 'low follower count' although i met your minimum requirements in terms of followers and then you accepted my application 2-3 days later. If you had an issue with my follower count, why did you accept me in the first place? As for the number of the tracks that are in my lists, i never had exactly 32 songs. Right now, i have less than 40 only because you logged into my account,  removed almost all the songs that were in there (except the ones from big artists and you even removed tracks that are not from your platform) and that resulted in me being left with less than 40. Even after the removal, the numbers are not the same so i don't know how you coming up with such thing.2: I never EVER had any email on my bio. I don't even have a bio!! You just blatantly lied and made an excuse.3: My reviews were weak? I reviewed more than 200 songs through your platform, you have checked my account multiple times according to you, no one ever complained for the actual reviews (and you mention one example out of those 200). The artists even gave me points for giving helpful reviews! I write what i like and don't like (if there is anything that i don't like) and that is it. Is there a problem with writing just the important stuff, according to my point of view?4: Never added a pure piano track in hip hop. If a hip hop track has piano in it, it is still hip hop. Where am i suppose to add it to? Classical music?  I have stated an issue before the first edit. There are a lot of people here complaining about this sort of thing. Up to this date, you have done nothing for it.Final note for the artists: They mostly send your tracks to low lists so they don't have to pay them much.

5f4e7cbd02e85708c8dd9786,3,good service but pricey and has its flaws,"I've used this service twice for 2 different songs. I have gotten pretty good results stream-wise, but that did come at a fairly steep price of about $800 US per campaign. Even though I did my best to be very specific when selecting the genres for my songs, it was still being pitched to curators whose playlists didn't match the sound or vibe of my music. That led to me being rejected by playlists that I wouldn't have wanted to be pitched to in the first place. For example a fairly serious record with a chill vibe being pitched to ""happy"" playlists, ""workout"" playlists, ""bass heavy"" playlists, and even instrumental playlists.I emailed the guys at PP about this and they were helpful and understanding, and offered me a free extension on my campaign and let me know that I could block certain curators from being pitched to in the future, but that still leaves a good chance for the record to being pitched to new curators who's playlists don't match my sound. I think the service is great for getting your music heard, especially if you make me music that is structured like whats already out there and appeals to the masses. If your subject matter or sound is more out of the ""ordinary"", it may be difficult to get it pitched to your target audience. Overall I'm pretty satisfied with my experience with PP.

The parameters were very specific, and I was able to select the genres that were applicable to me, as well as similar artists.

This would enable the artist and curator to connect, share more detailed feedback, advice, etc. The price point seems a little high to me. I chose the minimum campaign that was still $260. Can't imagine paying almost $1000 just for play-listing opportunities. Maybe some sort of discount for repeat customers would be good!

5e9472a8086b6409bc835c93,3,Playlist push is an average service.,Playlist push is an average service to getting your music out there.  I will say there are some playlist accounts on this service that do wish to help you get your track(s) heard.  But there are also a lot of people who believe since they have a playlist they some how are now actual qualified music curators.  The name in itself is rather misleading as most of the responses you will spend money on will not result in a playlist push at all but rather someone just giving their very narrow opinion on your song.  Which would be fine but playlist push doesn't give you the credentials of the person reviewing your song.  So you don't even know what kind of music background the person has.  So you can be a musician who has spent decades studying the art of music and have some random person who just happens to have a playlist come try to give you advice that they may not be even qualified to give.  So I don't think their platform is there yet.  You also really have no control over which playlists hear your song.  You can pick genres but they still cross over.  For example I find when I submit a pop song I got EDM playlists that won't take my song.  Which I understand why but I don't understand why my song went to them in the first place. But the easiest answer is they don't have enough playlisters on their platform.  It really comes down to luck and which playlisters you land.  Some want to help get your song out and some just want to be a judge.  In the end I'm not sure it is worth the money they are asking yet.

5e865532086b6409542e5999,3,First two week campaign was great...second two week campaign was dissapointing!,"I did a four week campaign for my latest single. The first two weeks I was very satisfied with the playlists I was added to as well as the feedback those curators provided. Being very satisfied...I decided to continue the campaign and do an additional two weeks (which interestingly enough cost more than the first two weeks?) However the second two weeks was a bit of a wash and very disappointing - my song was only added to one playlist and the playlist curators responses were at best ""love your song but not my genre"" ""your song doesn't fit my style of music, etc"" ""not the type of music I playlist"" -it seems to me my song was pushed to curators in the wrong genre???

5e4e8f093c93ae0bc4065415,1,EDITED: I got added to a bot playlist,"I got added to a bot playlist, got replies like ""we only take piano neo classical"" even though I obviously didn't apply to playlists of that type, etc. I did get a lot of FAKE plays (which I don't want at all) so my experience has been pretty bad. The campaign is still running, but I already regret spending any money on this for fake plays messing up the algorithm and my believability as an artist.--Edit: I'm in contact with playlist push and they're investigating the issue. Support has been very fast and friendly so far. I will raise my rating for now and will reassess after issue has been resolved and situation clarified.EDIT 2: It seems things have stabilised and might have been a false alarm, though the behaviour was indeed very weird. I will update again as soon as I know more. For what it's worth, the support from PlaylistPush was truly excellent so I'm increasing to 4* for now.EDIT 3: will update again. playlist has been blocked from playlist push, plays have dwindled, i think it was a bot. will confirm with playlistpush for the reason they blocked the playlist and why i wasn't informed. seems something went awry. still, support has been fantastic, results very much less so.EDIT 4: the playlist was a bot, most other replies from playlists were just weird and generic. also, I never heard back from customer support again. Would not recommend this service, also from what I heard from my label's experience. Too much bot activity going on. Now with spotify cleaning up bot followers, my followers have dwindles by 100%, all due to this service.So again, I wish these guys all the best and hope they get this under control, as I don't believe the mean to do harm or cheat their artists or curators, but things aren't working out atm.EDIT 5:As a reply to playlistpush and their reply to my post: Wow, so it really takes a 1 star review to get an answer from you guys? Come on.And just to get set the record straight from my side, it went down from 445 to 217, not nearly zero. sure, I'm no Beyonce... But yes, you were not the only ones adding fake followers to my music, which pains me even more. My label used a service (you or submithub, I don't know) which added another song of mine to one of their playlists (new indie radar by sonority online) which now also seems to have been outed as a fake play/follower generator.Either way, I wouldn't recommend you guys or any of these services.But let me reiterate: I spent many good, well-meaning and informative emails writing back and forth with your founder George Goodrich who seems like a stand-up guy, to be honest.

5dd67388c84545093cf6d0fc,2,Interesting service with lots of room for improvement,"I ran two campaigns with Playlist Push and while the idea of the service is what the music industry needs, their system to help you has a lot of flaws. Here is my experience:In June I pushed a Dance Pop song. Check Juze - Night Shift if you need a reference.I used the smallest campaign for 380€ and a possible landing of 10 playlists. After two weeks (which is the normal push time for every campaign) I actually landed in 11 playlists. Here are the stats - first number is listeners, second is streams:Hidden Gems: 			49 	       /      186Marathon Playlist:			393	       /	499Pop Hits 2019:			226	       /	414Best 2019:				228	       /	367Chill House Hits:			1800	/	3200Electronica 2019:			40	       /	68Happy Summer Beats:		33	       /	39Farofa POP:				107	       /	153Top Hits (Clean):			2200	/	6100Charts August 2019:		2000	/	3200New EDM:				440	       /	554Total:					7516	/	14780As you can see. 8 out of 11 playlists were pretty much dead. 380€ are quite expensive for those kind of statistics.Nevertheless the service center of Playlist Push is pretty good as they offered me the same campaign for my next song for free to show their commitment.This time they pushed a very popish songs of mine. Second song for reference: Juze - You Don't Need MeThey matched the reach of the campaign I was not happy about, so again 10 playlist placements and they only got 2 this time. Those run right now for several weeks and are pretty much dead as well. Review time:First things first. I do like that PP is not offering a certain amount of streams for your money. That is never legit as no one can promise your song connects to the audience. You cannot measure your Return Of Investment of solemnly streams. There is way more if it comes to that. That's why I like the system of PP. They sent it to people who listens to your song and then decide if they want to place it or not. With that you are certain that if someone decides to place your song you hit the right audience which is key in building a solid fanbase.Nevertheless I ran into loads of comments/reviews that my music doesn't fit the style of the playlist ergo the tagging system of Playlist Push is weak. You pay a bunch of bucks (it's very expensive) to then been sent to the wrong people?! Their biggest flaw is that they tag your song per genre, but never per mood. My song was pushed to Chill Pop lists and they said that they loved it, but it's too energetic for their lists. And that's where your money goes down the drain.Playlist Push doesn't consider that small artist use their service. The big guys are backed by Spotify and their editorial lists. Just the small guys need a marketing that runs through private playlist placements and those small artist save up money for months to spend it then on one song. Seeing your carefully saved up money being flushed down the toilet hurts. So here is my advice: improve your tagging system strongly so that the submitted songs land on the tables of curators that have a value for the artist. Also: Small artist cannot afford your high prices that's why they chose small campaigns, nevertheless you should give them the same chance on being landed on your top playlists (big followership + ACTIVE listenership). It's not appealing to save up money for two months to get offered 10 playlist placements and 8 of those create 300 listeners in 1 1/2 month (review time of Playlist Push: 2 weeks push, 4 weeks of accumulating stats and let the song grow).I still want to thank Playlist Push for the great communication!",2019-11-21T11:22:48.000Z,"November 21, 2019",Julian Schulze,2,NL,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/5dd67388c84545093cf6d0fc,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5d1eff37c4b22d34fdeb913a,Interesting service with lots of room for improvement,interesting service with lots of room for improvement,"I ran two campaigns with Playlist Push and while the idea of the service is what the music industry needs, their system to help you has a lot of flaws.

Here are the stats - first number is listeners, second is streamsHidden Gems 			49 	       /      186Marathon Playlist			393	       /	499Pop Hits 2019			226	       /	414Best 2019				228	       /	367Chill House Hits			1800	/	3200Electronica 2019			40	       /	68Happy Summer Beats		33	       /	39Farofa POP				107	       /	153Top Hits (Clean)			2200	/	6100Charts August 2019		2000	/	3200New EDM				440	       /	554Total					7516	/	14780As you can see. 8 out of 11 playlists were pretty much dead. 380€ are quite expensive for those kind of statistics.Nevertheless the service center of Playlist Push is pretty good as they offered me the same campaign for my next song for free to show their commitment.This time they pushed a very popish songs of mine. Second song for reference Juze - You Don't Need MeThey matched the reach of the campaign I was not happy about, so again 10 playlist placements and they only got 2 this time. Those run right now for several weeks and are pretty much dead as well. Review timeFirst things first. I do like that PP is not offering a certain amount of streams for your money. That is never legit as no one can promise your song connects to the audience. You cannot measure your Return Of Investment of solemnly streams. There is way more if it comes to that. That's why I like the system of PP. They sent it to people who listens to your song and then decide if they want to place it or not. With that you are certain that if someone decides to place your song you hit the right audience which is key in building a solid fanbase.Nevertheless I ran into loads of comments/reviews that my music doesn't fit the style of the playlist ergo the tagging system of Playlist Push is weak. You pay a bunch of bucks (it's very expensive) to then been sent to the wrong people?! Their biggest flaw is that they tag your song per genre, but never per mood. My song was pushed to Chill Pop lists and they said that they loved it, but it's too energetic for their lists. And that's where your money goes down the drain.Playlist Push doesn't consider that small artist use their service. The big guys are backed by Spotify and their editorial lists. Just the small guys need a marketing that runs through private playlist placements and those small artist save up money for months to spend it then on one song. Seeing your carefully saved up money being flushed down the toilet hurts. So here is my advice improve your tagging system strongly so that the submitted songs land on the tables of curators that have a value for the artist. Also Small artist cannot afford your high prices that's why they chose small campaigns, nevertheless you should give them the same chance on being landed on your top playlists (big followership  ACTIVE listenership). It's not appealing to save up money for two months to get offered 10 playlist placements and 8 of those create 300 listeners in 1 1/2 month (review time of Playlist Push 2 weeks push, 4 weeks of accumulating stats and let the song grow).I still want to thank Playlist Push for the great communication!","i ran two campaigns with playlist push and while the idea of the service is what the music industry needs, their system to help you has a lot of flaws. here is my experiencein june i pushed a dance pop song. check juze - night shift if you need a reference.i used the smallest campaign for 380€ and a possible landing of 10 playlists. after two weeks (which is the normal push time for every campaign) i actually landed in 11 playlists. here are the stats - first number is listeners, second is streamshidden gems 			49 	       /      186marathon playlist			393	       /	499pop hits 2019			226	       /	414best 2019				228	       /	367chill house hits			1800	/	3200electronica 2019			40	       /	68happy summer beats		33	       /	39farofa pop				107	       /	153top hits (clean)			2200	/	6100charts august 2019		2000	/	3200new edm				440	       /	554total					7516	/	14780as you can see. 8 out of 11 playlists were pretty much dead. 380€ are quite expensive for those kind of statistics.nevertheless the service center of playlist push is pretty good as they offered me the same campaign for my next song for free to show their commitment.this time they pushed a very popish songs of mine. second song for reference juze - you don't need methey matched the reach of the campaign i was not happy about, so again 10 playlist placements and they only got 2 this time. those run right now for several weeks and are pretty much dead as well. review timefirst things first. i do like that pp is not offering a certain amount of streams for your money. that is never legit as no one can promise your song connects to the audience. you cannot measure your return of investment of solemnly streams. there is way more if it comes to that. that's why i like the system of pp. they sent it to people who listens to your song and then decide if they want to place it or not. with that you are certain that if someone decides to place your song you hit the right audience which is key in building a solid fanbase.nevertheless i ran into loads of comments/reviews that my music doesn't fit the style of the playlist ergo the tagging system of playlist push is weak. you pay a bunch of bucks (it's very expensive) to then been sent to the wrong people?! their biggest flaw is that they tag your song per genre, but never per mood. my song was pushed to chill pop lists and they said that they loved it, but it's too energetic for their lists. and that's where your money goes down the drain.playlist push doesn't consider that small artist use their service. the big guys are backed by spotify and their editorial lists. just the small guys need a marketing that runs through private playlist placements and those small artist save up money for months to spend it then on one song. seeing your carefully saved up money being flushed down the toilet hurts. so here is my advice improve your tagging system strongly so that the submitted songs land on the tables of curators that have a value for the artist. also small artist cannot afford your high prices that's why they chose small campaigns, nevertheless you should give them the same chance on being landed on your top playlists (big followership  active listenership). it's not appealing to save up money for two months to get offered 10 playlist placements and 8 of those create 300 listeners in 1 1/2 month (review time of playlist push 2 weeks push, 4 weeks of accumulating stats and let the song grow).i still want to thank playlist push for the great communication!"

The service has an excellent website with a very well designed and intuitive user interface to track your campaigns. You can view all of the playlist curators they have submitted to and the feedback from them. You can also see the list of all the curators who have added you to various playlists. The information displayed is correct because it ties in perfectly to what I see from the back end using Artists for Spotify. Of course, there is no guarantee. So you could end up spending a lot of money to have them push your music to a lot of curators, none of which decide to add the music to a playlist. This has happened to one of my songs. But as disappointing as this is, it shows that the service is genuine as it does not make dubious claims of ""guaranteed"" streams, followers and listeners which a lot of other promoters do. The music has to be picked up organically and I find it hard to believe that there are can be guaranteed placements. So that is one of the reasons I trust the service.

5cdc3ef1a8436908e0b722f1,3,Moderate Results at a High Cost,"I work with a successful artist who is usually featured on Spotify official playlists. Relying on Spotify is risky, because you never know what their editorial team will do. So I tried Playlist Push to see if it could help fill out our strategy.We ran two campaigns around $2000-3000. Both times, they were good to add tens of thousands of listeners. There was a range of smaller and bigger playlists. Some were relevant to our music, and probably just as many were not. For comparison, we got the same number of spins from a few regional playlists curated by Spotify.For further comparison, I've had past songs picked up by Spotify's editorial team for bigger playlists, for hundreds of thousands of spins. Playlist push can't do that (and didn't do that for these songs). And understandably so. Spotify is still the king of their own ecosystem, and those bigger placements are highly prized, and at the whim of the editorial team.What about Spotify's algorithmic playlists? Playlist push didn't seem to help there either. Sometimes if your song starts trending, it will become a candidate for bigger Spotify official playlists. But Playlist Push didn't get us there. And granted, that's a big thing to hope for. But again, I can compare that to a meeting I took with a lifestyle brand, leading to a feature on their branded playlist. It added decent numbers, but more importantly, seemed to create placements on Spotify's algorithmic playlists.

TLDR: we paid $2-3k for spins in the low 10 thousands. It didn't help us hit any official Spotify algorithmic playlists, let alone editorial. But the spins have some value.

If you are an artist who is just starting out, you may not get the same kind of results for a campaign as someone who's got a much bigger following.","my initial experience with playlist push was rather negative as the first track i submitted only got placed on a single, rather dubious playlist (and only stayed there for a few days). after pointing that out to the playlist push team i initially did not get a response. once i posted a (rather negative, as you can imagine) review on this site, i finally was contacted by someone from playlist push and things got better from that point on. they were helpful and supportive, and my next campaign yielded better results with placements on ""real"" playlists. part of the problem with my initial campaign might have been the choice of genres (which has been an issue for other users too, it seems). either way, once i got the attention of the playlist push support team, i was able to get satisfactory results in terms of playlist placements. bottom line this service can provide value for your money (it's not cheap) but there's no guarantee and you may need to engage with the playlist push support team. my main concern with a service like this one in general playlisters are interested in increasing traffic to their playlists, so they might be biased towards submissions from artists that already have a substantial number of followers. if you are an artist who is just starting out, you may not get the same kind of results for a campaign as someone who's got a much bigger following."

For instance, one of the playlists they pushed was an Instrumentals ONLY play list.  Being able to say have a filter that gets instrumental songs to those playlists and songs with singers/lyrics to the ones looking for them doesn't seem that hard to implement.

5bef1e2a9d378003581ed53c,3,My analyze and honest review.,"I know that the service is quite cheap - thats the reason I could afford it in the first place. It is actually a lot of money for me as a self releasing artist who doesnt really have a dime to spend on PR....But I thought that it would work out better. For what reason? Well - first of all for the song being accepted by you guys. That was a receipt for me. Receipt for that this song could actually be placed on some good spotify playlists.I knew that it is really tough to make it in on the lists and basically I think I believed in you and the song a little too much. When I analyze it - I thought the song was better than it is.The song made 1 list - a movie soundtrack list to a movie released in 1992. Thats just strange. I thought I paid for quality contacts... but hey It's a playlist. It has 5000 followers but as expected the song have had no more than about 30 listeners from that list.So what can you do better? Well - I really liked the final report with the comments. It would be an awesome service if you sent reports after every contact session. That way it is easy to see what you are doing for me and what I pay for. Who have you contacted and what lists are they having. I know that you do not want to give your customers too many details - cause the details and the contacts is what you make money from... but I mean - if you're transparent with that kind of stuff people will get really satisfied and really start to trust in you, then they will continue to use the service again and again. As for my next single - you are in the plans but I also look over other opportunities where I can be more involved and follow everything that is happening.

Mellanmjölk as we say in Sweden =)","i know that the service is quite cheap - thats the reason i could afford it in the first place. it is actually a lot of money for me as a self releasing artist who doesnt really have a dime to spend on pr....but i thought that it would work out better. for what reason? well - first of all for the song being accepted by you guys. that was a receipt for me. receipt for that this song could actually be placed on some good spotify playlists.i knew that it is really tough to make it in on the lists and basically i think i believed in you and the song a little too much. when i analyze it - i thought the song was better than it is.the song made 1 list - a movie soundtrack list to a movie released in 1992. thats just strange. i thought i paid for quality contacts... but hey it's a playlist. it has 5000 followers but as expected the song have had no more than about 30 listeners from that list.so what can you do better? well - i really liked the final report with the comments. it would be an awesome service if you sent reports after every contact session. that way it is easy to see what you are doing for me and what i pay for. who have you contacted and what lists are they having. i know that you do not want to give your customers too many details - cause the details and the contacts is what you make money from... but i mean - if you're transparent with that kind of stuff people will get really satisfied and really start to trust in you, then they will continue to use the service again and again. as for my next single - you are in the plans but i also look over other opportunities where i can be more involved and follow everything that is happening. as this was no success for me - i think that i could try something else in the same price category.well, that's my honest review about the service =)not unhappy at all but not overwhelmed either. mellanmjölk as we say in sweden =)"

5bc880df9d378004f01f68ed,4,Some Kudos and Some Concerns,"First off, let me clarify: I had two customer service-related experiences with you and they were both five star; I couldn’t ask for better support. Also I love your concept of operation and I really think it could be a great tool for us musicians who stand outside the algorithmic circle wondering what the hell is going on inside it, you know?That being said I think your genre targeting could use some fine tuning. I say this because I received a few reviews that were along the lines of “this is great but it doesn’t fit my playlist” and I looked to discover they were “pop” playlists when I most definitively did not submit the song in question for consideration by “pop” playlisters. I also had a song approved that I haven’t yet begun the campaign for because, frankly, there’s no way for me to meaningful pare down the genre beyond “rock” (it doesn’t fit the other categories you offer) and the campaign is prohibitively expensive as a result.When you price your service please also that Spotify streaming rates aren’t particularly artist-friendly; as I wrote you back in September: “I just had my song ‘Buffalo Head (Remastered)’ approved by your A&R team but if I select ‘rock’ – and only ‘rock’ – then your service quotes me a price of $460 to send the song out to ‘60 ~ 70 playlists targeted’.  I’d have to reach over 112K streams of ‘Buffalo Head’ just to break even at that $460 price and that number would actually have to be far higher in reality as it doesn’t even count CD Baby’s slice of my streaming pie.

I got suspicious they removed me after my reputation score stayed at zero after a month of being on the platform despite it saying that you get 1000 points for each month you're a curator on their site. Maybe that's changed. An update about this would be good. Additionally, I was no longer receiving any song submissions despite receiving them daily for a month. If this is atypical, a statement about such on the site would be appreciated. And I emailed Ludo as the site said this was how curators should get in touch and I got no response. Then I tried their intercom on their website and had a response after about a day despite the fact it says they typically respond in minutes which gives a false expectation. The response was that my messages would be forwarded. I ended up getting a response from someone else about my concern on here where it's public. And it included a message with a link I hadn't seen before for curators as the site has separate sections which give different instructions on which email to use as a curator, and apparently my email wasn't found despite the fact from my end it went through fine.
