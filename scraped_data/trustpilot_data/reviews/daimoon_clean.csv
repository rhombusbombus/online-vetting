648ae109c53234132078b5ed,5,Daimoon Media's Spotify Bedroom Artist Plan is Awesome if you have a small Campaign Budget.,"The first campaign I ran with Daimoon Media was for my song To Be Rescued by Just Suddenly. It had 68 plays at the time. And within a month or two, the song has achieved 2500 plays and continues to grow every day. I have run 3 more song campaigns with Daimoon since then. I opted for the Bedroom Artist plan because it suits my budget the best. But I'm sure their bigger campaign plans are just as effective as the starter pack. The Campaign Supervisors are extremely friendly, very receptive, and provide timely replies. I've been analyzing and observing the playlists and streams for 4 months now and the results are consistent and bot free. When I ran my first campaign with Daimoon the only concern I had was, is it a scam, and will it help my artist profile grow organically once I stop the campaign. And I'm happy and relieved that Daimoon passed my expectation with flying colors. Being added to good playlists does trigger Spotify's Organic Algorithm and Spotify begins promoting your song through its Radio Feed. It's an extremely slow process though, but it's a good start. I love Daimoon Media and I am going to continue running every song's campaign with them. And you should totally try their services and use their playlist network to grow your audiences. I'm not saying Daimoon Media can do the impossible, they have limitations too. They weren't able to place some of my songs cause the curators did not feel the songs matched their playlists' vibe. But they tried their best and were transparent with the results. I will run out of words if I have to jot down all the Pros of running a campaign with Daimoon Media. And even if there are some Cons, there always are in a real-world scenario, the Pros outweigh the Cons by a huge margin. So, I'm going to totally recommend Daimoon Media's Spotify Campaign to every band/musician out there. And I am extremely happy with their pricing, services, and results. I hope you try them out at least once and see for yourself.

61e332c4e1196e51d76507d8,1,Fooled again,"I ran a completely separate second campaign with Daimoon Media after being contacted by their associate Luka. He attempted to win my business back by offering all kinds of things so when I decided to give them another shot I clarified quite a few of my original concerns. Luka assured me that they could easily reach the follower goal that I paid for and that the songs would be placed on relevant playlists within the agreed upon timeframe. My song was placed on 2 relevant playlists, still falling short of the follower goal. Then the day our agreed upon timeframe ended, before reaching the follower goal, the two playlists I was on immediately removed my song and totally changed their playlists to something completely opposite of the genre my music was featured on before. When I demanded a refund because what was promised was not delivered, Luka refused until I threatened to contest the charge with my bank. He continued to give a sob story about the company using their assets, resources, etc so I shouldn't be owed a refund.This company clearly is out to make money from artists whether they deliver their promised results or not. I made a mistake in running a second campaign with them and if I were you I would steer clear of this company.EDIT (Response to review comment):First I'd like to address the comment about me not leaving room for conversation. I communicated with the representative from this company for weeks sending numerous emails, we had plenty of conversation before and during the campaign. I was guaranteed that this campaign would reach the promised follower count. It did not. Second this company claims that I gained over 10,000 streams from their smaller playlists. This isn't true in any stretch of the imagination and there would be no way for this company to even remotely guess on the amount of streams I gained as they don't have access to my S4A stats. This is a blatant lie by this company. Third, I did demand a refund because the promised reach was not met. When asking for a refund on my previous campaign I was told I wouldn't be given one because the agreed upon follower count was reached. So when on this campaign it was not reached I expected a refund as that is what I was told was the issue in the previous campaign. Now, just as I stated earlier, this company wants to take money from artists whether or not they do what they agreed to do.

I was cheated out of my money. They did a horrible job and I'm never going to use them again. They provided bots to my song & the bots spam my message box on Soundcloud. They accused me of not understanding their rules. I am still not satisfied with the results. I still want my refund. I'm not going to let this go.,i was not satisfied with this site at all. i started out with a small campaign. i wasn't expecting much and the service i received was below that. the campaign's plays seemed to be bots and came from the same places like indonesia. many of the accounts removed the reposts. they mentioned a partial refund if customers are not satisfied but it is a lie because i couldn't get my money back when i emailed them that i was not satisfied. (f-)edit i have been busy and i'm just now responding back to this company's non-response. this company responded back but my response is still the same. i didn't get my money back. i was cheated out of my money. they did a horrible job and i'm never going to use them again. they provided bots to my song & the bots spam my message box on soundcloud. they accused me of not understanding their rules. i am still not satisfied with the results. i still want my refund. i'm not going to let this go.
