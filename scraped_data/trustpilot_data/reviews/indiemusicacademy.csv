Regardless the fact that the playlist was very weird. I’m not an expert some people told me it looks fake, I really didn’t get any real engagement as I got on other playlists that has nothing to do with indiemusic, and the MAIN THING, It’s sooooooo expensive for what it is.

I started out as a member of the Indie Growth Coaching Community 3 years ago and found immense value in the Song Launch Formula, which was a course built into that community. I was also super impressed with Ryan Waczek's teaching and the amount of attention he gave each student. Later I took the Music Selling Through Storytelling course, which massively improved my copywriting skills and made all my communications with my fans better. Since then I've also used the IMA's Spotify promotion service and was very happy with the communication from the team. I had one of my songs placed within 2 days the first time and the second time it took a few months for my song to be placed (but I understand that's the nature of influencer marketing).

My advice to indie music academy: spend more time with your clients, automate less, and actual interact with customers.

He taught me how to run successful FB ads, along with the importance of using those ads to build an email list of fans.

I still use this invaluable tool for every song I release. Since starting to work with Ryan just three years ago, I’ve been able to SUCCESSFULLY release 11 new singles -- with 10 of the 11 playlisted on Spotify with real, generic streams.

64c06970d687d46424ecf125,5,This Course is Too Good,"I've been refraining from giving this course a review until now, for selfish reasons. Why should I voluntarily give any of my competitors one ""leg up""? But my moral conscience got the better of me.Granted I am self-admitted cynic and don't like to be marketed to. Ryan and his clan had been emailing me via autoresponder messages about several course promotions for over 18 months. The one time I didn't ignore or blow his team off, I wrote back directly and my attitude was not very nice. Until one day in late January 2023, I happened to see an ad for his Spotify Growth Formula (SGF), and for some inexplicable reason (was I on vacation and in a ""good mood""?), I decided to ""take a chance"". What I found out quickly (and still am finding) is that SGF is too good. I'd never had prior success with ads. Quickly immersing myself completely in the content and never looking back, over the past 5 + months I've followed Ryan's amazing tutorials and calls to the ""T"", plus along with supplementing my own techniques using my own intuition, I have now become a Facebook Ads ""Ninja""! My Facebook Ad Analytics have been ""off the charts"" and my Spotify has been steadily growing. The online community is also awesomely helpful, and I've learned even more by volunteering myself as a contributor. Plus, Ryan is a super nice guy, and interactive with the community.",2023-07-26T02:31:44.000Z,"July 25, 2023",Off the Hook,2,US,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/64c06970d687d46424ecf125,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5f829b749bbc0d001aa03c8e
643dfe9d05faeda7356c6092,5,The First & Best Move for any Indy Artist Begins Here,"Firstly, I don't normally write reviews.Secondly, I'm a skeptic at heart, and not normally or easily impressed.  There are many, many DIY programs designed for independent artists these days.  But, in Ryan, you have not only found a tech/ marketing genius, you have not only found a fellow artist.. you have found an articulate, empathetic young man whose true calling in life is teaching, nurturing, and supporting fellow artists and like-minded souls.  Many online programs will tell you how many ""thousands of dollars"" can be made as an indy artist. But, Ryan has created a college-level course which actually walks you through the process step by step. You will not only learn basic marketing skills, you will not only learn how to navigate the Meta Facebook universe, but, you will also learn the very same marketing & business techniques used by record companies today to promote their artists. Ryan gives you the tools you need to be successful in today's market.  And he has also created a community of knowledgeable, artistic souls who are eager to help and offer guidance.I strongly urge every indy artist to sign up for this program.  Again.. I do not work for Ryan, and he is not paying me to say this. But, I'm gonna say this:  ""If you are an indy artist and do not take this course, you are not giving yourself a real chance for success in this lifetime.""

One of the best people I’ve found helping Indie Artists find their way.I’ve been following Ryan and watching Indie Music Academy YouTube videos for over 2 years. He showed me how to spot and stay away from bot Spotify playlists, which distributors were right for our music and most recently taught me how to use Facebook ads to find the right audience for our music. I joined the first ever group for his Spotify Growth Formula class and have found it to be incredible. I’ve talked to many…many support reps at Facebook and no one knows more about the Facebook ads engine and how to strategize to find the best audience for your music than Ryan. I got so much out of the first Spotify Growth Formula class that I joined the second group and plan to continue meeting with Ryan and the other students in the community he’s set up for us to share what we’ve learned as we continue to become more experienced Facebook advertisers and musicians.Ryan is legit and gets results.

The Formula and setup works amazing and Ryans lessons are step by step and easy to follow.Put the music out there, to a LOT of people -  the results are down to us!

SGF gives us the pro tools to promote ourselves - biggest question is, now WE can do it,  ""can we handle the truth"" ha!.The technical side of the course opens the door to people to ""audition"" our songs, but can't force people to click over , stream , follow and all that.This is where the community comes in, spurring each other on to try new ideas and learning by sharing our experiences and results.",2023-05-06T10:25:49.000Z,"May 05, 2023",Rob,1,GB,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/64556f082a4d68db33386980,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/643e912e10c4010012224e24

After my answer there was no answer from Mandy.Other companies respond within 24 or 72 hours. Therefore 0 stars in terms of contact.

Where do I sign? Then I heard nothing for 2 weeks. All I get are impersonal generic emails which are the same that they send out to everyone I'm sure. I sent an email saying that ""instead of asking for a refund, can we just switch songs for my campaign"". Maybe I'll have better luck getting placements for it....no response from anyone for 3 business days. You figure surely someone can check an email and respond by then right? Then I get another generic email saying ""how's everything going? If you need anything please don't hesitate to respond to this email"" So I responded with my frustration with the process thus far and would just like a refund at this point. Still haven't heard back from this email either. Why send a generic email and not deliver on its contents? Very frustrating and I feel like I can't get in touch with anyone to help resolve my issue.
