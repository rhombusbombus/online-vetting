64cd1326ce62b1a0e68cad7f,5,Excellent all round service,Used Omari for my 2nd and 3rd single and my experience was amazing. Songs were Christian/uplifting genre which were promoted on both Utube and Spotify. Started seeing results 1-2 days after it was processed. My Spotify view went from 5 views to 1200 views over a period of two weeks . Utube views from 65 views to 1200 within 2 days still counting. Utube promotion only last up to 7 days ( for the bronze package)however so bear this in mind . I was  satisfied with their service so I used them for my 3rd single. I will use them again . Great communication too no question was a silly question. They  responded to my emails queries promptly which helped reduce any worries😊.

I have ordered their spotify Promo for 5 songs now and I have to say what they offer is incredible. I will say to anyone interested to be REASONABLE with your expectations.

Some songs I submitted performed better than others but even the ones that did not perform well gave me a better understanding of what aspects of my sound DO and DON'T work. They will absolutely introduce your music to a very large audience and you will get natural listens, not bots. There is a lot of potential to grow your audience with what they offer.

648b97a5c11ec5bb50b71fd7,5,INTEGRITY,"INTEGRITY!  That is the first word that came to mind when I thought about reviewing this service.  When I first saw advertisements on YouTube for OmariMC and heard that he did not promote music with profanity in it, I at first was taken aback because I thought it was a bit of an affront to creative freedoms that artists hold so dear.  But, after examining even the lines I've drawn in the sand about not promoting music that glorifies murder and various other social ills, I recognized something familiar...a person and company that holds certain things at higher value than money.  The thing that initially gave me pause when considering hiring them wound up being the very same thing that made me decide to contract them.  It was the feeling that I could trust them to stand by their word and do what they said they could do.  After using their service, I was not wrong and they delivered the results with ease.

62aa5a5c266eedb3c15a8132,2,Know what you're getting into,"I recently used Omari for YouTube promotions. I'll preface this by saying that I don't think it's an absolutely terrible company as they will get you some form of results, and for music hobbyists that's better than nothing. However, serious customers should know what to expect when paying for expensive promotional packages and after having experience with OmariMC I feel there are both cheaper and more effective alternatives. I paid for Omari's YouTube promotion that estimated between 11,000 and 77,000 views. At the end of the promotion my song received less than 6,000 views from Omari's advertising, a painful underperformance for a high price tag. From the Omari promo I also saw that huge chunks of my views were coming from non-english speaking countries, which resulted in poor engagement numbers, high dislikes, and bad YouTube analytic data. I raised several questions with the company via email during the course of the promotion, and received relatively quick answers and temporary boosts to the results, but said results only lasted 3-4 days, not the duration of the campaign. Many of the days that my ad should've been running I received 0 views, and when I complained about my results I'd get a short boost of approximately 1,000 views from India or Italy over the course of an hour or two. After my promo package was up I decided to run my own YouTube ad, which wasn't very difficult to figure out, and received a much better subscriber-to-view ratio and like-to-view ratio for an affordable cost-per-view(approximately $0.04.) To give some context, before I ran my own ad my video had accumulated 6,500 views, 30 likes, and 9 dislikes from the Omari promo. When I created my own ad I reached 8,000 views, 65 likes, and kept my dislike count at 9. Omari sells itself as having specialized knowledge on how to run ads for genre specific music, but it needs to be said that this specialized marketing resulted in a worse overall performance than an ad I created with no previous experience with the YouTube ads platform. I've managed to offset the poor engagement I received from the Omari promo, but I'm sad that my music video had to receive all this bad, spammy data in the first place, simply because the targeting was recklessly created by OmariMC. I want to like Omari because I believe accessible music marketing companies are one of the most important tools an indie artist can have, but until their services become less sloppy, then I cannot in good faith recommend them.",2022-06-16T00:17:00.000Z,"June 16, 2022",Dave,1,US,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/62aa5a5c266eedb3c15a8132,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/62aa5a0f2e5d320012e30721,Know what you're getting into,know what you're getting into,"I recently used Omari for YouTube promotions.

Maybe they should focus less on crypto and more on the core of their business; marketing.Both times I purchased the $77 package, and both times had a conversion/listen rate of between $0.35 to $0.70 per play or per listener, and almost none of them actually come back to listen again.","meh. have tried to do promotion through omari twice now with very minimal results.first of all, their website is atrocious. it honestly looks like a scam website, and they really shove the whole crypto thing in your face, like no thanks, just want to pay money for the service you offer...  maybe they should focus less on crypto and more on the core of their business; marketing.both times i purchased the $77 package, and both times had a conversion/listen rate of between $0.35 to $0.70 per play or per listener, and almost none of them actually come back to listen again."

626965610c4813f76bf65712,1,Very disappointed overall,"I am rather disappointed with my experience using Omari MC. They have a policy for no explicit language in the music. This is totally fair, however my first campaign with them was cancelled as my song apparently spoke of ""illegal drugs"" when it was in reference to medication to deal with depression for a suicide awareness song. They were rather rude to deal with and no matter how much I explained what the song was about, they refused to promote it.I gave the service the benefit of the doubt and organized a second campaign for a more upbeat song. The song was approved and added to a number of playlists, however each playlist only generated a few streams at best, except one or two playlists that generated a larger number of streams. In total, the streams generated barely met the minimum number of streams they estimate from the campaign. I mentioned that I was a little disappointed with the results for the amount of money spent in the kindest way possible and the response I received was arrogant as Omari MC have the impression that they are the only organic promotion service. This is completely untrue. There are a number of great services out there offering even more organic results and much better customer service.I never leave bad reviews, but after two bad experiences with a service that brags about being the best, I feel like I need to warn people thinking about using the service. As you can see from other reviews here, they will put down your music before taking any responsibility if the results are not great. There are much better services out there so don't waste the money.*UPDATE: Their response to my review below proves my point completely. a 1,000 - 10,000 stream range is a joke and you'll barely receive the 1,000. Most of the playlists you can submit to for free and I did this before purchasing a campaign. It's hard to tell if I received any results from Omari MC.

620425f5bc5a51af69bd7d9f,1,Terrible customer service - Try these companies instead!,"Terrible customer service.  Probably the worst I have ever dealt with. We recently submitted a song to OmariMC and received a message that since we used the word “damn”, they could not accept it. That was fine, although “damn” on its own is not considered an explicit lyric on all platforms in the industry. They agreed to a refund, but said there would be a fee for Palpal. I expressed that was unacceptable since it was misleading on the website. I researched prior to submitting to make sure “damn” was not explicit. After some back and forth and explaining this to them, it remained the same. Honestly you should go with a company with great customer service. Try Indie Music Academy.

It is not out of the ordinary to assume “no explicit content” means exactly what those standards would be, especially a from a company that is pitching music to the industry that has those exact standards. In addition, the word “damn”, among other words commonly used in the English language, is not always considered a “curse” word (I.e. why the music industry does not consider it explicit content).  I also told them, I recommend that they update their website to inform their customers that their ideas of “explicit content” does not line up with the “explicit content” by music industry standards, and then go into detail what those differences are (I.e. the word “damn” not being allowed). Only then will I believe they are being fair to their customers and not misleading them.

Probably the worst I have ever dealt with. We recently submitted a song to OmariMC and received a message that since we used the word “damn”, they could not accept it. That was fine, although “damn” on its own is not considered an explicit lyric on all platforms in the industry. They agreed to a refund, but said there would be a fee for Palpal. I expressed that was unacceptable since it was misleading on the website. I researched prior to submitting to make sure “damn” was not explicit. After some back and forth and explaining this to them, it remained the same. Honestly you should go with a company with great customer service. Try Indie Music Academy.

61d8a78ca16c1e751f626fa6,1,Didn't even get half their low end estimate,"They promised 500-1000 listens and provided less than 200. Not surprisingly because, as expected, they just put you on random playlists no one listens to. One playlist netted a whole 1 listen. The highest play count on any playlist was about a dozen. There's no confusing this. If thousands were subscribed to their playlists id have hit their target even if everyone person hated my song. More likely, they create the playlists you're submitting to and if anyone at all listens its other suckers who applied. Avoid at all costs.Edit: they claim they cannot guarantee results because, to be fair, your music might not be that good. Let's assume mine sucks and no one wants to hear it. That should generate more than a single listener, even if by accident. The problem is they're submitting your music to playlists no one listens to. Who makes these playlists? I can only assume they do. I was added to a playlist called ""cardio workout."" Not sure why, not that the song is appropriate for that, but I couldn't even find the playlist in a spotify search. Another I was added to was ""rock gaming music you'll love."" It has 960 likes lol. Another was literally called ""playlist1"" with a whopping 28 likes. In total I was added to 10 playlists. Half of which had plays in single digits. One hit 89 plays, nothing else came remotely close to that, with the runner up coming in at 16 plays (playlist had about 4k likes). I've been licensed by MTV and Red Bull in the past, so let's assume that even if you don't like my music it's not the worst ever recorded. This service, if you want to call it that, is clearly awful. Save your money. For what they charge you could hire a legit PR firm to get you actual results.

61d7d5d4a16c1e751f618d6f,1,A camouflaged scam,"I enlisted Omari on a trial basis to determine how legit their playlist pitch service is when it comes to spotify. The company claims that it will pitch your song to x number of playlists with no guarantee as to how many will add your song and no guarantee of how many spins it will get. This is both true and false. X, of course, is determined by how much you pay for the service. More pay for the promo, more playlists they pitch to. Makes business sense, especially the way they do it.Omari will get you some spins. Those spins will be based on how much you pay. But the algorithm to locate your song for anyone searching for similar music will be screwed. Omari clearly has a group of playlists that they place your song in and when the campaign expires, all of the playlists drop it that day. That was the final clue I needed to determine that I will not use the service again. Other clues were the playlists that my song ended up in. A number of them made no sense for the song's subject matter or genre. (Sad country song about spending the last bit of time with a father figure finding its way into a Forest Gump Soundtrack playlist)(at least try to hide it...)Moral of the story: you will get some spins. They don't mean anything. The cost of the service will not return anywhere near the amount of spins needed to pay itself off and since these spins and playlists end the day your payment runs out, that's all there is. There are no residual spins because ALL of the playlists drop you immediately. Good luck.Edited to add: $147 campaign didn't even reach their base of 1,000 streams. Missed that mark by close to 300.Reply:I'll send you the proof for missing the mark. Hexk, you can look at the overall numbers today and see the song still isn't at 1000. This confirms the ROI argument. Your company does not create organic growth. It creates a boost in spins during the time of the campaign and then ends. Just because you've got people on the payroll in different cities playing through the playlists doesn't make it legit. Technically, those are not bots, but technically, those are not organic either.As I said, I will send your proof, but as I stated in my email, I don't want to the campaign extended.

Omari MC is certainly free to shout their backwards Christian speeches/art from rooftops but when they refuse and openly deny service to others with other spiritual beliefs (and sexual preference - go dig people there are plenty of other bad reviews out there that share our opinion of Omari MC) that is not just bigoted but unlawful.","this company judges and discriminates against other faiths and spiritual beliefs. their words ""we are a christian faith-based company, and unfortunately, this type of content and symbolism does not align with our views and we are not comfortable promoting on our platform.""albeit, our symbolism does include an enigmatic seven-point star (also used in christianity, sheriff departments, and thousands of other uses), we use this geometric shape in our band's logo and we are not satanic devil worshipers like they insinuate. that said, even if we were satanic this sort of discrimination is straight-up sectarian bigotry. they have made assumptions, stereotyped us, and refused to promote our music on the basis that they do not share our spiritual beliefs - without even know what they are.they did back-peddle to say that they were not discriminating because they were willing to promote other material of ours (after clearly saying they wouldn't because of our logo) and also said that our titles ""ghosts of treason"" and ""mystic spy"" stood against their values (???). i'm not sure what sort of assumptions they are making around these titles but our logo is on everything we do, like any company, so it's clear they would refuse anything we were to submit unless we compromised our artistic integrity to fit their ignorant, misinformed, and intolerant platform.  i've given them two stars because, at least, they refunded our money. avoid this bigotted company at all costs if you value freedom of speech and expression.re in response to theirs below- “it is the content, not the persons.” our music and art is part of our spirituality, it is not “vulgar,” nor is it evil and (make no mistake) omari mc has refused to serve us because of bigotry and ignorance. the two way street they refer to below is also not how this works when you provide a public promotional service to artists. omari mc is certainly free to shout their backwards christian speeches/art from rooftops but when they refuse and openly deny service to others with other spiritual beliefs (and sexual preference - go dig people there are plenty of other bad reviews out there that share our opinion of omari mc) that is not just bigoted but unlawful."

They offer free advice on youtube all the time, information that is real and they are here to actually provide real information.  I've been in the business for over 10 years and a lot of this stuff was not available when i started.  And although i am an established independent artist that make a full time living off music, i like companies like omaris because they actually will help you up your game and take things to another level.  My goal is to get my funnels and overall brand up to a million a year.  Yes that is my goal and I see it happening.  I take a lot of different courses and masterclasses from many different places , so i can be a witness that omari mc is offering the real deal stuff.  For any of you who complain and don't want to put in the work and expect something overnight, yea don't waste your money , but for those of you who are serious about your business, take advantage of all the info omari mc gives and get their information, pay for coaching.  you're better off with that than streams.  Spotify IS NOT the primary place for people to get discovered.  spotify is a RESULT of your work that you've put in elsewhere.  You're better off spending your money on coaching and getting help to build your brand, your business.  You all should be having an active email list and engage your fan base and your customers.  If you had just 100 people who spent 100 dollars in a year, that's 10,000.  Stop thinking small and start thinking about your careers long term.  I don't want to say my name on here, but my career is popping.  I have some major publications that are coming out including forbes, rollin stone and billboard in which i'm in all of those coming up.  So i know what i'm talking about.  Learn the MUSIC BUSINESS from omari mc.  Pay for the coaching. The information they are telling you is real.  I normally don't write reviews, but i'm sick of these artist who are lazy and don't want to put in the work.  You just want to get streams just to validate your ego.  Look, if your song is really popping yea they will leave you on the playlist longer.  I tried omari before, and even though they say it can fall off after 2 to 4 weeks, it is STILL ON THE PLAYLIST EVERY SINCE APRIL.  With constant real streams.  no FAKE BUFFALO CITY streams.  All you have to do is go to a profile and look at the city.  If the numbers are realistic you know its real.  100 from this place, 100 from that.  None of omari stuff say thousands from buffalo.  Thats how you know its real.  So take this priceless information in this review.  Build your email list.  Build your website.  Stop expecting a handout.  I put 16 hours a day multiple days a week into building my brand, hoaning my craft and its paying off.  All you have to do is be realistic and put in your time and it will pay off.  Trust me it will.  So it's time to act like business people and get the information that will help you.  Get business info from omari ASAP.  Pay them for coaching.  Do what you need to do to get that right mindset so that you can think like a business person.   And keep in mind that number i gave you.  100 people paying 100 per year is 10K.  that's like a part time job.  And if you can get a 100, then you can get to a 1000 people.

60f6bf0df9f48709d4b9d0ab,1,"Sketchy (probably fake) Results, terrible customer support","It started with me requesting a silver YouTube campaign, with a rush (which is what I normally ask for). I got the confirmation that the order was processed a day later, and I was expecting to start seeing my views increase 1-2 days later. After 4 days, I still hadn't seen any results whatsoever. The views I got on the video were very low. I emailed support, and Taylor responded, saying that the ad was moving to a crawl, and he changed some of the configurations on the promo. He told me I should start seeing results within a day, but to email him 3 days later if I still hadn't seen any change. 3 days later, there's no change. I email him again. This time, he punts me to Jaron, their marketing manager. 7 hours later, I get this from Jaron: ""Hi, I have made adjustments for your campaign. Talk soon, Jaron"". That's it, no details as to what went wrong, no apology, no insight as to when things should improve, or how confident he was that he actually found the problem. Seemed to me like he had no idea what to do. Turns out, I was right. I responded asking for more details. He told me my ad had ""stalled"" and that he increased the CPV and adjusted keywords. I responded by thanking him and asking if I could at least get a credit for the rush option I paid for, given this was a week and a half after I placed the initial request, and the campaign should already be done by now. Furthermore, I didn't ask for a refund, I asked them to give me a free rush on the next campaign I was going to pay for a few days later (This is a $17 value, and at this point in the year, I've used them for over $2K in promos - not exactly a demanding request). He responded by saying: ""Our rush order only pertains to us replying to and accepting the promotion within 24 business hours. However, as a gesture of good faith I will honor your request"". Note still no apology, or any indication that they took accountability for the problem. 4 days later, I had to email him again, saying it still wasn't fixed, I asked him if maybe the campaign wasn't placed correctly from the start. At this point, Jaron responds with: ""This should allow for the campaign to run successfully. It is not always an issue of the campaign being set up correctly or incorrectly. There are a lot of varying factors when it comes to running successful campaigns as the market/competition is always evolving."" He also tells me that in the two weeks since I placed the request, the number of views from their service was 75. That was his way of telling me the campaign was ""working"", but it needed ""tweaking"" (his words). Think about that. Based on this explanation, it's ""normal"" to see campaigns underperform so significantly. These things can happen whenever the market fluctuates. I had to monitor it myself and contact support so that Omari would look at it. That means that if you pay for a campaign, you could get the thousands of views they promise you, or you could get 75... and if YOU don't notice it, or if you're running multiple promo campaigns and don't see that the Omari campaign isn't working, they won't do anything about it pro-actively. So you can't trust their service. What happened next was very interesting. Within the span of 60 minutes, the video got 2200-2300 views in one shot, and then it completely stopped. What's even weirder is that out of those views, I didn't get a single subscriber, or even a like (or comment). I realize that the campaign doesn't guarantee subscribers. That's not my issue. I have about 800 subscribers and about 70,000 views in total since the start of my channel. That means 1 in 87.5 views generate a subscriber (on average). While the results can vary, let's simply agree that 0 subscribers on 2200 views is just not realistic. It's a clear sign of fake views. It's been 24 hours since thes 2200 views and the numbers stalled again completely. I've paid over $160 for this promo, I've gotten a fraction of the views they tell you you're getting, and I'm not getting any legitimate help from their customer support, who doesn't want to acknowledge that they screwed up somewhere. The sad part is up until now, I planned on using them as a key part of my marketing strategy when it comes to YouTube, but now, I wouldn't use them again even if it was free. Nathaniel, what's the point of doing all of this add-value stuff like publishing advice for content creators on your YouTube channel, when you can't deliver on your core products, and have a crappy support team. I thought you were smarter than that.Update: So Jaron, how do you explain the 2200 views in a single hour and then a total stop. Google ads doesn't work that way.

However, after using Omari Promotion, there has been an increase of 687 monthly listeners within a couple of weeks bringing streams up 90%!!! Also, the promoted songs by Nick Michigan have been added to at least 31 playlists making it possible for more potential fan reach and more sales.

At the end of the day, you're the artist, you've made the art; the service just has the contacts - they're doing business, not lending you a favour. I prefer Omari's 'calling it what it is' approach.  Tiers of pricing are accessible (I dipped a toe in initially going for a test run with the lowest band promo on a track to see how it went) and the service seems to go over and above where possible to deliver your music to playlists. Now that I'm satisfied with the service and trust it more, I've just started a Gold Spotify playlisting campaign. Interested to see how this grows my listener base.","after a couple months of sleuthing through all the pros and cons of a variety of playlist promotion services, i finally settled on omari. other services draw you in through their dynamic sales-pitchy marketing whereas omari's site follows a much more pragmatic approach. i'm generally a bit skeptical of playlist promotion sites. i hate the overly enthusiastic narrative of 'look what we can make happen for you' (for lots of $$$/£££).omari's site doesn't do this. at the end of the day, you're the artist, you've made the art; the service just has the contacts - they're doing business, not lending you a favour. i prefer omari's 'calling it what it is' approach.  tiers of pricing are accessible (i dipped a toe in initially going for a test run with the lowest band promo on a track to see how it went) and the service seems to go over and above where possible to deliver your music to playlists. now that i'm satisfied with the service and trust it more, i've just started a gold spotify playlisting campaign. interested to see how this grows my listener base."

6089921af9f4870984ae55d8,1,Scam!,"I started a Spotify campaign 2 days ago. To my surprise, on the very first day of the campaign, I was added to 33 playlists and I thought, wow, this really works! but I decided to check what kind of lists they were and this is what I found:1- Despite my music being  alternative metal, most lists were related to a different genre, which makes me think that they dont have a clue  about what they are sending to the lists.

6040e40af85d75064c374adf,4,This is my second review,"This is my second review of the Omari services. My genre is typically singer songwriter. The first time, I said that Omari does what it promises. I still stand by that. Don't get your hopes up too high though, because my Spotify campaigns only generated about 1500 to 2000 streams (and a considerable number of saves) per song. This does not apply to my YouTube campaigns, however, because they ended up higher (even up to 6000), with the necessary new followers on my YouTube channel as well. Meanwhile, I can somewhat compare Omari with Playlist Push. With the latter, I spent a lot more money for a Spotify campaign, which resulted in a lot less streams. Playlist Push does give you serious feedback from playlist curators. But if it turns out that a large majority of the curators found my song very good (with arguments), but - despite my critical choise of playlist genres - not suitable for their playlist, you wonder if the pitch of Playlist Push is really adequate. In my case it is not. In that respect, Omari scores better. My experience with Omari is that sometimes - especially in YouTube campaigns - they are a little sloppy about tapping into enough target locations which can slow the performance down. You have to pay close attention to that.

I got the basic package for Spotify promo for my pop-rock/indie pop song. I recommend sending over the lyrics when ordering just to be safe since they only promote clean music. My only complaint with the service was that I had to follow up with them after 2 weeks because it seems that after I sent them my lyrics, my song/email just got left on the backburner and promotion was never started on the song.But ignoring that snafu, once promo started I was very impressed. While I was surprised my pop-rock song was being added to Rap/Hip Hop playlists, I emailed the team and within a day my song was being added all over the place to workout, high energy, and feel good playlists. My song doubled in saves during the month of promotion, and even now, is still on all the playlists despite the promo starting over a month ago. While the estimate for this package starts around 500 plays, my song is near 1000 at this point.I look forward to using their services again in a few weeks for my next song.

60310298f85d7509d8df015f,1,"Resulted in distributor freezing account for ""fraudulent streaming""","I have used only Omari MC for Spotify because of its promise of organic promotion. My first campaign was in summer 2019. It was not originally bad: a single 150k placing would steadily get me 150 saves (better than nothing for my genre), and these tracks are still listened now giving 15 streams per month per track meaning those were genuine listeners. However recently (late 2020 when my last campaign started) everything changed. The same playlist I relied on before gave me 5-10 times fewer plays, while new playlists they started to use resulted in an unusually high number of plays with 750 saves. Sounds great; the only issue was that last month there was not a single play from those 750 saves. And during the promotion I got 500 more followers, but exactly on the day the promotion ended, instead of flattening the followers started to drop until every single one of those 500 disappeared. This was a clear evidence there were fake plays used, and these were used by their playlists, not some independent ones (as they claimed) since those had just a score of streams and did not remove the track on the same day as their playlists. I complained, they said they vet all playlists for organic growth, after this fake pays/followers did not repeat. But it was too little too late: Even before the whole 4 track campaign ended, my music distributor took down all my albums, freezing my account and accusing me in ""fraudulent streaming"" to my utter  distress (I struggled to eat for 2 weeks after that as it was so shocking and unfair).UPDATE: I have read your reply:1. All my tracks are still there since I moved the distributor immediately after the previous one took down all albums. So it took 2 days to restore all tracks. I managed to restore statistics on Spotify, but on Deezer I lost all album fans. All statistics show a 1-2 days fall to 0. I can forward you the email from my previous distributer if you do not believe me.2. The fact that my track appeared on another playlist does not explain why fake followers started to drop on the day my campaign with you ended and not on any other day. If the fake follower were coming from a 3rd party playlist, then their dynamics would have not correlated with your campaign at all.

602c7d85679d9708b4d8a852,5,"Spotify playlisting service is top notch, but could use some tweaking.","We have used Omari several times to promote our EDM artist from our label.  We started out using the most inexpensive package as a test to see if Omari was legit.  And we have determined that this service IS LEGIT. Listen, promoting a new artist or starting out as a new artist is hard and getting a following is even more difficult.  Omari does what he says.  He gets songs on playlists.   In our experience we have received plays, song saves and some subscribers.   We have used the service a couple of times for the same artist...  on each occasion the songs were placed on the same playlists with the same themes.. which I was not impressed by.  I was hoping for new playlists with maybe new themes to reach a new audience.  I am not saying they didnt do the job, its just the playlists themselves had a wide variety of music genres on them and that our tracks may not have fit with all of the songs on the playlist that the song was on.  Having said that, some of the smaller playlists the song appeared on were more targeted toward the dance/edm genres which offered us less plays but more targeted listeners.   The playlists are real.  The listeners are real.   That's important.  My only critique is that sometimes the songs land on massive playlists with lots of followers but there are so many songs on the playlist that getting a decent amount of plays can be hard to come by over 2-3 week period.  Just because you have playlist with 20k followers doesnt mean they are listening to every song.  Remember, lots of people use the shuffle feature so its possible that your song may not even get played to them.  Also I doubt all 20k people are listening to that playlist during that 2-3 week period.  So while this is a great service, it can be improved by more targeted playlists with fewer songs and more listeners.   Kind of hard to come by these days on Spotify.  But in the end we come back to Omari because A) His service is honest.  B) We realize that it takes awhile to build an audience for a new artist, it wont happen over night and getting lots of song saves and being playlisted on personal playlists have definitely come from Omari's promotions.  C) He does not use BOTS...  Beware of services offering 5000+ plays on your track.  Its not real.  I'd rather have 100 real listeners liking the track and putting it in their playlist and telling their friends then fake bots playing tracks to up the play count.   Spotify's algorithm wont pick up the plays and suggest the track to others because the people who are playing the tracks are fake accounts who listen to 20 different genres of music.  D) Omari is Christian...  I would rather do business with a Christian..than with someone who is lying to me. For a Christian to base his entire business around lies would mean he is not a Christian in the first place.  So we trust that he is doing the job he says he is... If he were lying then I'd say eventually the truth would be revealed.  We have used a ton of different promotional companies to promote different styles of music on Spotify.  Most are fake or yield horrible results.  Omari yields results.  Is his service expensive?  Yes.  Will you get on playlists?  Yes.  Will you get followers?  That all depends on how good your music is and if you're on the right playlist.  Will you get plays?  Yes.   Will you get song saves?   Depends on how good your music is.   Will you go viral and be the next big thing?  Probably not.  But if you look into the other promotional companies around today, they are either stealing  your money or simply cannot compete with Omari's service.   We have yet to use his services for anything other than Spotify.  So I cannot comment on his other services.  Our recommendation is that you give this service a shot.

If you have problems I know for certain a HUMAN will respond to your inquiry at his website.","we have used omari several times to promote our edm artist from our label.  we started out using the most inexpensive package as a test to see if omari was legit.  and we have determined that this service is legit. listen, promoting a new artist or starting out as a new artist is hard and getting a following is even more difficult.  omari does what he says.  he gets songs on playlists.   in our experience we have received plays, song saves and some subscribers.   we have used the service a couple of times for the same artist...  on each occasion the songs were placed on the same playlists with the same themes.. which i was not impressed by.  i was hoping for new playlists with maybe new themes to reach a new audience.  i am not saying they didnt do the job, its just the playlists themselves had a wide variety of music genres on them and that our tracks may not have fit with all of the songs on the playlist that the song was on.  having said that, some of the smaller playlists the song appeared on were more targeted toward the dance/edm genres which offered us less plays but more targeted listeners.   the playlists are real.  the listeners are real.   that's important.  my only critique is that sometimes the songs land on massive playlists with lots of followers but there are so many songs on the playlist that getting a decent amount of plays can be hard to come by over 2-3 week period.  just because you have playlist with 20k followers doesnt mean they are listening to every song.  remember, lots of people use the shuffle feature so its possible that your song may not even get played to them.  also i doubt all 20k people are listening to that playlist during that 2-3 week period.  so while this is a great service, it can be improved by more targeted playlists with fewer songs and more listeners.   kind of hard to come by these days on spotify.  but in the end we come back to omari because a) his service is honest.  b) we realize that it takes awhile to build an audience for a new artist, it wont happen over night and getting lots of song saves and being playlisted on personal playlists have definitely come from omari's promotions.  c) he does not use bots...  beware of services offering 5000 plays on your track.  its not real.  i'd rather have 100 real listeners liking the track and putting it in their playlist and telling their friends then fake bots playing tracks to up the play count.   spotify's algorithm wont pick up the plays and suggest the track to others because the people who are playing the tracks are fake accounts who listen to 20 different genres of music.  d) omari is christian...  i would rather do business with a christian..than with someone who is lying to me. for a christian to base his entire business around lies would mean he is not a christian in the first place.  so we trust that he is doing the job he says he is... if he were lying then i'd say eventually the truth would be revealed.  we have used a ton of different promotional companies to promote different styles of music on spotify.  most are fake or yield horrible results.  omari yields results.  is his service expensive?  yes.  will you get on playlists?  yes.  will you get followers?  that all depends on how good your music is and if you're on the right playlist.  will you get plays?  yes.   will you get song saves?   depends on how good your music is.   will you go viral and be the next big thing?  probably not.  but if you look into the other promotional companies around today, they are either stealing  your money or simply cannot compete with omari's service.   we have yet to use his services for anything other than spotify.  so i cannot comment on his other services.  our recommendation is that you give this service a shot.  look at the playlists you are on.  see how many plays you get from these playlists.  keep notes.  and judge for yourself.  if you have problems i know for certain a human will respond to your inquiry at his website."

My name is Brick Casey, an independent artist who had really good results with Omari MC promotion services.To start, as many are, I too were a bit uncertain in paying for music promotion, (mostly out fear of Omari MC's services being a scam of some sort. Yet in realizing that to successfully market your music - YOU NEED PROMOTION (and a budget).As a multi-genre producer I found that Omari MC differentiates itself from the myriad of promo companies in that they, (Omari MC), doesn't simply take any and all money - which meant to me that the Omari MC marketing team has standards aka integrity. That's when I knew that this marketing company was for me, (as I hold a high regard of respect and integrity in my craft, and I like to surround myself with like-minded parties).In short, I ordered a Spotify Bronze Promo Package, (not expecting much as again I was a bit leery).Within 1 days I went from 5 to 25 followers. The stream count went from 2 to 56 and made 9 playlists all on this one account, (as I manage a couple of artists).To those who may not find this to be exciting news, I say simply look at the exponential metrics. With the least investment towards Omari MC's services, I was able to have organic growth in 7 day spread than I have had WITHOUT the service. (To me; it's simply smart business ethics to employ a reliable marketing company).That's why I've decide to revisit Omari MC for marketing services as well as write this review. For one I dont believe I was scammed in anyway and it's (Omari MC), an upstanding company that delivers. So as an artist it's only right that I share my experience with Omari MC to in some way set the record straight about any misconceptions about the company, (because trust me - I did my homework and a large part of my skepticism hinged on what Omari MC's competitors were saying about them).Yes I've also tried other companies prior and I found that at the end of the day if you as an artist are serious about your craft then you at some point will have to sit down and answer se hard questions about your marketing  campaigns. In closing I give a 5 Star review for two reason...1. Omari MC delivers results with its services.2. Omari MC is affordable, efficient and extremely resourceful as a marketing entity.

My LTR for this company is an absolute yes; I'm likely to recommend this company outright anytime for any artist who is looking to grow their fan base and expand their audience.Sincerely,Brick Casey","peace and blessings to you all. my name is brick casey, an independent artist who had really good results with omari mc promotion services.to start, as many are, i too were a bit uncertain in paying for music promotion, (mostly out fear of omari mc's services being a scam of some sort. yet in realizing that to successfully market your music - you need promotion (and a budget).as a multi-genre producer i found that omari mc differentiates itself from the myriad of promo companies in that they, (omari mc), doesn't simply take any and all money - which meant to me that the omari mc marketing team has standards aka integrity. that's when i knew that this marketing company was for me, (as i hold a high regard of respect and integrity in my craft, and i like to surround myself with like-minded parties).in short, i ordered a spotify bronze promo package, (not expecting much as again i was a bit leery).within 1 days i went from 5 to 25 followers. the stream count went from 2 to 56 and made 9 playlists all on this one account, (as i manage a couple of artists).to those who may not find this to be exciting news, i say simply look at the exponential metrics. with the least investment towards omari mc's services, i was able to have organic growth in 7 day spread than i have had without the service. (to me; it's simply smart business ethics to employ a reliable marketing company).that's why i've decide to revisit omari mc for marketing services as well as write this review. for one i dont believe i was scammed in anyway and it's (omari mc), an upstanding company that delivers. so as an artist it's only right that i share my experience with omari mc to in some way set the record straight about any misconceptions about the company, (because trust me - i did my homework and a large part of my skepticism hinged on what omari mc's competitors were saying about them).yes i've also tried other companies prior and i found that at the end of the day if you as an artist are serious about your craft then you at some point will have to sit down and answer se hard questions about your marketing  campaigns. in closing i give a 5 star review for two reason...1. omari mc delivers results with its services.2. omari mc is affordable, efficient and extremely resourceful as a marketing entity. my ltr for this company is an absolute yes; i'm likely to recommend this company outright anytime for any artist who is looking to grow their fan base and expand their audience.sincerely,brick casey"

So with that in mind, I decided to see what would happen if I let someone else submit my songs to playlists.

5ffcddb2755dc1032c13104f,4,Omari one of the safer bets in the playlist jungle,I make singer songwriter music with a (60’s 70s vibe. I  tried out Omari silver Spotify and Apple promotion in the summer and more recently the standard you tube promotion. I first researched and found Omari got good third party site reviews. There’s a lot of cowboys out there in playlist land so you need to be careful. The results numbers wise were not spectacular but they were spread across a number of playlists that gradually rose then fell after the promotion and in some cases lingered long after the promotion period. So all signs that there was real people listening. The save/ listener/ stream ratio All seemed in line with nothing untoward and spread over many different cities although predominantly US. The Apple promotion was much lower in numbers than Spotify don’t know if that’s just what you get with Apple Music.

5ff38b28755dc107e0d71881,1,"I Ordered The $1,800 Spotify Package Twice","One of the biggest regrets of my life: I used this service twice, maxing out at the highest available payment option, for two different genres of songs (pop and hip-hop) during two different periods of time (January 2020 and July 2020). Unfortunately, both focus groups had the same results. You’ll get an initial inflation of plays, monthly listeners, and saves, however when the promotion ends and the playlist curators remove your song, your numbers will plummet to near-zero (with the exception of the quantity of plays, of course). In my experience, bots are most likely to blame for this. In my case, for both songs, the monthly listeners increased to 20K-30K and the saves increased to 1K-2K, then, almost as if someone flipped a switch, my monthly listeners and favorites plummeted to almost exactly where I was before the campaign (around 1K monthly listeners and 10-20 saves per song). Monthly listeners (and especially saves) are supposed to slowly taper, not plummet - and especially not back down to where the song was before the campaign started. Keep in mind that the 2 songs that I chose to promote aren’t pieces of trash that I whipped up in my bedroom (or else I’d expect the numbers to plummet, because who would want to listen to them?). Both songs were professionally recorded, mixed and mastered in Nashville, with a variety of songwriters attached to each song. With a mainstream-sounding pop and hip-hop song being promoted, you’d expect some type of traction with this level of Spotify promotion package from Omari. This company really needs to flush out these third-party, botted Spotify playlists. I work 60-70 hours per week to fund the making and marketing of my music, and it's a shame that I've wasted thousands of dollars here.Omari will claim that your music is expected to reach a certain threshold of plays as ""proof"" that their service is legitimate. However, based on my experiences with other playlist-pitching services, I can absolutely guarantee you that, if the playlists that my song was placed into were either organically grown and/or weren't bot-infested, I wouldn't have seen such a sudden drop-off in saves and a complete snapback in monthly listeners (back to exactly where I was before the promotion started) once the promotion ended. One thing I forgot to mention that put the nail in the coffin: I spotted 2 playlists that had most of their followers erased. More specifically, ""Hip Hop Music"" and ""Chill Music 2020."" Both playlists had just under 100K followers when my singles were first placed into both playlists during both promotional periods. Then, suddenly, both playlists only had around a few dozen followers. Spotify frequently wipes out playlists that are spotted to host a mass amount of fake followers. As of writing this, it looks like both playlists are back up to a little over 1,000 followers, so it looks like EDM Hits (who owns both playlists) are trying to slowly artificially pump their numbers back up. These are just 2 examples; who knows how many other playlists that my songs were placed into also had their follower-count wiped out because of artificial inflation.Also, although it wasn't necessarily a dealbreaker for me, some people might have a problem with their music being placed in playlists that don't match their genre or feeling of the song. The hip hop track that I had promoted with Omari is dark and gritty (both production and lyricism), so to have it placed in ""Chill Music 2020"" had me scratching my head.Source: Without disclosing too much of my personal life, I worked in marketing (more specifically, streaming marketing) at one of the major labels, so I know a thing-or-two about playlisting and how the numbers should look once a song is either removed from or shuffled around a network of (legitimate) playlists.-----Update: Refunds are not issued to customers. Omari gauges the success of campaigns solely based off of the quantity of (botted) streams. I was under the impression that Omari’s campaign would’ve generated organic playlist traffic - if I wanted botted playlist traffic, I would’ve used a different company for much cheaper.  For those who don’t know (I’ve seen many 5-star reviews come in with people not knowing what they’re talking about after purchasing Omari’s Spotify campaign), the only way to differentiate organic versus inorganic traffic for playlist placements is not by quantity of streams, but by the health of the song once the track is removed from the playlist (analyzed through Spotify’s backend metrics and manually tracking statistics pre-and-post placements). I’m extremely disappointed. Good luck to those who still choose to opt in.

In my case, for both songs, the monthly listeners increased to 20K-30K and the saves increased to 1K-2K, then, almost as if someone flipped a switch, my monthly listeners and favorites plummeted to almost exactly where I was before the campaign (around 1K monthly listeners and 10-20 saves per song). Monthly listeners (and especially saves) are supposed to slowly taper, not plummet - and especially not back down to where the song was before the campaign started. Keep in mind that the 2 songs that I chose to promote aren’t pieces of trash that I whipped up in my bedroom (or else I’d expect the numbers to plummet, because who would want to listen to them?). Both songs were professionally recorded, mixed and mastered in Nashville, with a variety of songwriters attached to each song. With a mainstream-sounding pop and hip-hop song being promoted, you’d expect some type of traction with this level of Spotify promotion package from Omari. This company really needs to flush out these third-party, botted Spotify playlists. I work 60-70 hours per week to fund the making and marketing of my music, and it's a shame that I've wasted thousands of dollars here.Omari will claim that your music is expected to reach a certain threshold of plays as ""proof"" that their service is legitimate. However, based on my experiences with other playlist-pitching services, I can absolutely guarantee you that, if the playlists that my song was placed into were either organically grown and/or weren't bot-infested, I wouldn't have seen such a sudden drop-off in saves and a complete snapback in monthly listeners (back to exactly where I was before the promotion started) once the promotion ended. One thing I forgot to mention that put the nail in the coffin I spotted 2 playlists that had most of their followers erased. More specifically, ""Hip Hop Music"" and ""Chill Music 2020."" Both playlists had just under 100K followers when my singles were first placed into both playlists during both promotional periods. Then, suddenly, both playlists only had around a few dozen followers. Spotify frequently wipes out playlists that are spotted to host a mass amount of fake followers. As of writing this, it looks like both playlists are back up to a little over 1,000 followers, so it looks like EDM Hits (who owns both playlists) are trying to slowly artificially pump their numbers back up. These are just 2 examples; who knows how many other playlists that my songs were placed into also had their follower-count wiped out because of artificial inflation.Also, although it wasn't necessarily a dealbreaker for me, some people might have a problem with their music being placed in playlists that don't match their genre or feeling of the song. The hip hop track that I had promoted with Omari is dark and gritty (both production and lyricism), so to have it placed in ""Chill Music 2020"" had me scratching my head.Source Without disclosing too much of my personal life, I worked in marketing (more specifically, streaming marketing) at one of the major labels, so I know a thing-or-two about playlisting and how the numbers should look once a song is either removed from or shuffled around a network of (legitimate) playlists.-----Update Refunds are not issued to customers. Omari gauges the success of campaigns solely based off of the quantity of (botted) streams. I was under the impression that Omari’s campaign would’ve generated organic playlist traffic - if I wanted botted playlist traffic, I would’ve used a different company for much cheaper.  For those who don’t know (I’ve seen many 5-star reviews come in with people not knowing what they’re talking about after purchasing Omari’s Spotify campaign), the only way to differentiate organic versus inorganic traffic for playlist placements is not by quantity of streams, but by the health of the song once the track is removed from the playlist (analyzed through Spotify’s backend metrics and manually tracking statistics pre-and-post placements). I’m extremely disappointed. Good luck to those who still choose to opt in. You’ve been warned.","one of the biggest regrets of my life i used this service twice, maxing out at the highest available payment option, for two different genres of songs (pop and hip-hop) during two different periods of time (january 2020 and july 2020). unfortunately, both focus groups had the same results. you’ll get an initial inflation of plays, monthly listeners, and saves, however when the promotion ends and the playlist curators remove your song, your numbers will plummet to near-zero (with the exception of the quantity of plays, of course). in my experience, bots are most likely to blame for this. in my case, for both songs, the monthly listeners increased to 20k-30k and the saves increased to 1k-2k, then, almost as if someone flipped a switch, my monthly listeners and favorites plummeted to almost exactly where i was before the campaign (around 1k monthly listeners and 10-20 saves per song). monthly listeners (and especially saves) are supposed to slowly taper, not plummet - and especially not back down to where the song was before the campaign started. keep in mind that the 2 songs that i chose to promote aren’t pieces of trash that i whipped up in my bedroom (or else i’d expect the numbers to plummet, because who would want to listen to them?). both songs were professionally recorded, mixed and mastered in nashville, with a variety of songwriters attached to each song. with a mainstream-sounding pop and hip-hop song being promoted, you’d expect some type of traction with this level of spotify promotion package from omari. this company really needs to flush out these third-party, botted spotify playlists. i work 60-70 hours per week to fund the making and marketing of my music, and it's a shame that i've wasted thousands of dollars here.omari will claim that your music is expected to reach a certain threshold of plays as ""proof"" that their service is legitimate. however, based on my experiences with other playlist-pitching services, i can absolutely guarantee you that, if the playlists that my song was placed into were either organically grown and/or weren't bot-infested, i wouldn't have seen such a sudden drop-off in saves and a complete snapback in monthly listeners (back to exactly where i was before the promotion started) once the promotion ended. one thing i forgot to mention that put the nail in the coffin i spotted 2 playlists that had most of their followers erased. more specifically, ""hip hop music"" and ""chill music 2020."" both playlists had just under 100k followers when my singles were first placed into both playlists during both promotional periods. then, suddenly, both playlists only had around a few dozen followers. spotify frequently wipes out playlists that are spotted to host a mass amount of fake followers. as of writing this, it looks like both playlists are back up to a little over 1,000 followers, so it looks like edm hits (who owns both playlists) are trying to slowly artificially pump their numbers back up. these are just 2 examples; who knows how many other playlists that my songs were placed into also had their follower-count wiped out because of artificial inflation.also, although it wasn't necessarily a dealbreaker for me, some people might have a problem with their music being placed in playlists that don't match their genre or feeling of the song. the hip hop track that i had promoted with omari is dark and gritty (both production and lyricism), so to have it placed in ""chill music 2020"" had me scratching my head.source without disclosing too much of my personal life, i worked in marketing (more specifically, streaming marketing) at one of the major labels, so i know a thing-or-two about playlisting and how the numbers should look once a song is either removed from or shuffled around a network of (legitimate) playlists.-----update refunds are not issued to customers. omari gauges the success of campaigns solely based off of the quantity of (botted) streams. i was under the impression that omari’s campaign would’ve generated organic playlist traffic - if i wanted botted playlist traffic, i would’ve used a different company for much cheaper.  for those who don’t know (i’ve seen many 5-star reviews come in with people not knowing what they’re talking about after purchasing omari’s spotify campaign), the only way to differentiate organic versus inorganic traffic for playlist placements is not by quantity of streams, but by the health of the song once the track is removed from the playlist (analyzed through spotify’s backend metrics and manually tracking statistics pre-and-post placements). i’m extremely disappointed. good luck to those who still choose to opt in. you’ve been warned."

5fc3dfe05e693f08f00e0b29,4,"Omari keeps its promises, gets results","I’m an Americana songwriter from Kansas City and have written songs on and off since 1970. I got more serious around 2010 (when I started performing) and then in March of 2020, when the pandemic struck and I was laid off. It was then that I began to understand what being serious about a craft really means, and how much work can go into refining the melody, lyrics, singing and overall presentation.I’ve released four studio CDs since 2015 and have enough songs recorded in pre-produced form to fill almost two more.What I didn’t have was a way to promote my music outside of Kansas City. I read a blogger’s review/ranking of 10 promotional companies and both Omari and another outfit seemed suited to having my songs added to playlists, promoted on You Tube and eventually pushed to alternative, college and public radio stations.Omari promptly responded to my first and subsequent emails. The other service responded, but not quite as quickly. I chose Omari because of its range of services, responsiveness and its prices. I felt it fit my needs.My first promotion was for three songs at the Bronze level. I staggered the releases three weeks apart with the thought that first exposure could build An audience through the third and beyond.The songs (all from my “Just Us Chickens” CD) attracted more than 2,000 listeners and are still being played. One of the songs, “Everything I Know (I Learned from Loneliness)” had 1,500 streams and is still on playlists.I followed those with a Christmas single (“In the Arms of a Song”) I thought would do well. It was streamed 650 times in just 4 days and was over 1,700 the last time I checked. It was even picked up by a playlist devoted to music for movies — a nice surprise — that’s played it 600+ times!In retrospect, I was trying to time the release to coincide with the Christmas season. The song might’ve done even better had I waited to release it two or three weeks before Christmas day, rather than Nov.15.Omari has done what it said it would do — released my music promptly and used its network of playlist operators to have it played. My only criticism (why my rating is four stars, not five) is that the majority of the playlists adding my songs seemed similar and generic. I listened to some other songs on the lists and thought my brand of music might’ve done better on lists  that placed more emphasis on lyrics and originality, and targeted a more music-savvy, sophisticated audience.But I’m pleased overall and am planning a new Omari promotion of several songs from “Pigeon Toad,” a CD with a Dec. 7 release date. I haven’t decided yet which programs I’ll buy, but I may release songs at different levels (Bronze, Gold etc.) and stagger them toward a finale of the strongest song.Longterm I don’t expect commercial success.

The song might’ve done even better had I waited to release it two or three weeks before Christmas day, rather than Nov.15.Omari has done what it said it would do — released my music promptly and used its network of playlist operators to have it played. My only criticism (why my rating is four stars, not five) is that the majority of the playlists adding my songs seemed similar and generic. I listened to some other songs on the lists and thought my brand of music might’ve done better on lists  that placed more emphasis on lyrics and originality, and targeted a more music-savvy, sophisticated audience.But I’m pleased overall and am planning a new Omari promotion of several songs from “Pigeon Toad,” a CD with a Dec. 7 release date. I haven’t decided yet which programs I’ll buy, but I may release songs at different levels (Bronze, Gold etc.) and stagger them toward a finale of the strongest song.Longterm I don’t expect commercial success. But with Omari’s help I hope to have more  and more people enjoy my music.","i’m an americana songwriter from kansas city and have written songs on and off since 1970. i got more serious around 2010 (when i started performing) and then in march of 2020, when the pandemic struck and i was laid off. it was then that i began to understand what being serious about a craft really means, and how much work can go into refining the melody, lyrics, singing and overall presentation.i’ve released four studio cds since 2015 and have enough songs recorded in pre-produced form to fill almost two more.what i didn’t have was a way to promote my music outside of kansas city. i read a blogger’s review/ranking of 10 promotional companies and both omari and another outfit seemed suited to having my songs added to playlists, promoted on you tube and eventually pushed to alternative, college and public radio stations.omari promptly responded to my first and subsequent emails. the other service responded, but not quite as quickly. i chose omari because of its range of services, responsiveness and its prices. i felt it fit my needs.my first promotion was for three songs at the bronze level. i staggered the releases three weeks apart with the thought that first exposure could build an audience through the third and beyond.the songs (all from my “just us chickens” cd) attracted more than 2,000 listeners and are still being played. one of the songs, “everything i know (i learned from loneliness)” had 1,500 streams and is still on playlists.i followed those with a christmas single (“in the arms of a song”) i thought would do well. it was streamed 650 times in just 4 days and was over 1,700 the last time i checked. it was even picked up by a playlist devoted to music for movies — a nice surprise — that’s played it 600 times!in retrospect, i was trying to time the release to coincide with the christmas season. the song might’ve done even better had i waited to release it two or three weeks before christmas day, rather than nov.15.omari has done what it said it would do — released my music promptly and used its network of playlist operators to have it played. my only criticism (why my rating is four stars, not five) is that the majority of the playlists adding my songs seemed similar and generic. i listened to some other songs on the lists and thought my brand of music might’ve done better on lists  that placed more emphasis on lyrics and originality, and targeted a more music-savvy, sophisticated audience.but i’m pleased overall and am planning a new omari promotion of several songs from “pigeon toad,” a cd with a dec. 7 release date. i haven’t decided yet which programs i’ll buy, but i may release songs at different levels (bronze, gold etc.) and stagger them toward a finale of the strongest song.longterm i don’t expect commercial success. but with omari’s help i hope to have more  and more people enjoy my music."

But to end up on a playlist of Spotify or Youtube is almost impossible. With some skepticism I entered the adventure with Omari. Can you get real exposure for a modest amount of money? Yes, that turned out to be possible! You shouldn't expect miracles, but from the first time I submitted a song to Omari I got real listeners in return.

In the email was a quick review of my song which they told me that the song sounded good and of quality. I was immediately excited. Even gave me a site to track my songs on playlist, which the site tracks the song a week or two faster than Spotify which was awesome. They did everything they were suppose to do, I was able to track what they told me they were going to do and that was awesome! Definitely going to use the services again and try other services that you have! I just want to say thank you for everything.

Today is August 16. I gave Omari MC's service a month before reviewing, because I know these things take time. Here's my experience:I sent them three songs on July 16. I immediately got an email back that said ""Thanks for sending! The songs were well done overall. Good production, engineering, and delivery."", as well as a link to a PDF document explaining the music business. I later realized this wasn't really an evaluation of my music, but was just an auto-response, because it was in every email they sent me from that point forward. On July 20th, a few days after they said all was good, they emailed again stating they could not add one of the songs because it contained the word ""damn"". Which is fine, their decision, but I asked for either a refund or a replacement song. I sent multiple emails, and got no reply. Finally, I contacted them via Facebook. They apologized and said they were ""very backed up"" and would be emailing me about adding the 3rd song soon, despite me paying $17 extra to get service ""within one business day"", and this was almost 10 business days later at this point with no results. This is my main complaint: their customer support and communication was generally not good -- many days between responses, very terse responses, and a few emails didn't even get replies. The 3rd song was finally added, according to them, almost 2 weeks after my submission, and I only saw an increase in plays this week. The 3rd song still hasn't received the minimum 25 plays to be listed on Spotify's Artist app, so I have no idea if it's actually been added to any playlist, or what playlist it was added to. As for the results, I paid $77 per song plus a $17 ""within one business day"", for a total of $248. In 28 days, the first song received 408 plays, the second 279, and the third 51. The rest of the songs on my album had an average of about 50 plays in the same time frame, and I'm not sure how much traffic was from them or from traffic I was already generating, so I think it would be fair to deduct about 50 plays from those numbers, as I was hitting those kind of numbers prior to signing up for their service.Was their service worth 33 cents per play?

In the beginning also Understand I was a bit unknowledgeable of how their service works until I started to see results that showed me what was the purpose of ongoing promotion to build up a following. So people get to know who you are and what you’re about and what you are putting out to the world trying to find an honest promotion company that gives you legit outcome is hard I did my homework searching and finding companies that were showing honest feedback not only from them but customers. Like any promotions I noticed that you have to understand that Rome wasn’t built in a day it will take time and diligence and it also has to do with the work that you present to them you can’t expect them to work wonders with something that is mediocre. But if you give them something that is phenomenal and some thing that will make it even easier for them to do what they known for and do best than you will be in the ballpark. With them and you were score a homerun every time. So for anyone that is looking to use them for their promotions understand that it’s a partnership. Don’t expect things to just Blow up right away. For you with just one promotion that You purchase if you don’t have a huge following already where people will spread the word and let them know who you are it took time for me to get to where I am now. And believe me so it will be the same for you also. If you give them something that is fire in their eyes they will work to make it an inferno for you but before that happens it Hass to be fire not just a little spark.

Working with OMARI made things as easy as 1-2-3! I Am Somebody-Remix by Denise Foster is my first recorded solo single.

Thanks to the exposure provided by the OMARI Spotify campaign,  I have found an avenue to fulfill my purpose/calling to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Whether you are learning as you go like I am or you are already an established artist, OMARI has the wisdom and tools to take you as far as you choose to go.

5f11c7813f06f20614333a9f,5,Omari MC,"Omari MC, is the best promotion site I have found out there.

I found Omari listed with 20 other sites so I tried a song with several of them at the same time but different songs, When I checked my Spotify and YouTube personal account analytics, I could  click directly to the playlist my songs were on from omari. The other 3 just had high numbers of plays but you had to log into a site to see the playlist you were on and some did not have that.  With Omari you don't need to use it to see the playlist they put you in if you have Spotify or iTunes analytics, although Omari provides you a link too see as well.Some of the sites were cheaper and some were the same price but I could not trace my plays on them.I have spent hundreds of dollars trying to find a ligament organic promotions site that has a reasonable price before I found them.

5e8e82ee086b64095432f27f,1,Extremely low audience retention (2% at 2 minutes via ad vs 30% organic),"Don't waste money on a service that is not going to help you build a legitimate fanbase. The YouTube ads are ineffective at finding you people who are going to be interested in your content, they just do discovery ads so that it counts all the views from people who will not actually watch your video. At 2 minutes into the video my retention rate from the ad was a dismal 2%, bringing my overall retention way down from about 30% from the organic views. I emailed Omari's team halfway through the ad asking if they could change the age targeting because its audience was out of my demographic. The audience was 87% ages 25-65+ and my target demographic is 13-25. I did not recieve a reply. I called after a few days of terrible audience retention and asked for the ad to be pulled so it wouldn't bring my stats down further. Omari gave me a BS response about how it's because it's not an in play ad and the view counts are counting all views whereas in play counts only if they get to 30 seconds at least, and that at 2 minutes an in play ad would have 6% retention. Ok well still way more than 2% retention on my discovery ad. Its not because it's a bad video either. A preview of the vid is getting me about 50c a follower on instagram in expensive areas primarily california. So the age targeting and most likely the rest of the targeting is just nothing close to the ""highly targeted YouTube ads to have maximum engagement because we have thousands of dollars of experience"" that was advertised to me. These people don't know your fanbase better than you do and at any rate you are not going to benefit from enhanced targeting from these ads vs running them yourself or finding an ads manager that will listen to your input and feedback. Omari's company will disregard your feedback, I brought up the age issue twice and zero response. Super unprofessional of them and a waste of money. They also would not elaborate on how my ad was being presented because I still have no idea. Glad I ran this as a test ad because I was considering buying much bigger packages if the service worked.
