643dfe9d05faeda7356c6092,5,The First & Best Move for any Indy Artist Begins Here,"Firstly, I don't normally write reviews.Secondly, I'm a skeptic at heart, and not normally or easily impressed.  There are many, many DIY programs designed for independent artists these days.  But, in Ryan, you have not only found a tech/ marketing genius, you have not only found a fellow artist.. you have found an articulate, empathetic young man whose true calling in life is teaching, nurturing, and supporting fellow artists and like-minded souls.  Many online programs will tell you how many ""thousands of dollars"" can be made as an indy artist. But, Ryan has created a college-level course which actually walks you through the process step by step. You will not only learn basic marketing skills, you will not only learn how to navigate the Meta Facebook universe, but, you will also learn the very same marketing & business techniques used by record companies today to promote their artists. Ryan gives you the tools you need to be successful in today's market.  And he has also created a community of knowledgeable, artistic souls who are eager to help and offer guidance.I strongly urge every indy artist to sign up for this program.  Again.. I do not work for Ryan, and he is not paying me to say this. But, I'm gonna say this:  ""If you are an indy artist and do not take this course, you are not giving yourself a real chance for success in this lifetime.""
