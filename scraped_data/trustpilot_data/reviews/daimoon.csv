648ae109c53234132078b5ed,5,Daimoon Media's Spotify Bedroom Artist Plan is Awesome if you have a small Campaign Budget.,"The first campaign I ran with Daimoon Media was for my song To Be Rescued by Just Suddenly. It had 68 plays at the time. And within a month or two, the song has achieved 2500 plays and continues to grow every day. I have run 3 more song campaigns with Daimoon since then. I opted for the Bedroom Artist plan because it suits my budget the best. But I'm sure their bigger campaign plans are just as effective as the starter pack. The Campaign Supervisors are extremely friendly, very receptive, and provide timely replies. I've been analyzing and observing the playlists and streams for 4 months now and the results are consistent and bot free. When I ran my first campaign with Daimoon the only concern I had was, is it a scam, and will it help my artist profile grow organically once I stop the campaign. And I'm happy and relieved that Daimoon passed my expectation with flying colors. Being added to good playlists does trigger Spotify's Organic Algorithm and Spotify begins promoting your song through its Radio Feed. It's an extremely slow process though, but it's a good start. I love Daimoon Media and I am going to continue running every song's campaign with them. And you should totally try their services and use their playlist network to grow your audiences. I'm not saying Daimoon Media can do the impossible, they have limitations too. They weren't able to place some of my songs cause the curators did not feel the songs matched their playlists' vibe. But they tried their best and were transparent with the results. I will run out of words if I have to jot down all the Pros of running a campaign with Daimoon Media. And even if there are some Cons, there always are in a real-world scenario, the Pros outweigh the Cons by a huge margin. So, I'm going to totally recommend Daimoon Media's Spotify Campaign to every band/musician out there. And I am extremely happy with their pricing, services, and results. I hope you try them out at least once and see for yourself.

64169adceb400188680f9174,2,authentic playlisting??,"So, I’m usually hesitant on Spotify playlisting (for good reason), but one of my music affiliates mentioned this site to me and how it helped them get more traction. I ended up trying it out and saw a good initial boost with the first playlist add so i ended up investing more. Now, my first red flag was after I saw one of my songs removed from a playlist. i’ve never seen one of my releases drop plays that significantly right after removal from that big of a playlist. that was my first indicator of bot/farmed streams. since i had already payed for multiple of my other songs, i observed carefully. 3 of my songs were put in the same playlist, 2 of them were added at the same time. as i checked on the streams for those two (multiple days apart) i noticed they were getting the exact same amount of plays from that playlist (red flag #2). i thought maybe i was trippin so i decided to check a few days after. again, same exact amount of plays for those two songs. so, it showed me that they have bots or hired people that leave the playlist on replay, which leads to no outside growth.conclusion, will they you get more plays? yeswill they you get more fans? no",2023-03-19T07:17:16.000Z,"March 09, 2023",soljay,1,US,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/64169adceb400188680f9174,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/64169aaf8d9a7d001371f340

To be honest I don't know exactly what those curators are looking for. I'm sure the song is not a masterpiece but it's definitely not a bad song as it's doing quite well on Spotify. During this period Dennis always kept me posted about what was going on and offered me a few options to solve the problem.

This is a plus.But they also failed to pitch two songs of mine and that can't be the quality or the style or genre because I can tell via my Spotify artist account that the songs *were not listened to at all*, outside of the usual suspects; no 'curator' even took the time to listen. This begs the question what the process of this pitching actually entails.Fair to say, Daimoon did refund me after acknowledging the failure, so props for that. [...] . Our music may be niche but our very real audience on Soundcloud knows what to like, and as that is already over 1k of real (musically minded) people, this means that there must be hundreds of thousands if not millions of potential listeners out there, [...] it should certainly be possible to connect the music to the audience in some way.Fair enough, that probably is the trickiest bit of the entire music business anyway, especially on a budget...

61e332c4e1196e51d76507d8,1,Fooled again,"I ran a completely separate second campaign with Daimoon Media after being contacted by their associate Luka. He attempted to win my business back by offering all kinds of things so when I decided to give them another shot I clarified quite a few of my original concerns. Luka assured me that they could easily reach the follower goal that I paid for and that the songs would be placed on relevant playlists within the agreed upon timeframe. My song was placed on 2 relevant playlists, still falling short of the follower goal. Then the day our agreed upon timeframe ended, before reaching the follower goal, the two playlists I was on immediately removed my song and totally changed their playlists to something completely opposite of the genre my music was featured on before. When I demanded a refund because what was promised was not delivered, Luka refused until I threatened to contest the charge with my bank. He continued to give a sob story about the company using their assets, resources, etc so I shouldn't be owed a refund.This company clearly is out to make money from artists whether they deliver their promised results or not. I made a mistake in running a second campaign with them and if I were you I would steer clear of this company.EDIT (Response to review comment):First I'd like to address the comment about me not leaving room for conversation. I communicated with the representative from this company for weeks sending numerous emails, we had plenty of conversation before and during the campaign. I was guaranteed that this campaign would reach the promised follower count. It did not. Second this company claims that I gained over 10,000 streams from their smaller playlists. This isn't true in any stretch of the imagination and there would be no way for this company to even remotely guess on the amount of streams I gained as they don't have access to my S4A stats. This is a blatant lie by this company. Third, I did demand a refund because the promised reach was not met. When asking for a refund on my previous campaign I was told I wouldn't be given one because the agreed upon follower count was reached. So when on this campaign it was not reached I expected a refund as that is what I was told was the issue in the previous campaign. Now, just as I stated earlier, this company wants to take money from artists whether or not they do what they agreed to do. Again I would recommend never working with this company as they are clearly comfortable lying on their review responses and want to keep your money whether they do what they say they will do or not.",2022-03-08T20:41:12.000Z,"January 15, 2022",Michael Goodrick,8,US,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/61e332c4e1196e51d76507d8,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/609d3b884860e80019d11875
