64c14a3d49be670941475df9,1,A criminal enterprise!  Seriously.,"Make no mistake.  This is a SCAM!  And though they will reply to this negative review as they do to the scores of others by claiming that they do not use bots, be assured that there are no actual people listening to your music.  None.  I canceled after the first day when I checked my Spotify analytics to see that I had 31 streams from 31 different people all living in a town in Virginia with a population of 40K.  And all streams came, not from playlists, but from my artist profile.  If it's not bots, then it's some guy in Virginia with 31 different Spotify accounts clicking on my song 31 times and letting it play for the required 30 seconds.  I have requested a refund both by email and through the WhatsApp number they provide and have not heard back from them.  Rest assured, if my account is not credited in full in the next 48 hours, I will get the police involved and perhaps look into organizing a class action lawsuit for all the people who have been similarly scammed by these people.  And please take note of the fact that the myriad one-star reviews are, for the most part, all written in proper English and contain specific details, whereas the five star reviews are vague, overly laudatory, and mostly written in broken English.Update:  Adding this because it's hilarious.  I have an older song on Spotify that I've never promoted.  Recently my analytics showed that the song had zero streams in the last 28 days and, thanks to Musicverscamming, 40 saves!  That's right, forty people, without even listening to the song, decided they liked it enough to add it to their music libraries.

64b039ea371b68b591ebb70d,1,Zero stars,"Zero stars. 10k streams across multiple tracks per month and ZERO followers. That's not just improbable, it's statistically impossible. Even a 10% follow rate is terrible and generally speaks more to your copy and targeting than your music. After numerous conversations with them, I finally got them to admit they use programmatic native advertising. Ever scroll way past an article you were reading to click on one of the endless ads that follows? Didn't think so. How about the sponsored ads at the top of search result? Also no? These are where their tens of thousands of streams apparently come from overnight. It has to be bots, there's no other way. I don't doubt that they might use their terrible advertising techniques legitimately... but it's 100% bots clicking on those ads. They just pretend to have no knowledge of that part.The best part is that they talk to you like you're an idiot, because that's who they think their customers are. They claim their ads target people's browsing behavior etc... no kidding, that's literally what any ad does lol. Anyone ever run an ad targeted to no one? It doesn't change the fact that they're using among the worst possible advertising method that not only doesn't produce meaningful results, but harms your brand as well. They will completely destroy your algorithmic progress at best, and get you banned at worst. Still worth $40/mo? Maybe if you're as stupid as they hope you are.To top it all off, the positive reviews here are just as fake and meaningless. Hownwas it a good experience?

I n the beginning I was suddenly on ""playlists""! And just after a short time of two weeks ""hundereds of ""real"" listeners had  ""saved my song"", and i was ""listened to"" by thousands. I was so glad. 5000 "" organic Streams"" was reported under the month, 460 persons had ""saved "" my music to their Spotify. This was listeners that was ""gained"" during the time I paid. This was listeners that I would keep. But,  NOT ONE SINGLE!!! of those ""listeners"" wanted to have me when I wanted to try what happened when  I did nt want to pay anymore. Then Musikvertising erased all of my monthly listeners. But why didn't I continue then, to pay to continue with high listening shares. Well, because there was something strange about the fact that even though I had ""hundreds of new listeners every day"" it never produced any results when I was logged in. Day and night showed "" 0 listeners right now"", but when the report was a fact 400 listeners more, than the day before.I was looking every time i was checking in every waken hour on Spotify, despite the ""0 streams right now"" I got the answer from Musicvertising that it has to be something wrong with this parameter on Spotify. Afterwars I can understand it was not real listerners.it was boths:even if that kind of bots is forbidden in EU in this context.But why didn't I continue then, to pay to continue with high listening shares. Well, because there was something strange about the fact that even though I had ""hundreds of new listeners every day"" it never produced any results when I In hindsight, of course, I realized it was just fake.It is hard to imagine that Musicvertisment can go into every data user and change the parameter to not follow.The streams are so coordinated.Therefore, I rule out that it is not about real listeners. Exactly on the date that I stop paying, the audience numbers start to drop. I am no longer on any ""playlists"". Today I have Musicvertisment  to thank for making me feel like a hopelessly failed artist. I was fooled into thinking that this was a viable way to spread my music more widely. Alas, as I deceived myself.But your old feeds are destroyed as you are brutally removed from playlists that you paid Musicvertisment, and I went from around 50 followers that I had worked up to a year, to only one - myself, when Musicvertisment manipulated the feeds so that my page is recognized as an error page. I probably have to take down my page on to be able to get followers again. Make new releases. It is no easy ways to followers like Muscvertisment states. This is my final judgment of Musicvertisments services.  I l never give them one cent more, according to the damage they have made for me. I would have had my 40-50  per month now, that I had before Musicvertisment  removed me from the playlists I paid myself into. What you are doing must be in the greyzone of the jusicearea.

But then you check your royalties for the months you thought you had lots of streams and then see, it's not adding up. Surprise. It's bots. Congratulations. You got scammed like me 🤡 also the followers dissapear. And its obvious that they use bots when 1000 followers dissapear in two days. Nothing organic in this scam. It's obvious. They pay bots to just follow you as long your campaign is running and for clicking on your song, no real person is listening. You can also risk getting banned from Spotify.

6423e7efe7fa393361ce30a6,5,Delivered the Spotify Streams and Followers,"I have been using this service for about 5+ weeks now. They have over delivered on their promise in terms of Spotify Streams and Followers. So that is a great result. Thank you! (and don't stop now, please keep going :)Towards the end of the first month I did have some concerns about whether they were all real people listening and following - it seemed too good to be true. I contacted their customer care team with my concerns, and I can say that they have excellent customer care in terms of people and processes. They assured me that they use targeted advertising campaigns to generate organic growth from real people and that they do not use bots or fake accounts. I have seen some anomalies in the data. You see days with big stream peaks which are the days that they do their promotions/advertising. But I can also see genuine organic streams on the days in between that have been growing from week to week. I am also getting more and more streams from playlists - both the Spotify generated playlists and the ones that they have placed for me. So it is working.Also there have been some days where I have got more followers than streams. Which I found puzzling. But thinking about my own promotion. I have run ads on Facebook to get FB likes or email subscribers on my site. And have sometimes got hundreds or thousands of these, without corresponding spikes in plays/streams. So maybe this can happen on Spotify too, depending on the call to action of the marketing ad/campaign.Anyway we all want real people listening and hopefully becoming fans and super fans. Seems to be going pretty well so far.",2023-03-29T09:25:35.000Z,"March 29, 2023",Blake,2,AU,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6423e7efe7fa393361ce30a6,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/6423e7bcd814e30013af22a7

64156ec2b23ed3073a5f4375,1,"Stay away from Musicvertising, they do not provide the service they promise.","My experience with Musicvertisin is very negative. We subscribed for the Spotify channel promotion twice. Yes, I am ashamed that I let them fool me twice.Firstly, we subscribed for the ""Business Campaign"" in November 2022. We were receiving the promised promotion for a month, even if it looked strange, not balanced, with 30 streams per listener, big peaks followed by silence. It almost went to a standstill for a week before the renewal date but became very active the day before. Once we renewed, the service almost stopped, and we had weeks without any promotion. Each time I complained, I had lots of promises but no action. So I cancelled, but I received a lot of messages and promises, one of them stating that there was a bug in my promotion, and it was fixed, and they will compensate me. I signed again, this time for the Diamond channel promotion, the most expensive - $1,999 per month. I was promised stable, consistent promotion in writing. It went to a standstill at the end of the month again, but just three days before renewal it picked up. And completely stopped for a week after.Again, during the second month, I had three weeks without a promotion. The listeners dropped by 74%, and the streams dropped by %47. The followers also dropped, but I think those FOLLOWER S ARE TOTALLY FAKE - they never picked out our new releases. The Spotify algorithmic streams dropped to the level before promotion. Now PLAYLISTS: During four months of promotion, we were given FOUR placements in the playlist. During the same time, I secured over 50 placements on SubmitHub... However, Musicvertising playlists are FAKE - they have lots of followers etc, but they are not played. I did not see any plays from Musicverising playlists.SO THE CONCLUSION: perhaps MusicVertising is not using bots, perhaps they are legit, and perhaps they are not scammers. It is difficult to prove. But for sure, they just do not have the capacity to provide the service they promise.

63ecbedb9b64b1bdaf580b22,1,Bot scam! Do not waste your time!,"Musicvertising is totally a bot scam!I signed up in December to their starter package for Spotify. Within 24 hours, I saw a drastic shift in the number of streams and followers. I was excited. Over the next 5/6 days, the stats flatlined and there was no change. I didn't think it was odd because I was still excited about that first day. A week later again, there was another growth spurt in my streams and my followers in one day, and then another few days of nothing. When I asked why I wasn't seeing more of a steady increase throughout the week, which is what I would expect from an on-going campaign, I was told that the growth is a result of the campaign being placed on successful platforms. I asked why then wouldn't they just place the campaign on those specific platforms where they have seen the best results. All of a sudden the consultant was very unhelpful and I didn't get a proper answer except to say they target people who are likely to respond positively to the music.A week later on more of less the same day, there was another growth spurt. And I started noticing that it went up by more or less the same amount of listeners each week, which is all hogwash. I could literally predict what my listenership was going to be in each week and on which day. *Their response below is an example of what I mean. Total bull. Even on days when a campaign is not as effective you can expect at least 1 or 2 listeners to follow you. But to have nothing for a whole week and then a sudden upsurge every week on Thursday is nothing less than suspicious.*Then I cancelled my subscription a month later. Within a week, by number of followers started dipping. It's been about 3 weeks, and now I am literally right back to the same number of listeners I had before I paid for the service. When I enquired about it, they first blamed Spotify, and then said sometimes followers decide to unfollow an artist. Problem with this explanation is if you track the stats, I have lost followers in batches each week more of less on the same day... The same way I gained them. That explanation would probably make sense if over time I started seeing a steady decline... **Edited after their response below: What Musicvertising have not accounted for is that some of us actially have friends and family working for companies like Spotify and Youtube. In my case, I'm fortunate to actually have both... Musicvertising uses bots to get artists streaming and follower numbers up. There is nothinf organic about it. This is a problem for Spotify because when they recon their accounts, they number stream do not align with the actual activity on the system.Musicvertising has crafted the perfect template response which is just vague enough to soind convincing without actually saying anything.**Now I'm worried that they've potentially messed up my Spotify algorithm for real organic growth.***This is a completely malicious company that is preying on the passion and desperstion of so many hopeful upcoming musicians, damaging their careers sometimes irreversably.They claim that tbeir customer service is available to assist, however, I've been through theie customer service.

It's mainly because they're not open until tomorrow so hopefully they fix the problem with my streams but if not, I'm gonna switch pr companies, Now don't get me wrong, the results are not fake, They're 100℅ legit believe it or not because if it was all bot streams, the other section of your source of streams would be all the way up. I'm cool with their service because it's legit but I'm getting skeptical about it since I lost streams and followers. Hopefully they fix the issue but if not, I'm switching to major marketing academy or playlist push.Second update: after complaining about the decrease in streams and stating I will switch companies if nothing was done, I started to see results again.

63406660b67840c2ab2b2777,1,"""Warning warning Will Robinson"".  Look elsewhere!","Not sure who truly wrote the highly-rated reviews, perhaps they are real. Based on my experience with this firm,  I tend to doubt it.  My Spotify followers gained attraction during the trial period, then dramatically dropped off.  With numbers declining, they continued to charge my credit card.  I really don't check social media often as I do pretty okay just doing what I do. Glad that I had checked. When I contacted them for a refund, they stated that Spotify was having numbers issues. That is not my problem.  Further, despite what their Google search response states about 100% guaranteed,  they did not want to provide a refund. After a lot of back and forth, they agreed to a partial refund.  It is not the client's issue if a third party has technical issues as they had indicated and prevents them from providing the service that they advertise. Should they have provided a complete refund, then I would have published my experience but still provided a good rating based on their integrity as a busines.  Again, the initial results were positive and the right thing to do would have been to provide a complete refund for the time period ( most of my time with them) that the numbers significantly dropped off.  So, I was paying this company for decreasing Spotify numbers.  Isn't that just terrific? There are other firms out there that are much more reliable. I would continue to look and not provide your hard-earned income to this company regardless of how attractive they make it look. The one star is because the initial results during the trial period were indeed impressive.  Then.. Oh boy!

62738916f03a9893e98435b3,2,What actually happens during the advertisement campaign,"So, to give credit where credit’s due, the number of streams of my music has grown, though by a small margin. Hovewer, it seems that this company uses some loopholes in Spotify TOS and then just tell you that they “fully comply” with them. I will just tell you what I can based on closely watching my Spotify artist stats during the campaign.1. Streams come and go in “waves”. E.g. today you have 100 streams on your music, tomorrow - 1000, a day after that - 500 and three days later 100 streams again. That’s a pattern that was being repeated over and over during one month of the advertisement campaign. 2. A majority of streams was being made using an unknown type of device. Spotify stats differentiate if people were listening to your music using their smartphone, PC, gaming console, e.t.c. Before the campaign those stats for my music were distributed pretty naturally, with 70-80% listening on their smartphones. However, after the campaign started, nearly 50-60% of streams came from the device type “Other”, which is a huge red flag in my opinion.3. Spotify stats also differentiate between streams that were made from your artist page , user’s own playlists, editorial playlists and algorithmic playlists. During the campaign the percentage was thus: 60% from the artist page, nearly 30% from user’s own playlist and around 10% from other people playlists. To ensure those 30+10% this company makes a clever little thing: the streams are EVENLY distributed between the user playlists that already contain a song in question and a playlist that contains ONLY the track in question with the same name as the track is created (there were such playlists for EVERY single track in my album) and a lot of streams come from this playlist too, which is suspicious to say the least.4. Followers. New followers appear in a pattern that looks like a staircase on a graph.  Every X days, almost the same amount of followers are subscribing to you, which is extremely reminiscent of youtube bot raids. Another funny detail - in the previous reviews the company representative answered that follower drop (that happened to me in the end of april) has happened because Spotify are deleting inactive accounts. But, at least in my case, if i put a ruler onto the followers graph (i am not smart enough to do actual maths) before the advertisement campaign it looked like an even uphill line, which is natural. Then, there is the aforementioned “staircase”, a plateau, a huge follower drop, and then the graph continues naturally in an uphill fashion. The funny thing is, if i put a ruler to the beginning of a follower graph (which is a date when i made a first release and promoted it on my youtube channel) and connect it with today’s date, those couple weeks after the campaign ended look like a natural continuation of a slightly-uphill graph before the campaign, and the follower drop actually had “stabilized” it to that level. If what I am trying to say is too cryptic and complicated - it looks like those followers that are allegedly not bots and that have followed me during the campaign ALL were deleted from my account and in the end they had no impact on the graph angle and trend whatsoever. So, they may not be bots, but they may be free accounts registered en masse by this company for use in their services (it’s the best case, the worst is those are hacked accounts).So, this company may not be LITERALLY using bots, but nobody defines what is “a bot” in this case. Also, they may comply with Spotify TOS (at least for now) but likely are using loopholes in it. They use semantic and legal loopholes in order to make it look like the services they provide are legit:2 stars and not 1 because I have a little more streams now.",2022-05-05T10:21:42.000Z,"May 05, 2022",John Mandrake,1,UA,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/62738916f03a9893e98435b3,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/627388d67773da0012f682f2
