I know they have a shockingly bad reputation, but someone I know recommended the Ditto Promo package and I thought i'd try something different. They have basically taken £399 and provided no service at all. They sent me a copy and pasted ""social media plan"" and then two graphics which were just my own artwork with some cheap looking writing over the top. They requested access to my meta business account to run an instagram ad campaign which never happened. They also promise some press coverage which also has not happened. My release has been out for two weeks and I have heard nothing from them. They have now decided to ignore me and all communication has ceased. I have requested a cancellation and a refund as they are two weeks late on delivering the product that I paid for. They also told me that I could not use the artwork that I wanted to which has never happened with another distributer.  Don't risk it, its a scam!

65e4e25b20eaf756e52eedea,1,Don't believe any of the positive reviews!,"I have been using DITTO for a few years now and they were great in the beginning, but they have got dramatically worse and worse over time. I think that all these positive reviews about great customer service and in 5 stars reviews in general are all fake or written by them, they have to be because their customer service is the WORST. They pick and choose which issues to respond to. I have had them respond to small issues within minutes (seriously, I was shocked too) and then other major issues like a problem with an upcoming release, no response for over two weeks. You can see in the chat (they have a live chat, but you can never chat with anyone live, lol, go figure) that the person is online or was but never reads your message. They must have a feature where it shows they never did, but I assume they see it. Anyways, customer service may be least of your worries. They previously had a good system with getting your royalties out whenever you had funds to withdraw, direct deposit into your bank acct. Now, they have recently changed it to using Payoneer, which they have had options to use in the past, now their system isn't working. They tell you it is Payoneer's fault and you must resolve with them. Once you resolve your issues with them and you think you will be okay, you still have issues and you can't withdraw your royalties they are now on lockdown for whatever reasons. Also, for all you guys out there youtube reviews of DITTO, there are many other artists saying Ditto is holding funds from them or not paying 100% which they claim, I assume there are plenty of hidden fees in the small fine print you sign when you sign up. Of course, I have tried to communicate with Ditto about getting my royalties and why I don't have the option to withdraw my funds, but yet again they have ignored me and its been two weeks as of today. It has to be a problem with them, if I fixed everything with Payonner, and Payoneer gave me a confirmation that I can now withdraw funds with Ditto, but Ditto has a message saying it is still processing. As you become one of the many artists in their pool you will become like all of us ignored and not cared for. There are other issues I can go on and on, but these are the main ones as of recent they have led me to write a negative review. Believe me, I did not want to sit down and write this, but I have had it. And I want to make sure you don't get screwed too and stuck in in this and regret it later. So just beware before you sign up with this disgraceful company that claims to support independent artists. Do your research and watch real reviews from real people on YouTube, I wish I did before signing up.

65d6b6786408c843ed6b94e6,1,Ditto Steal Royalties ,"WARNING - WARNIG!! To the reply below !! Those breakdown figures Ditto gave were false. As I said I did not do promotion on over the 6 months it was only over 2 . Your team quoted over 1 million fake streams over the 6 months period  - impossible.Ditto took my Royalties Back in April of 2023 for $800 on 240k plus Spotify streams, my first Royalty payment was £25.00 Bank Transfer on April 28, 2023 Paid. I paid a professional company $1500 & then another $500 AUD to promote 2 songs from late 2022. I have retained Bank Records as evidence. I sent dozens of emails to the Ditto CS who accused me of Fake streams. Going by the remark below this appears now standard procedure for Ditto who have obviously lowered their standards by Ripping of small Artists. I have all evidence to suggest that Ditto had stolen my first Royalties back then as I use a Spotify Ads promotion company Geek Marketing to generate streams of 240 k I witnessed land on my Artist page. After Investigations i noticed that they never made in back into the Ditto back office so Ditto are manipulating the software to remove Artist streams, I also never used any promotions on the alleged streaming months they say i had 1 Million false streams over 6 months November of 2022 - April of 2023 this is impossible as i have Bank Records of the months i paid the marketing firm for the promotions. Also I never received any [ Official Spotify Takedown ] Notice from Ditto that are supposed to be sent to you via your Distributor. Ditto can say anything its just hear say.Also if this Allegation was true Ditto would had of removed alleged Tracks from their servers however No Actions were taken to remove me from their platform during this time.Im owed about $850 USD Dollars for back streaming. I have now made a Report to the Better Business Bureau along with other Artists.

I then scheduled promo stuff (features in local papers, stuff like that, national radio play) for the week following its  release. After a few days of the song being out I tried to cancel my sub with Ditto as they were looking money to extract royalties, so being a small artist that wasn't overly important to me. However one of their employees decides to cancel the sub and pull my tracks off all platforms. So when radio presenters or newspapers guide readers and listeners to my music there is nothing there. Ditto admitted that it was just an employee mistake but they've have been very relaxed and slow in replying and remedying the situation.  The tracks are still down five days later. Highly frustrating after putting so much in to the track. Just a warning to other artists using the site to be careful and very specific to avoid situations like this.

Slow response with no useful information. Or they close off tickets and ask for a review on how an agent did without even getting any info from them. Recently had royalties held because of some claim of fraudulent streams. We have zero control on who creates playlists of music online and we had not bought into a service that offers this. As they possibly suggest. We're a small DIY punk band, that just wanted to share music and earn what we can from the little you get from streaming. Which then goes back into subscription for the streaming services distribution.

In the message it said I could 'repair' the release but I can't.

All this because you are not able to insert an ""edit release"" section. No, you didn't solve the yt music problem, my new distributor (distrokid) allowed me to do it independently and when you replied you said ""it seems that the problem has already been solved"". The bank issue is inconceivable: I can't cancel subscriptions from my bank's app, nor can they (I contacted them and asked) so you should have included the option to remove the payment method from your site. Regarding your ""being happy to make changes that the stores allow to be made"", no, because I have always and only asked to insert titles in lower case and I was denied by you saying ""Apple Music doesn't allow it"" and now I have with my new distributor lowercase track names without problems. And yes, the price of the plan changed from 30 to 60 euros per year without me knowing before purchasing (I wouldn't have done it otherwise).I repeat, rather than justifying yourself, you should just apologize and make improvements... especially to those people who have not had the opportunity to earn their royalties because they were blocked by you (I read the other reviews). I'm sorry but when I'm made fun of I don't get over it.REVIEW:This is my last message sent to them:*Ditto, don't respond to this review with a useless justification as you always have, rather apologize for at least once*Il messaggio:Do you know that due to the poor service you offer I have had to contact digital stores, YouTube, my bank and your customer service every day because you are not able to offer a service that is at least ""user friendly"" for your customers? I have also been denied the opportunity to receive a refund for a service I did not receive... even now I have had to contact the bank because you are unable to cancel an automatic subscription to your flawed service. I wrote to your assistance every day for every little thing which was annoying for me and for you. Stop promising a service that you offer with thousands of problems a day, just insert a section where each user can independently modify their releases and you would have much less work to do. It's embarrassing to think that after the first subscription, the next one costs 60 euros a year without this being explicitly said somewhere when you decide to sign up. I know it's not your fault and that you're just working for a customer service that is always ready to assist, and at least I'm grateful for this because otherwise it would have been truly impossible to solve any problem.

65b63657944443db0bc949dc,4,For the most part,"For the most part, I've used several distributors in the past and was very underwhelmed with their ""sales pitchy"" ads, articles, advice, and, most of all, form responses to everything I asked or said when talking directly. It felt like a bad upsell dream I couldn't wake up from. The last distributor I had, made me reevaluate my choices with music releases because an overzealous fan thought they were helping a song I released by ""boosting it"" somehow, and it got my whole account canceled for a service violation I didn't create! The email I received after the fact from the distribution service (Songtradr) had no warnings, no one reached out to discuss an issue, no nothing. I just woke up one day to check the status of my account, and they cut my account! I didn't know the person and didn't know any of the particulars other than I was accused of using bots or something. Needless to say, I started paying attention to the backstory of the next distributor I would select. Ditto rings all the right bells with me. After five distributors and many issues along the way, I finally feel a relaxed disposition, an easy-to-use platform that anyone can operate, and a non-pushy approach to live help and interactions is the best I could hope for. The Ditto music service has allowed me to release three tracks flawlessly. Splits are easy, promotions, and the few times I spoke with a rep, the whole experience was great.

658afaa6e7288675af1d940a,2,Its been hard,I have been using a paid ditto plan since august 2023. It has its good and its bads. The bad is how hard it is to get emails from ditto. I never get any form of emails. Even when i paid for a plan i dint get an email. One of my recent releases got rejected and i wasnt notified in any way. This is not the first time either is happened. You are supposed to mail your customers when events happen on their accounts.One of my releases had a takedown request i didn't send but I wasn't notified. I have tried to change my password multiple times and yet i have not receive the email i am supposed to receiver to change it. Its quite a horrible experience to be honest.I had to message the Instagram account just so my release could be sent to stores atleast 2 weeks before release and I found out Ditto only sends in the release to the store 10 days or so to the release date no matter how early you submit it which makes me wonder if they are aware that artists need 2-3 weeks to pitch their music to Spotify. Although my release was sent in early after i complained. It was just an abnormal and unnecessary policy to have knowing fully well that a lot of artist like their songs being sent to stores at least 2-3 weeks prior to the release. Anyways i do like a few ditto features like being able to have multiple primary artists and have add as much credits and contributors you wish to your songs,2023-12-26T18:09:11.000Z,"December 26, 2023",Ezra,1,NG,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/658afaa6e7288675af1d940a,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/658afa8bc8c4570012f74c75

They are easily the single worst company (in any field) I have ever had to deal with. Trying to run a label with them as my distribution has been a sheer hell I wouldn't wish on anyone. Idiotic mistakes like spontaneously cancelling my account when I was fully paid up for another 6 months is just one example but, believe me, I could go on forever. The worst thing of all was this nonsense that you can't have text in the release design (other than Artist name and track name) which they will tell you is a rule laid down by the stores. Anyone other that Ditto will tell you this is utter rubbish. If this were so, perhaps they can explain all the releases in all the stores with label logos and release numbers in the design? Perhaps they could also explain why I've just signed up with a distribution company who accepts these things, no problem? Ditto aren't even consistent with this. One time you'll upload a release with these details on the design and it'll get accepted. Another time you'll find out on release day (when you've done a load of promo etc) that it's been rejected on these grounds, forcing you to start from scratch and severely delaying the release. Bear in mind that for every query you'll usually be waiting between 10 days and 2 weeks to even get a reply. Sound like a fun way to run a label? I can assure you this is what you'll be up against, hence I can honestly say without even exaggerating this company have been extremely bad for my mental health and it's no wonder. If you're looking for a company you can work with, who you feel are on your side and can trust with your creations, PLEASE take this onboard and keep looking. There are much better options out there. It's not just me saying it. Unless you want that constant sick feeling in the pit of your stomach like you just can't trust things to go right with your release, I implore you, do NOT go with Ditto Music. I'm about to share my experiences with my (nearly 5000) music industry friends on Facebook to warn them too. It's the least I can do after what they have put me through. One star feels way too generous but zero isn't an option on here. I feel elated and cleansed to have finally got this vile company out of my system.PS (29.02.24) Just need to add this...I see Ditto have written the following underneath my review...""Hi there!We tried to reach out to you and we never heard back. If you would like to discuss anything feel free to open a chat. Our support team are always on hand.Have a wonderful day!""Just to clarify for Ditto and for people reading this, I was not asking for Ditto to get in touch. As I made clear from the outset... I have cut ALL ties with this company. I am now in the beautiful position of NOT trying to get hold of them or want anything from them at all. In keeping with their whole attitude which grated on me so badly for 6 or so years, they are just trying to make themselves look good with this statement and also make me look unreasonable. I gave this company chance after chance to do right to no avail.Here's the cruncher though...They did NOT get in touch. No emails or anything from them. Ditto if you're reading... I didn't get your email, message or whatever and I definitely don't want an email or any contact with you ever again thanks.Back I go to facebook to tell my 4952 music friends about this latest experience with you.I'd leave me alone now if I were you Ditto.Thanks :)",2024-02-29T15:37:06.000Z,"December 19, 2023",Andrew Turner,1,GB,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6581c35c92121cf574983fdf,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/6581c32b55b4aa00126ec700

657501e547447279311970ab,1,‼️ Ditto Music is complete Garbage ‼️,"Where to begin... Honestly, what a terrible experience it has been with Di++o Music, and it still is.. This is my *honest* felt review after 2 years:My releases (even though they are rightfully mine and distributed under my company's name, including the artwork) keep getting rejected. I recently received another email stating an ''urgent problem with my release''. Even though, there isn't, even after retrying 6 TIMES. Yeah, wow. 👏Does the support team care? No. Does simply reaching out to them help? No. Do they even manually review your concern/problem? No. Do they still charge you monthly to use their service even though you're getting horribly treated as a user? Yes. The Ditto Support Team members have surprisingly mastered the art of not giving a crap about their customers. Even though I tried reaching out to them simply asking for assistance, they kept ignoring my emails and declining my release requests. Just uploading your custom-made music to YouTube yourself is more beneficial than relying on distributors like Ditto Music. Trying to release your OWN-MADE track you have put your time and effort into will most likely go to waste by their crappy system. ❗ Please dear stranger, stay away and do NOT use their website to put your hard work on, they take your money and slap you in the face with every bit of hope on a possible revision. I didn't wish to write this review and would have never needed to in the first place if the unnecessary and unfair problems I kept receiving had just been looked into and given the chance to be resolved. 🤷‍♂️💡 I hope that this review has encouraged people to avoid future tragedies by using this incredibly outdated and unloved service, their credibility is highly overrated and has most likely been faked to the extent of baiting people into using it. ✍️ Edit: Forgot to quickly mention that they don't provide the latest music categories as well. So you're also left off by placing your track in the wrong one because you do not have a choice. Their features are old and unclear, as there are no tutorials whatsoever about basic and quite important questions online. Only extremely specific unrelated ones to the music industry, this is verifiable if you look into the socials they run. Thank you for reading and stay safe music composers!

For me, Ditto Music is very easy to use and is very user-friendly. What I really like about Ditto Music is it's not so expensive to pay yearly compared to other Distributing services/platforms. Of course, it depends if you plan to buy their promotional campaign which still makes the price very well worth it, and I plan to try out this campaign soon enough.Ditto Music also has articles and videos available to read and watch which answered many of my questions. For Example, when I still started out releasing covers, I was a little confused with technical terms, but through a video of Ditto Music, I learned how to effectively release covers.I soon plan to release my original music through Ditto Music, and I believe it's all gonna be great!Thanks Ditto Music!",2023-12-01T10:27:42.000Z,"December 01, 2023",Aizack Fenix,1,PH,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/656998fe342fd87ae70233a8,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/656998ebff4b9d00121b3d86

6565018b43600b507b0dff4f,2,This is a shame,"This is a shame, I could have given them a higher rating but this has really annoyed me.  Should have read the small print early on!  They did a great job a releasing all my music, though I couldn't afford to pay for another year and as I wasn't making much music, so I let the years subscription come to an end.  I thought that they would just continue to collect royalties for me which I could withdraw at a later date when times are hard, well, that's now, and what do I find?  I need to pay them for another subscription just to claim the small amount of royalties my music has earned!  I have £70 in royalties held by them, I initially paid £70 for a years subscription, their lowest priced plan is £20, so I'm not even going to break even to get that money, seems like a total scam.. seriously, eventually artists will have to decide whether taking out another plan is worth it, and there will come a point when they decide it's not, meanwhile this company will still be claiming royalties, accumulating it in their bank account, that is unless you decide to have all your music taken down, which sucks for the artist either way. Think I'll just stick to Bandcamp in the future, ok, so it's just one platform, but at least there's no subscription fees, as Bandcamp take a cut there and then, you know exactly what you're getting.This service would be fairer if they just took a percentage of the sales you make, to cover their admin costs, they could charge a small fee for each release, turns out that Feiyr does exactly that.To make matters worse, I initially had 3 artists set up, in order to take the royalties out, I'm forced to have to take down two of the releases in order to be able to select the lowest priced plan!! It's not a great service for small artists that are struggling to get by, if you're a popular artist then it makes more sense to go with them.It sucks when you do the hard work but someone else makes the profit.",2023-11-30T23:55:41.000Z,"November 27, 2023",John Snook,3,GB,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6565018b43600b507b0dff4f,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/6512eaed548d23001243f25c

65307665310f24b35e9f9f9c,1,Avoid at all costs - much better alternatives,"Despite uploading well in advance of the release date for a release of two singles, only one of the two tracks made it to the stores on the release day. It was only uploaded two days before so all windows for editorial playlists on spotify were missed. I had sent multiple contacts in advance of this expressing my concern and received some non-committal responses initially saying that releases were prioritised by proximity to release date, not by upload date. After receiving one response they stopped responding to my emails. It's obvious they haven't got the staffing available to meet the demand they're getting and the quality of the service has fallen through the floor. They've also made it much harder to contact their support team and are unresponsive on their contact channels. I'll be switching to an alternative that actually has the foresight to hire staff to meet demand and the care to support their artists.  Excerpt from an email I sent after the tracks hadn't been uploaded with a week to go til the release date: ""to be considered for Spotify Editorial playlists, the tracks need to be uploaded to Spotify at least a week before the release date, and the earlier it's pitched the better. If you guys are only able to stay on top of getting releases uploaded within a few days of their release dates, you need to hire more staff to support this. By only sorting the uploads at the last second, you're depriving artists using your service of opportunities - for editorial playlists and release radar, as the track is only added here if it's been pitched. If artists have the foresight to upload their tracks early, they should be present on the backend early so they have plenty of time for editorial playlist pitching.""",2023-10-19T02:20:53.000Z,"October 19, 2023",Sturt Avenue,1,AU,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/65307665310f24b35e9f9f9c,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/653076574c99810012d640ca

652ffd2b11b46472e277731d,2,Updated Review: 01/12/2023,"Low Budget Vanity PublishingI have been with Ditto Music for over 3 months now and I don't think they are for everyone. For small artists, if your passionate about your music then I would say they are not for you. If you just want to put stuff out there to say you have but didn't wish to take it further, then go for it. Below are the pros and cons from my experience with Ditto MusicPros- Affordable. Their pricing is very competitive.- They are quick at getting back to you when you have an issue. (Note: its more than likely you will have an issue)- Does what it says on the tin, uploads music to where it needs to be- Staff are friendly and helpful.Cons- The Review process is pointless. It takes 10 days or so to get your song on the various platforms. For 8/9 days it will usually sit in 'In Review' status. Its worth noting that they don't actually review anything, so if any issues crop up, nothing will happen. - No matter what date you select or how much notice you give Ditto Music before a realise, you will never make New Music Friday on Spotify. This is something that is essential for every single release you will ever make, so for them not to be able to do this makes them unusable, regardless of price. Summery and final thoughtI never felt any passion from them about music at all. It felt like the entire company is probably ran for profit. The people you will speak to will be helpful and friendly, but I have no doubt they will be over worked and under payed, so please don't blame the staff here. Until they are able to get everything set up 7 days+ before your release then there is no point in using them. Overall, if you are a big artist and already have a fan base then Ditto Music will probably be fine, you'll already have enough traction to find new fans anyway. For small artists starting out, although this is cheap, you need to be with a distributor who can make sure you will hit New Music Friday to find new fans. If they can fix this then that'll be a game changer. If you just want your music online as more of a vanity project then this is the perfect place.",2023-12-01T10:52:02.000Z,"October 18, 2023",Jayacus,1,GB,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/652ffd2b11b46472e277731d,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/652ffd19c162dd0012eeb7cf

I don't understand on their sites they say that publications are made between 3 and 5 days when in reality you can count on 10 days at best or if something goes wrong you go back for another 10 days.With other distributors like w_w_w_audiowundr_com, it takes 48 hours and only costs you 11 USD a year. What's more, you can publish as many artists as you like.They take the liberty of denigrating DK, but you should know that DK is light years ahead of your services.DITTO is fine if your aim is simply to upload your tracks passively.Don't make the mistake of promoting yourself or using your own strategy. They'll immediately label you as a ""fraudulent activity"", a term that's used in all sorts of ways.Finally, even if a user is flagged, only those streams deemed unacceptable should be withdrawn, and you still earn the little you've earned.What other distributors do.In conclusion, I strongly advise against Ditto.Look for other small distributors who cost much less and with whom you'll have a real relationship.",2023-10-17T13:14:50.000Z,"October 17, 2023",Clément Perdereau,1,US,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/652e6caaa96be8737aa7d665,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/652e68a054f53600128cbb69

As soon as you make an audience, they strike you to force you to work with the MAJORs.So we've been the unjust victims of strikes.However, we were paid a share of our royalties, and when the time came to withdraw, it was a disaster.DITTO used the opportunity to keep them and at the same time ban our account.That's what the support told us:""we have decided to close your account because you have continued to engage in fraudulent activity"".Please explain how we can continue to communicate on striked content that has become unavailable on the platforms?To conclude.

64feb47c1aea882d102c0c0c,1,DON'T USE DITTO!!!,"Ditto has been a massive disappointment. I have released 26 songs and also run a music label that has released another 8 songs with other artists and have 3 on deck. I have been using Ditto since 2021. Ditto seems to have a problem with sending your songs to the stores in a reasonable amount of time before the release date. I have submitted songs 8 weeks in advance and the song didn't get sent to stores until the week of the release. I have probably only gotten 4 songs out of 34 that were sent to stores more then a week before the release date. Other than that, all the other songs I don't even have the chance to pitch to Spotify editorial playlist. I have emailed them numerous times about this issue and they never seem to have an answer. Almost two years and this is still a problem today. This tells me they don't care about the artists and/or music labels, it is a shame. I am writing this now because I messaged almost a week ago, since I have a release scheduled with a new artists, I sent it in 6 weeks before the release date and the song has yet to be released to stores and it is now 4 days away from release date and I have yet to get a response, like I mentioned it has almost been 1 week since my message. I have another release two weeks after this, I expect the same. How can anyone run a label if the distributor is M.I.A. and is not easy to work with and doesn't want to improve their service? This just tells me they do not respect any of us, they just don't care.  I am just very disappointed and I hope that anyone that reads this does not waste their time and money using DITTO. Use any distributor but DITTO.UPDATE OCTOBER 15, 2023:Their response to this review is exactly what you will get when you have a concern/issue. They will tell you they do their very best to get releases out in time, but they never do and they just don't care.So, since my review I have had numerous issues and questions, which they aren't responding to anymore (one of my artists from my label, his song attached to wrong artist profile). They just screwed up my most recent release attaching it to my previous release, I don't know why, and they didn't send the song some of the major stores like Apple and iTunes( I always click send to all stores). I tried to see and edit if I could send to other major stores (in my dashboard) but I don't have the option to do so. I just took down my release because of this (song was released on Friday, now it's Sunday). I haven't heard from DITTO in over two weeks (from a previous issue I am having and a couple of questions), I have messaged their chat support and emailed them directly multiple times. Again, I can't say this enough, save the stress and look for a different distributor. I am now researching other options and soon  will be switching to another distributor.",2023-10-15T22:45:32.000Z,"September 07, 2023",ZWN,7,US,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/64feb47c1aea882d102c0c0c,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/57d4b0750000ff000a433ed3

Very easy to share your music with the world however, I have had some issues in the past where my music had to be held back from release due to my own errors when filling out the meta data. The customer service could be a little better as if you choose to have a standard release (have to wait 10 days) and something goes wrong in publishing on your end, these guys like to give you a one day notice before the scheduled release, and make you wait another 10 days after repair. However this is expected from the cheap annual price.

64dfbf15ad9cd34e4ef23354,1,Ditto Music Distributor - A Potential Scam Company,"I am writing this review to warn fellow musicians and artists about my deeply disappointing experience with Ditto Music Distributor. My encounter with this company has been nothing short of a nightmare, and I feel compelled to share my story to prevent others from falling into the same trap.From the very beginning, Ditto Music presented itself as a reliable and promising platform for independent artists seeking to distribute their music to various streaming services and online stores. However, my experience with them has been a stark contrast to their claims.First and foremost, their customer service is virtually non-existent. I reached out to them with a few inquiries regarding the distribution process and encountered a prolonged delay in their response. When they did finally get back to me, their answers were vague and unhelpful, leaving me even more confused than before.The real trouble began after I decided to go ahead and distribute my music through Ditto. Their platform seemed user-friendly at first glance, but as I navigated through the process, I encountered numerous glitches and errors that hindered the smooth uploading of my tracks. I attempted to contact their support team once again, but my messages went unanswered, leaving me to struggle with these issues on my own.Worse yet, after my music was supposedly distributed, I noticed a significant delay in its appearance on major streaming platforms. When I inquired about this, I received no response from Ditto's support team, leaving me in the dark about the status of my music's distribution.Perhaps the most alarming aspect of my experience with Ditto Music is their dubious financial practices. Not only did they charge me an exorbitant upfront fee for their services, but I also discovered unauthorized transactions on my credit card linked to Ditto Music. These charges were never explained or resolved, despite my multiple attempts to contact the company.In conclusion, my encounter with Ditto Music Distributor has been a complete disaster. Their lack of effective customer service, technical glitches, and questionable financial practices all point to a company that is either incredibly incompetent or, worse yet, intentionally operating as a scam. I strongly advise any independent artist considering Ditto Music to think twice before entrusting them with your music and hard-earned money. There are countless other legitimate distribution options available that will not subject you to the frustration, stress, and potential financial harm that Ditto Music can inflict.",2023-08-18T20:57:25.000Z,"August 01, 2023",ARIYAN MEHEDI,3,BD,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/64dfbf15ad9cd34e4ef23354,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/64dfbeefc353ae001198d37f

Not the worst, I went through it to repair my tracks. I then selected expedited release and payed $40 dollars on July 29th. It said I could expect release within a few hours, max 72 hours. I was relieved to think it would get out in time to the date I told everyone July 30th, but instead, it selected august 8th which is over 9 days away. Im furious and just defeated that I can't share a project I worked so hard on, on time. I payed extra for a fast release and did not receive one and I feel like I got robbed. In the height of this emergency there are not operators available, and I get it is the weekend, but how is there no way for me to get emergency help. The past few times I've released with ditto, it always goes wrong, and this was almost like a nail in a coffin for me. Always getting my music put on the wrong pages, and maybe that's the stores fault, but this time ditto really was not here for me as a small independent artist. I really want to have faith but to spend money to have a track to be released ASAP and that becomes 10 days is a terrible feeling.

64a407beed41afc45b4ac149,1,Online support is terrible,"Online support is terrible. It states it answers in 4 hours or so but for days no response. Issue relates to an album being rejected because of 'copyright' issues, however, all music is original and owned by self. It was released previously and then withdrawn from another provider, to be released on Ditto. Support came back and said ""remove samples and re-submit"". However, there are no samples, it is all live music that was released back in 2015! I asked 'what sample(s) are you talking about, as there are none' and they responded with 'we don't know and are unable to tell?!?'. So, that is like being charged for murder and you ask who you actually murdered? Then them saying 'we don't know, but your still going to jail lol.I have since re-submitted with all my PPL registration evidence of 100% ownership, yet this was still rejected.",2023-07-04T13:51:26.000Z,"July 04, 2023",reole,1,GB,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/64a407beed41afc45b4ac149,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/64a407a9c8b3ef001145163d

649da879c04d49172a4cb35d,1,Trying to moderate artwork,"Uploaded an album remaster earlier last year, this album had previously been distributed by them ten years ago. When processing, they kept kicking the album back because the artwork contained text that did not feature in the title and kept trying to blame Apple for this. I think they're just being picky, release went through fine through an alternative distributor. Now trying to upload a live release which is again being pushed back because it didn't state that it was live, despite the word ""Live"" not appearing on the artwork. Make your bloody mind up, don't tell artists how they should present their artwork because you feel you need to moderate artistic output. Just accept it and move on. Going to try and find a way to move the back catalogue across from Ditto to some other reputable distributor, trying to also find a way to never use Ditto ever again and to warn musician friends to avoid them also.

They don't send the releases to stores until 24h before release date because they have an ""express release"" offer for 50 EUR they want to force you to. This way it is not possible for you to make successful spotify pitches. Moreover, they reject the release if something is not spelled or on the artwork the way they want it to. They rejected releases because I spelled it ""VIP"" instead of ""V.I.P"", ""Melissa S."" in the metadata and ""Melissa"" on the artwork, which was ok on a different artwork with the exact same lettering and fonts. This wouldn't be that bad if they would not change the release date to somewhere later if something goes wrong.

This is 'apparently' to meet Apple's artwork guidelines, despite quickly finding countless other releases (many major) that are contrary to these.They've also delayed releases to question 'what the language the music was in', or their automatic system errenously thinks a song is a cover etc.Second, the support is shockingly poor - I've often waited 5 days for a response before getting a stock reply sent by somebody who didn't past my first sentence, yet they'll close off your ticket if you don't reply within 24 hoursThe website has always been buggy and a chore to use, especially when requesting payouts!

645d6be25f13b19b7c6153f8,1,Beware of Ditto Music's Deceptive Practices,"Initially, Ditto Music lured me in with their promise of unlimited releases per artist through an annual subscription. However, it quickly became evident that their claims were nothing more than empty promises. The songs I uploaded for distribution were consistently delayed, leaving me frustrated and unable to effectively promote my music.What's even more alarming is their exploitative tactic of offering an ""express release"" package for an additional fee. It became apparent that Ditto Music deliberately delayed the standard releases, coercing artists into paying extra to ensure their songs reached streaming platforms on time. This predatory approach demonstrates a complete disregard for the success and well-being of the artists they claim to support.Moreover, their excuse of increased review times due to high upload volumes is nothing but a feeble attempt to mask their deceit. It is clear that their priority lies in extracting additional money from artists rather than providing a reliable and efficient distribution service.I strongly caution fellow artists to stay away from Ditto Music. Their false promises and deceptive practices only serve to hinder artists' careers and exploit their hard work.

There's a lot of decent distribution companies within the industry. There are also alot who masquerade as being decent but when you dig a little deeper you find all is not as it seems. I believe the 2 most important attributes a distribution co needs to have are an efficient release process & good communication. The one name that kept rising to the top of my shortlist was Ditto Music. They fitted all the criteria we were looking for. We are now 6 releases in with Ditto and any time we've needed to communicate with them they've been there for us. Their subscription fees are reasonably priced meaning you don't have to be a millionaire to get your music out there. Their website is super user friendly and really easy to use.

The solutions provided by Ditto to transfer the money are not good enough for me, in my opinion. I aways have to pay some taxes and/or to pay feeds to transfer the money.

The only experience I've had that came close was when uploading my album 'Curiosity Killed The Cat'. As it turned out, the sound of birdsong in the title track (which I had pulled over from Apple Loops on Garageband) was copyrighted and therefore the entire album's release had to be postponed to a week later. This wasn't a problem or anything, but although I had uploaded the music for review in the middle of February, I received the email (stating that something was wrong) the day before the scheduled release (1st March). I felt that the system could have been a little more efficient, but it wasn't a problem. After all, I had made the mistake of using the loop in the first place. Other than that, Ditto has been very reliable and helpful. My music always releases on the correct date, and seeing the numbers go up for various different streaming services makes me very happy.

I have 6 releases now through Ditto and it is all so straight forward and no catches etc. I haven't had any cause to contact them up until my most recent release but I found it to be a very simple and positive experience.I had uploaded the incorrect cover for my EP and they made it very easy for me as they just did everything for me! I just sent them the correct cover and they sorted it out even though it had already been released.They distribute to so many different platforms (about 200 I think) and for the reasonable annual charge I think it is excellent value for money.Keep up the good work Ditto!,2023-03-08T02:48:08.000Z,"March 06, 2023",Peter Flood,2,GB,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6407db4857f009f69590feb0,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/59e48e690000ff000ad57a0f

63fa39f89b64b1bdaf6281f8,1,Bad Customer Service and Product,"Would love to give more stars because it is a cheap option that does eventually get your music out there, but the customer service is terrible. It takes a week or more for them to get back to you, and if you submit music months in advance, they won't get it reviewed and sent to stores until days before release day, which means no submitting to playlists. If you are an artist starting out they aren't great for getting exposure, unless of course you are willing to shill out another $500 for their promotion package. My biggest complaint is that they have a bad system for reviewing music and answering customer questions. Most of the faq is vague, and like I said, customer service will take their time getting back to you. There is no number to call, just their inefficient ticket system. I have had bad experience after bad experience every time I have tried to release music. Not once has a release gone off without me having to pull teeth from the customer service team to get them to help me. If it didn't only cost $20 for a full year, I would have already switched over.

63e10af9745e4800219c50ac,1,Don't sign off all your copyrights to Ditto Music,"We were (!) interested in releasing some music with Ditto Music after an advertisement on Youtube Shorts. Then we came across clauses in their terms and conditions - see link here: (Find their home page and go to subfolder en and terms - where they write :B) a royalty free, world-wide exclusive licence of the following rights as these rights are defined in the 1988 Copyright, Designs and Patents Act:The Performing RightThe Dubbing RightThe New Media Communication RightThe New Media Dubbing RightThe Foreign Rights Management RightThe International New Media Communication RightThe International New Media Dubbing Right- And one of us have now asked them what this is about. The occurrence of the word ""Exclusive"" and ""Royalty free"" in the same sentence where our prospect copyrights are concerned is concerning to say the least. One literally signs off all one's rights with that clause. There are further clauses in the same ""agreement"" which could make the small hairs in the neck rise.We are living in a free world, and any musician, however desperat he or she is, should indeed be free to act with a distributor like Ditto Music who are indeed free to design their clauses like above. It is however so, that this means that a hopeful musician may sign over his rights without any guarantee for any return. There are no calculations what so ever of royalties - only very vague descriptions of what Ditto Music intend to pay. Well. We lost interest. This legalese can be done much better, to the benefit of both musicians and Ditto Music themselves.===== 10 Feb 2022 =====The above stands. They say they tried to reach out. That is not true. I do not have any emails or anything else from Ditto. In fact they do not need to respond to me.

The funny thing: Nearly every song on that album was acsepted as a standalone single by Ditto months before. After a bit I did contacted our CD Distributor CDBaby and told them what happened to me and they helped me out activate that album also for digital distribution and went right away with it getting it out, do to beeing cleared before that.

63dd076b9b64b1bdaf4bd803,1,Kafkaesque Chat Robot Prevents our Release,"Sixteen days ago, we tried to release our music under a new name through Ditto, who'd released it the first time round under our old name. We waited and waited, our release didn't happen. A couple of days after asking their chat robot why (they don't do telephone support), we were told the old release was still active and needing deleting before we could ""re-upload"" our tracks under our new name. Did we want to delete the old release? Yes, we did. We were then told this had been done and that our tracks would be released under our new name within 48 hours. Days later this still hasn't happened, but our old release is still on Spotify. We message their chat robot again, to be told: ""your release is inactive because your old release is still active. If you have requested this to be deleted, you may re-upload your tracks under your new name."" So when the previous chat robot had told us our tracks would be released under the new name within 48 hours, it was lying? And despite our old release still being on Spotify, and despite multiple requests to remove it, and despite Ditto stating clearly that we can't release our music under a new name until the old release has been deleted, we're still being asked to re-upload our tracks, only to have the same kafka-esque cycle repeat itself?? All they have to do is delete our old release. It's been 16 days. JUST DO IT. DELETE OUR OLD RELEASE SO IT NO LONGER APPEARS ON SPOTIFY. And let us know when it's done. And respond to our messages.

Ditto will check your release a week before and find problems that no other distributor has, such as generic wording in the song title and other made up crap. I have released rejected tracks with other distributors and there's never been an issue. Also, if you decide to ""repair"" the release by for example adjusting the title, a new release date is set, which means you miss the intended one. I've sent numerous emails to the support dating 3 weeks back in time and I still haven't received a single response. I can pretty much guarantee they'll be out of business and it is by far the worst service I've ever experienced.

637a0d07252cba2c02de2a5d,5,Pros and cons of ditto,"Ive been using ditto for over a year now so your going to get a honest review. Everytime i release something they map it to the wrong artist profile. The ditto promo is not worth it i was robbed for £400  was promised playlists and real streams and fans and i did not gain one real extra follower or my streams did not even change i just got given press releases from veryyy low magazines and a few graphics. And was also told i can not get a refund so i suggest not using that promo as it will leave you devostated. You will randomly find other artist music on your profile. Royalties take forever to come in ive been using ditto about a year and a half now and ive still not recieved my napster royalties and most of my youtube, spotify etc. but apart from all that the ditto team are very helpful they will resolve issues within a few days or on the same day if you message them early. Its easy to use the website and upload music and videos etc. you can release as many tracks as you like for only £19.99 a year fee. They have their own blog that covers everything in music plus their own youtube channel showing you how to do stuff. Ive not seen any other distributor doing this. When i started music i reasearched distributors and i can honstly say i am happy with my choice i made. As i said ill be giving a honest review not all music distributors are gunna be perfect you will have issues just depends how those issues are resolved and ditto have a great team. Granted my promo was not refunded but in there defence it does say its not refundable.

I do not recommend this company. CD-Baby, TuneCore etc are more serious, reliable and customer oriented. I suspect that royalties is withheld/reduced. The data they show for streams from Spotify doesn't match the data from Spotify artist dashboard at all (compared to other aggregators I use). The difference between the data that Spotify dashboard reports and the streams Ditto report is up to the several hundreds thousands of streams. I have asked about this but got no answer. And there's no way to get hold of them either - if you don't shout out in social media...then they act and respond. On top of all this, Ditto have several times missed the publishing dates (witch of course sabotages the PR connected to releasedates, events, clips etc)  - even if you give them more than months to upload songs to the streaming services. They also hold back your money for weeks so their ""staff"" can clear the payment.

However, one of their representatives called Morgan contacted me and acknowledged my frustration instead of taking the robotic and 'broken record' line of repeating 'Ditto pay artists 100% of their royalty payments' which another representative did over and over despite this statement being clearly wrong.

626a66660c4813f76bf707b2,1,Most enormous headache to release anything,"Releasing music via Ditto is the most frustrating experience imaginable.I have now released two albums, both of which caused massive headaches, with a third having been sent to them over a month ago but still not being able to be released.It seems that every time you send off a release, they will find some way to block the release, without giving a reason.Instead, you will receive a generic email about how song titles and album titles 'can't contain generic words and word groupings or titles intended for search optimisation'.This seems to happen every time, whether any of your songs have generic, search-optimised titles or not, but they won't tell you which of the songs on the album has triggered the oversensitive filters.This means that, if you want to resolve the issue, you have to send them a support ticket, which will take a number of days to finally reach them, before someone eventually tells you what's supposedly wrong with the  release.But sometimes, even if you then change something and send off for release, it will just come back blocked again. I tried so many different non-generic titles for my first album, and had to wait multiple days for them to process it and then block it each time, before eventually getting it released.On this occasion, in addition to this issue, I've been flagged for copyrighted content. This seems to be due to the use of royalty-free Apple loops that come with Logic. (I've checked the license agreement, and the material is free for commercial use.)Of course, because I have used various Apple loops in a few of the different tracks I've uploaded, I have no idea which one is actually getting flagged, so I again have to wait for them to get back to my support ticket to work out which one, and I still don't know what I'm actually supposed to do to just get this thing finally released.The amount of time and effort that you will have to waste to get something released on Ditto is not worth the hassle.

And one that  had real humans to help me in every step I was to make in ensuring my artists had their tracks released to the world. I could not let them down.I had to place trust in a company. DITTO was showing You Tube videos  on how to do things.. and more. so I took a chance.I admit I am no newbie.. quite computer literate, an ex ghost songwriter and now a label owner.. but this distribution  was like an alien language! However Support IS THERE.. and despite an auto email after my support request, informing me  a response may be slow.. I have always had my problem resolved within 48 hours. and the DITTO staff must all know me very well by now - because even though I have design AI (Application Interfaces) with Usability in mind..experience, I do find some of the distribution interface confusing. But If I do something and I realise Ive done it wrong- those friendly professional and knowledgeable support staff are on hand and even explain things to me.

623b248dab0a5e0f74811e59,4,It is good but loses in several aspects to other distributors.,"I think Ditto Music is a great distributor, but it doesn't have some basic things that other distributors have and that's why I think it loses a lot of customers. When you release a song and confirm it, you can only edit it by sending a ticket, I think this is very bad for the platform because support takes 7 to 12 days and if the musician wants to release the song quickly. Another thing that several distributors have that is super interesting that Ditto doesn't have is the Pitch in the launch itself or for the distributor's own playlists or Apple/Spotify etc, most distributors have a pitch or partnership with streaming companies, in my view I think Ditto is good, but very vague.",2022-03-23T13:45:49.000Z,"March 23, 2022",Lucas César Lopes,1,BR,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/623b248dab0a5e0f74811e59,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/623b247fce39a70012028068

62399bdeab0a5e0f747fc7ff,1,Extremely Disappointed,I am very disappointed with Dittos customer service team and the overall experience that we have had from the service. As a label we rely on our distributor (DITTO) to ensure that our music is released by the date quested and is linked to the correct profiles on streaming platforms. We have had three occasions where our music has been uploaded and linked to incorrect profiles on Spotify and Apple which has impacted our artist in marketing and advertising their music. It is very unprofessional and gives our label a bad reputation. Frankly it is an embarrassment! Dittos's ticket system for support is lengthy and vague and on this third occasion has still not been able to resolve our issue. An artist account has now been created on Spotify and Apple however the release is now not linked to their profile/ catalogue. It would be much easier to speak with a real human being in order to resolve these issues. Sadly we will not be renewing our subscription with Ditto and will be going with a new distributor for our next release and artist re-release. Such a shame. I would not recommend their services to anyone unfortunately.,2022-03-22T11:20:19.000Z,"March 22, 2022",Rogue Label,1,GB,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/62399bdeab0a5e0f747fc7ff,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/62399bc81f97450012da4f5c

It's quick and simple to submit releases and is clear with what is required. there is a set price for a yearly charge to be able to submit as much music as you want each year, no hidden fees and no charge for individual submissions. you also have access to royalties and you can get yourself a vevo channel through ditto too. the only negative experience I have had with ditto is sudden issues with my release just before I planned on releasing something, making my release date go further back. However ditto has became alot more clearer with what I specifically need to change with a release before I can have it sent to stores. Last time I had this problem I got a ticket sent with a very detailed list of things that had to be changed and ditto actually automatically made these changes themselves, something that never used to be a thing when I first joined ditto, so it is nice to see them actively making releasing music more streamlined and simple for users.",2022-02-19T14:48:03.000Z,"February 19, 2022",Oscar,2,GB,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/62110323bc5a51af69c776bb,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/62110315b4891c0012b744dd

6209acbd441cb9c2473806e5,1,"Horrible Customer Service, Even Worse For Public Domain Samplers","The service does what it’s supposed to, when it works. When it doesn’t work, good luck getting any help. Example: I have to reach out to Customer Service for some reason or another, so I send an e-mail. I wait several days for a response that does not help me, and if I reply to that e-mail, I simply dont get a response. So I have to copy and paste the first correspondence into a brand new e-mail, send it off and wait a few more days for another response and then repeat the whole process if I have to reply again. This has happened many times, whether it being due to them billing me twice for a single year, or other issues. Which brings me to my biggest complaint…i use public domain samples in a few of my songs, and they claim they have no way of releasing these songs due to the samples. You have the option of saying I’m not using any copyrighted works or I am using copyrighted works and here are the documents allowing me to use them. There is no in between, such as with public domain materials. I’ve explained that the materials used are indeed public domain, and they say they cannot help me. This has been going on for 2 years, and in that time I’ve seen multiple other sites who do the exact same thing that Ditto does make numerous improvements. Meanwhile, Ditto is still the same barely-functional service it was when I signed up. I’ll absolutely not be renewing my subscription when it’s up for renewal at the end of next month. It’s a shame too, as I think that the actual act of posting a new album is pretty seamless and easy to navigate (unless the page crashes during the upload process, which has happened many times for me).",2022-02-14T01:13:33.000Z,"February 14, 2022",CL,3,CA,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6209acbd441cb9c2473806e5,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/6209aca5b73bf200137d80fc

61f52acea16c1e751f782eac,1,Awful - stay away,"Awful. Three releases and all went full of problems, every next being worst than the previous. I must admit support officers do really try to help, but it feels like they are struggling with their own company as much as I did.At all times my release date where screwed, my metadata was broken, I had to take down releases and re-submit them. It always meant broken release dates, broken PR-activities, extra-charges for re-submission, as every time I had to pay again. In one case - three times. So instead of 140€ the album did cost me 420€. That’s before I’ve dived into their ‘label in a box’ thing, which turned out to be just a box and a subscription plan, as by end of the day they did not open company and bank account for me (as promised when you purchase) and I’ve ended up doing that myself. But I’ve got the branded pen! Which by the way dried out pretty quickly, as if it spent couple of years in the storage before getting to me.Moral: do not run for cheapest guys, there are plenty of services out there. Even if you google ditto, one of the first things you’d see would be stories of their unreliability and problems. Great as idea, but the realization and the outcome are simply horrible, costing time, money and nerve cells. Not worth it at all. Skip for any other service and it will be better for sure. As soon as I’m finished with current releases I’m leaving them for sure and would be happy to never look back and forget about this service as soon as possible.",2022-01-29T11:57:06.000Z,"January 29, 2022",Eugene,1,AE,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/61f52acea16c1e751f782eac,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/61f52a93f6b4b8001286d886

6152fe57215cfcced27243df,1,Abysmal customer service. One year on and still no royalties. Get your act together Ditto!,"Just for some context - this is the first negative review I’ve ever written! But Ditto’s customer service is a joke - I’m fed up, and I want the royalties I’m owed.It seems that Ditto are good at digital distribution, but terrible at dealing with any hiccups along the way.I logged on to my account to see a withdrawal for £79. There was a notice next to it saying that Ditto no longer used BACS to transfer funds, but now used Payoneer, and this £79 had been sent to my Payoneer account. But there was also a red box on my dashboard saying that Ditto were unable to set up a Payoneer account for me?! So I got in touch and asked for the money to be added back on to my Ditto account balance so I could set up Payoneer myself/verify my identity which I thought was the issue. The employee I dealt with said this was not a problem and she’d let me know when this had been done.A year later I remembered I was owed some royalties and checked back to find it still hadn’t been added on to my Ditto balance. I opened a support ticket and after a week of waiting for a reply they closed my support ticket with no response. After that I wrote again and asked for some help getting the money I was owed, and they said they’d talk to Payoneer. Payoneer have now said the money was withdrawn last year - during the time I was told by Ditto that I wasn’t able to set up a Payoneer account! I don’t understand why the previous employee understood the issue but didn’t reinstate the balance. It feels like the person I’m dealing with now doesn’t grasp what has happened, and the response time is slow. I’ve been actively trying to sort this for over a month now, and I know it’s not a vast amount of money, but every little helps, and it’s the principle.All in all - avoid! It’s not worth the risk and frustration.

60fa9300f9f487044c463acc,1,"Too long to review, terrible support","""Edit""So things got worse - if you can imagine. On release day, just sent out the smart link for people to stream the song and it is still showing ""presave"" not only that, but it shows the old release date (13th August instead of 20th August) which we had to change as we had to push the single back a week due to how long Ditto took to process it. This is 5 weeks ahead of release date we submitted this song.This is the final straw so we will be using someone else moving forwards.If you want to pitch your song to Spotify editors, you really need at least 3-4 weeks lead time - I know it says 7 days, but in reality, the longer the better.For this reason, it is good to get your songs to your distributor way ahead of time.Unfortunately, it seems with Ditto that the longer ahead of time you send it to them, the longer they take to review it.My most recent release has been in review for nearly 2 weeks - and it gets longer the further away from release date I send it to them - for example, when I sent to them a couple of weeks before release, it was reviewed within a couple of days.And regarding their support - you can be waiting many days for a response.Finally, when trying to actually release a song it constantly says ""your cart is empty"" an issue with their site which they never give a reason for and never seem to fix.Getting worried about royalties now reading some of the comments below...Now looking at alternative distributors so I would advise to avoid them.",2021-08-20T09:48:12.000Z,"July 23, 2021",Bob,2,GB,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/60fa9300f9f487044c463acc,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/60fa92d05380fe0012a4421a

Then we decided to send an email and opened an issue but we never got any emails back, just an automatic message about the card and never got any reply.

However, everything turned topsy turvy last week when they contacted me saying that I have too many streams in Spotify and after I followed up, they said my covers had too many copyright claims - My covers are released on YT first, and Ditto says they  have copyright claims! especially when I sent them to streaming stores?  I really expected better from them. I don't mind if they take down my covers from the stores so that I can use another distributor and upload them. Even that is not being done by them as yet !! I tweeted, contacted them by email, however - it's amazing silence! Please take down my songs if you see copyright issues, else let's at least chat/communicate on email - Not taking them down, shows incorrect intent. Ticket number #438659. Hope you will respond here atleast.Updated after Dittos reply. - You never contacted me prior to suspending. None of my content was fraudulent as they were instrumental covers created by me and You authorised covers to be upload to streaming stores. I replied back to you with proof of emails sent by Ditto where you mentioned its a cover and hence being sent to streaming stores. After no response from you for 3 days in the same support I asked you to takedown my covers if they had issues. You haven't yet taken down any of my covers. Infact after suspension some of my newer covers were sent to stores. If the covers were fraudulent, had issues, why haven't they been taken down yet? I also raised another support ticket for a takedown of 1 song just to check if you are really taking songs down, and I don't have a response yet to the new support ticket(72 hours +) , while you are stating non factual information here. What is the intent of stating something about copyright and Fraud when you don't take down my covers which are getting more than 1000 streams a month. Hence I repeat - you didn't contact me about anything before suspension, I have sent you evidence that you haven't. None of my covers are fraudulent as I have evidence of me creating all of them and all of that content are in public domain on my YT artist channel. You are free to takedown all the covers if you have received complaints about them. So please confirm that you have sent notice to stores to takedown my content if they had issues. Please  confirm that you have taken takedown action as I can't work with a non communicative unreliable distributor. Not taking down my content, and just sending emails or responses that my content is fraudulent and has copyright issues shows fraudulent intent from Ditto and not from me.

608044c0f9f48704b8fa399d,1,Use Anyone Else...,"I run a growing independent label in the UK.I chose Ditto as they have a way to upload multi artist compilations, with automated revenue splits to the artists.That's the only reason I joined and paid a decent amount for a ""label"" plan.So I uploaded the album. It got rejected as there was ""too much writing"" on the artwork. This is the same artwork that was used on the physical releases which sold in the thousands.So I changed the artwork to just the logo.It was rejected as the album name was deemed too ""generic"". I pointed out there are numerous albums that have generic names (1,2,3 etc - Live etc) They said no.Then one day they changed the album name for me to something similar, but not the same. Then I got a mail saying I needed to change the artwork to match this album name that they chose! I had a contract with my artists for an album that wasn't called what they called it, if it HAD been uploaded, I would have been in breech of contract.After toing and froing with their support (not in the UK, as they only respond around midnight) they assured me that this was not their guidelines, but ones laid down by their streaming partners. The release missed the date twice (it seems that they need 7 days to upload it)So I uploaded the album to Spotify, Tidal and Deezer via Distrokid, with the name I wanted and the original artwork which Ditto rejected. It took 24 hours to appear, with no problems.I pointed this out to Ditto, that if their ""guidelines"" are based on their partners requests, why has there been no problems with the Distrokid upload?They ignored my ticket and then closed it.I then got another mail saying that my album name needed changing as it was ""too generic"".I contacted them through Facebook. They said they wanted to sort this out. They ""sorted"" it out by closing my account and give me a refund.Their ""support"" staff seem to be scripted from a set of rules the company bought off Fiverr. Facts and sense mean nothing to them and any repsonses take at least 24 hours and are usually the same boilerplate.They're riding the ""kudos"" that Ed Sheeran & Sam Smith uploaded their first songs with them (years ago).

607acad7f85d750920242f71,5,I made the right choice choosing Ditto,"My band and I are new to the professional music industry. We recorded our first track and we had little to no idea on how to put our songs out there. We did our research and cam across different reviews and opinion of people with their experience on different distribution services. At first, wew didn't really consider ditto. Not even second choice. We signed up for our first distribution choice but unfortunately (or furtunately because if this didn't happen we would be here on ditto), we encountered some problems with our release because they have some certain criteria that needs to be strictly followed (regarding the bit rate of the recorded song). We really can't do anything about it unless we record the track again. This was the time we considered other distribution services and luckily we came across Ditto. This was really one the right choices I made. I read how ditto works, its reviews and other information about them and I immediately signed up and paid for a subscription. I came across some reviews online that Ditto's customer service was very poor. But, I can certainly say they were wrong. We had so many concerns and questions about our release since this was the very first time we used as distrubution service and the customer service was really amazing. Once you send an email to their customer support email, they immediately give you a ticket and say that they are trying their best to accommodate all concerns of the users and I never had a concern that was not reseolved. Plus, the best part is that all my concerns were attended in less than 24 hours despite them having so much concerns from other users to attend to. So I can really recommend Ditto to other artists especially those artists who are new to the industry and need guidance with their release.",2021-04-17T11:47:35.000Z,"April 17, 2021",Zen Nemenzo,1,PH,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/607acad7f85d750920242f71,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/607acacf3dda49001aef45dd

It appears they also have the power to change the terms and condition of the contract when ever they want, so basically, they can switch the goal post. Technically, they own all the rights of your recordings, thus exploiting your songs to kingdom-com. Manipulation with a capital M.

Note that this wrong account was a default one made for me years ago which had absolutely no activity whatsoever e.g no music, bio, images, NOTHING. Whereas my actual account had over 20 songs, bio, images, monthly listeners. A clearly active account. They gave me the excuse that it was the computer system that did this. I have distributed with many many distributors and have never once had this problem, ever!

So I send another email replying to that requesting my song which is not even going to be released onto my account be removed from stores and I get a refund so I can work with a distributor that does its job properly. I then received an email replying to my request with 'if I can respond the correct link to have it changed'. Note that my song is to come out in less than a week at this point. I emailed them the same email about my requests. Today (3 days after) I received another email saying again that I've not responded to their email in 72 hours (even though they replied to my email)?

600085a4755dc1061ce89adc,2,Ditto is great... Until you want paid !,Ditto has been great to work with up until now that I want my payout. I’ve never had any issues before this. They’ve always been quick to address any issues before. The only option they give users for Payouts is Payoneer. If you look at any of the Payoneer social media pages the comments are full of people demanding their money to be released. Payoneer is not releasing peoples money. Personally I’ve been trying to login to my Payoneer account for months and can’t get in. I can’t get a human on the phone when I call their customer service. They’ve finally  responded to an email after emailing them numerous times only tell me my account had been shut down but won’t respond to tell me why or how I can fix the issue so that I can use their service. I’ve contacted Ditto multiple times over the last month or so only to be told “We understand your concern. Unfortunately Payoneer is our only payout option. We will pass this on to our internal team but there are no guarantees that anything will change”. Musicians have been hit hard enough during this pandemic without having to trust our payouts with a company like Payoneer. Ditto doesn’t seem to really be in a rush to make other accommodations for their artist. We are likely going to start shopping around for another distributor for our Record Label. If your thinking about using Ditto I’d first check to make sure that Payoneer isn’t who they are using for Payouts. Like I said above Ditto has been great up until this point. Ditto was great to work with and was always whack to help. Unfortunately they are not doing that now that it comes to financials.If Ditto fixes this issue without telling us we have to use Payoneer I will be updating and or editing my review.,2021-01-14T17:55:48.000Z,"January 14, 2021",Jason,1,US,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/600085a4755dc1061ce89adc,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/60008593044ec1001a261ea8

The customer service is quick and fast as you can chat them directly. I live in Indonesia, so it's quite a time difference, but they replied fast. The only downside, is the royalty report which you can't see your stats beyond 30 days and it quite slow compare to distrokid in reporting your royalties. Overall, It's been a good experience so far.(Update). I,ve just  received my first royalty payout recently . Honesty, i am quite nervous reading all the negative comment of ditto not paying royalty. But i can say it's not true. As long as you are not doing shady stuff like bot streaming, or other illegal fraud streaming  method , i believe you should be fine.The process tooks me around three weeks from the first royalty report. Then your royalty were held for pending clearance verification. I submitted my ticket for clearance support. And it tooks a while to get replied. I live chatted ditto cs a few time, and they can't help much because it's a different department and they have limited access. I appreciated their help. Then once you received email from clearance department, you can withdraw your royalty to payoneer. It tooks me around 3 days to get the payout money into my local bank.the good things, ditto dont cut any tax or witheld tax like distrokid, 100% exactly from your royalty report and $3 processing fee from payoneer to your local bank.This is my experience, so I cant guarantee it will be the same to everyone.I will update this review once i received my second payout.

I believe this to be unacceptable for any type of company, especially a company holding monetary funds for its user base. In addition to this issue, Ditto have also moved my release date three days after I selected and confirmed its release. They did this by asking me to check and confirm my release didn’t contain “ Titles must not contain generic wording - e.g. Track 1, Future type beat, dance mix 2, acoustic backing track, etc.” By having to confirm this, something that I’ve never had to do before, pushes my release to a later date.

I hadn't played music in a long time but somehow picking up my guitar again and starting to write seemed to make sense. After getting a few tracks written and recorded I started to look around for a distribution company. There are plenty... but, Ditto stood out to me as being solid, totally capable of doing a great job and all for a great price with no hidden extra charges. The artist navigation area is easy and straightforward to use and I actually felt so comfortable with them as a company that after a few months I opted into one of their marketing and promo packages, which to me... didn't seem cheap at the time. But, I felt so comfortable with them that I invested. And, I'm really glad I did. The money was irrelevant with regards what the package actually delivered - it made it seem more than cost-effective. I was surprised by just how much detail went into it and how personalised it all was. But, on top of that, every single member of the Ditto team - and I dealt with about 4 different departments - were all so friendly, helpful and totally professional. They worked like a well-oiled machine. And, even after the process came to an end I had a quick question about something and one of the guys responded to me immediately and provided advice and help.

That happened with CDBaby that we had music out for three years and not knowing it was never showing up on Pandora or Tidal etc... things are everchanging, but the one thing we need to fight for is our talents in the world.  WE need to fight for the artists, the youth of the globe, and the right to have a voice today and platform to use it.We have a whole other album that's just about ready to release, but it's going to be under a completely different artist name than Liv V.  I truly hope someone in charge reads this and would contact us in regards to it and possibly collaborate to benefit both.  We have not signed with anyone and have remained indie over the years.

They mark my singles as ""sent to stores"" and I did receive the ""smart link"" however, after several days I didn't see my single in to my ""upcoming releases"" in Spotify.I did worry about that, and decide to contact Ditto support send them screenshots and so on to prove and help with this matter. However after more than 1 week ignoring my request and not receive nothing back, I decide to contact Spotify. After provide my UPC numbers to Spotify, they ensure me, they didn't receive any release under those numbers. What? how is possible?I decide again to forwards that email to Ditto and wait for any explanation, however the days passed and I still not have an answer. Ridiculous, for me Worst music distributor ever I work with.I supposed the next single will be released next friday, however thanks to this ""amazing"" and ""efficient"" ditto music team, in the case they decide to sent it today, unfortunately, I will be not be elegible for Release radar, neither for a pitch. I must say i did send this single to be released on September 19th, 2020. so there should be enough time.My personal Conclusion: If you care none for your music, then maybe Ditto is for you, as they will show same appreciation for your music as they do to me. however if you care a bit or more, then chose some other distributor.You can see other reviews. and convince yourself.",2020-10-03T23:30:20.000Z,"October 02, 2020",David Cruz Anaya,4,GB,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/5f773e9e798e6f0b341cc4d0,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5b09a0ba4de5666d34af73cd

Sometimes 8 artists want to make music toghether, but Ditto does not allow me to put this 8 artists as main artist. It is something tha could be implemented too because I don't think in music we should have this kind of limitation.

I've been a successful independent artist for the last 10 years. Unfortunately I made the mistake of using Ditto to distribute my own releases over the last 16 months. To cut it short, their customer support is appalling to non-existent, they frequently messed up simple release info and dates, will upload your music to the wrong streaming accounts, and when contacted about issues it takes weeks to resolve simple things.Worst of all they will eventually lock you out of your account without warning, claiming you've been involved with 'artificial' or 'illegal' streaming so you can't access your royalties. Meanwhile your music will stay online and they won't take it down whilst ignoring your emails. This is happening to numerous artists using their service, and something they will eventually do to you. (They currently owe me over $1,000 in royalties)Please save yourself the headache and use a better service. Ditto is cheap, and you get what you pay for. Do yourself a favour and pay the extra money to use another distributor to avoid these issues.

5f681ce902e8570a4876caa5,1,A Company Clearly Going Broke,"I released some music early in 2020 with Ditto music that ended up being featured on an editorial playlist. A huge deal for any musician. Over time I watched as my streams clocked over 100K, 200K, 300K, 400K and up and up. With is, my royalty earnings rose higher and higher. After a few months, back in early August, I saw that figure was sitting at around $3,000. That’s cool right! I’ve been featured on a playlist, people are listing to my music and I’m making a nice little side hustle wage. So I thought, it’s time to cash out. I had followed everything that Ditto asked to the T. Confirmed my identity, bank details and all of that. But while my balance said $3,000 my available balance was $0. I out this down to a technical error and created a support ticket.The reply I received when I asked why I couldn’t cash out was a rude and short message that alluded to me having to wait for them to verify my account and details. Which had already been done months ago. After about 5 days of no reply, I tried to log in to my account and it said ‘incorrect details’. Reset my password and thought my account had been hacked. Nope, it turns out Ditto had decided to lock my account while they ‘verified’ my streams. But I was lucky. I could without a doubt show exactly where 99.99% of my streams came from, the editorial playlist inclusion. I sent over my undeniable proof that matched the data in the Ditto account and showed where all the streams were coming from. One track, off one EP from one playlist on one streaming service. You cannot argue with it. It was as clear as day. The proof I showed matched up exactly.So they shut my account down and banned me for absolutely no reason despite me being able to prove exactly where my streams had come from.But what does this mean? It means that Ditto music have taken full control over my music and IP with the full and knowing intention of taking all my current royalties and to continue to collect on them. I now have no access or control over my music. They will not take the releases down. They will not pay me my royalties. They have straight up stolen my music and my rights to it.My company IP lawyer and my own solicitor both informed me that Ditto can shut my account down at any time. But they cannot in any form take any part of my IP and or its earnings.So I am now in the process of working with Spotify, Apple Music and other distributors to place an IP claim on my OWN music to have it taken down from those services and stores and regain control of my IP.But that isn’t even the most sickening part of it all. Not only did they do all the above, Ditto music are actively fighting my claims. Yes. Fighting me, the rights owner, to keep hold of my IP. This is beyond insanity.As of writing this, I have been successful in getting my music removed from Spotify and some other distributors. Spotify are actually aware of what Ditto is doing, so if you are in my shoes, contact Spotify directly and they will help you. So will Apple Music. But I am still battling to get my music completely removed from Ditto’s control.What Ditto have done to me is completely destroy all and any momentum I had and was gaining by simply seeing I was making money and stealing it. To them it was a quick cash grab. To me and everyone else they have done this to it was a potentially career destroying action.There are thousands of other artists going through this same nightmare right now that leads me to believe that Ditto Music is going broke. There is no company that would expect to survive another 6-12 months that would dream of doing anything near this illegal and down right disgusting.I am extremely fortunate that this was a side project for me and that I was not hoping to create a career from my music. But for many people who use Ditto music and are going through this, it is absolutely devastating.It is clear that Ditto’s respect for its customers is so low that they not only are happy to steal from them in the worst possible way, but are also happy to do it believing that many of them do not know how and or cannot afford to fight them legally on the matter.If you have been affected by the same thing here, keep an eye out on the internet.I have a feeling a UK based class action against Ditto Music and the twin brother CEO-Founders will not be very far off. And when it does get started, be sure to join it. I know I will be. It won’t cost you anything and when it is won, you will get the money they owe you, the control of your music back and more.I’ll end this saying that if you’re considering any music distribution service, I goes without saying that Ditto is not the one.",2020-09-21T03:24:25.000Z,"September 21, 2020",Dave,1,AU,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/5f681ce902e8570a4876caa5,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5f681c7c0ad3a025451662b7

5f50f6b102e85708c8df0788,1,Ditto are a disappointment.,"I have been extremely disappointed by the service Ditto have provided over the past two years since I have been using them as my distributor. Although I have uploaded music months in advance of the release date, I have had two occasions where 1) The music was released after the release date and 2) The music said it was sent to stores when it had not been. With regards to their customer service, the 'support log ticket' system does not work. I am constantly sent to 'the page you are looking for does not exist' and although when I do occasionally manage to log a support ticket I have waited more than 72 hours for replies. I have received generic emails from service member teams who clearly have not read my problem properly. This is not always the case... but it is a gamble who ends up responding to your support ticket. I can only assume that customer service members are told to 'hit targets' which is why my problems are not read correctly and are answered with generic replies. I can also only assume that the music is checked according to release date rather than upload date. This means that  artists who upload their music months in advance so as to have the best chance at having their music heard for playlists end up being hurt the most as platforms such as Spotify do not receive the music in time despite the length it has been sitting with Ditto waiting to be sent to stores. What else can I say? They were pretty good 2 years ago when I started releasing with them, but have only gone downhill and are now between a rock and a hard place. I cannot see myself releasing with them again in the future. I just hope that my most recent release, which I've paid more money for just in the sheer hope it actually gets to the platforms on time, does actually make it there. That's all I can assume - the more money you throw at them, the more likely chance you have at seeing your music released on time.",2020-09-03T13:59:13.000Z,"September 03, 2020",Rachel ,1,GB,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/5f50f6b102e85708c8df0788,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5f50f68b6d611475dd9d6ebf

I've lost money and time to this and got nothing in return but stress.Full review:I released an album as part of a band without too much trouble under a different account and found the service to be pretty straight forward to use. However, I have recently tried to release music on another artist page, paid for the artist account and scheduled my first release. I then tried to release two more singles, however, neither let me select the ""unlimited"" plan I've paid for.It gets worse.I sent a ticket 5 days ago and haven't had a response despite adding updates with each other issue I've encountered (yes there's more). So remember the first single? I received an email 2 days ago stating that the first track I uploaded for release has an issue, so can't be sent off. It said this issue was due to the artwork not being up to spec/being corrupted and as I created the artwork TO the Ditto specs, I just re-uploaded. When trying to ""repair"" the release though, I get stuck on the same page as my other unreleased tracks: Select Your Plan. I cannot select the plan I have paid for on ANY of my tracks, meaning I can't release any of my music. I wonder if this part of the site is just down in some way and there aren't the staff to fix it due to the virus, or if I've just been scammed.

I haven’t been able to withdraw my royalities since May so I raised a ticket.  In the past this was no issue when it occurred and it was cleared within a few days.  I received an email that they were backed up, but would get to my issue as soon as they could.  Next thing I know I’m locked out of my account with no access to my releases or royalties.  I emailed about this problem and have yet to hear back.  According to other reviews I will be waiting for a response that will accuse me of streaming fraud so they can justify their criminal behavior.  I believe they are stealing from clients.  If you have this same issue,  I encourage you to file a complaint with the UK government so they can investigate Ditto Music because this company is a complete fraud.  Just use Tunecore, they would never do something like this.I’m not allowed to leave a link in this review, but just google “UK Complain about a limited company”And you should see the government link, should be the first to pop up.  Good luck and don’t give up on your dreams.UPDATE:  Ditto did respond and accuse me of ‘artificial streaming’.  When I asked for them to provide the claim they mentioned they received from a store they made an excuse that support has no access to claims.  It was all very vague and clearly a lie.  I entertained their accusation and provided proof of streaming activity (non of it extraordinary or abnormal), they responded and said thank you for providing the information.  Here we are months later and I am still locked out of the account with no access to my releases or royalties.  They are 100 percent stealing people’s masters and royalties.  Do not use this company.

The album artwork was rejected because it contained ""imagery"", I had to settle for the artist name and that was it.FINALLY, I got my album approved and distributed.

I decided to withdraw my royalties AND then I could not log into my dittomusic account.  This was extremely frustrating.  My first thought was I had been hacked.  I sent an email and a few days later, they informed me that my account was under review for illegal streaming.   They asked me to provide them with receipts, websites, and playlists that were used.  I had nothing, since I never used a third party to promote my music, it was literally a handful of text messages to friends and family members.

I bought a Ditto Promo package (thankfully when it was on sale) for my most recent release for £250 (instead of £500). Here is what their 'marketing expertise' was able to give me:- 2 'online features' (basically in two low quality online spam-mags that anyone could contact and get content posted on - the better of which I had actually contacted myself too, so it's dubious whether Ditto or I sealed the deal) - their 'industry contact database' -  (which I'm happy to provide to anyone) is just a list of blog website addresses - no contact details at all- some basic info about social media posting schedules- some sub-par images which I didn't use- an instagram advert which had zero impact on my campaignSo then people will think that it's prob crap music I asked them to promote. Well... away from Ditto under my own steam, I was able to get:- Multiple blog features (around 18 at the moment in good blogs)- A very high quality blog premiere for my video- National press coverage- A record deal- International radio playSo... if you're thinking of hiring Ditto because you don't think you can do this yourself. Honestly, 15 mins on the internet yourself will give you better results and better info than what they will provide for £250/£500. Even better still, ask around if anyone you know knows a PR person who is just starting or up and coming. Your £250 will buy you a dedicated PR person who will care about your music and who will do their best for you, rather than just do some crappy mail-shot to a poor quality list. Staff were polite, but that means nothing if the outcome is so appalingly poor. Going on the reviews here already, this is just standard practice for Ditto.As for distribution, I use Emu Bands and have never had any problems with delays etc. And am not tied to a poor company like Ditto for the rest of my career (that's what you're doing when you sign to Ditto).So there you go. Feel free to contact me at steadywavesuk on facebook and I'll pass on the 'industry contact database' any answer any questions.EDIT: Just found out that Ditto actually paid for the 'blog' coverage for the spam-rags that they got me 'features' in.

I am basically not allowed to make a full withdraw of all my earnings. All of my releases are fully verified, active and original and I haven't received any warnings or information about the current distraint. Thus, I decided to file a ticket, which upon posting went... nowhere. I briefly got a message saying ""We are currently experiencing a high volume of support requests. Please be patient while we resolve your issue."", then checked my active tickets - NOTHING. Did it a couple of times in the span of a week, maybe. I searched for other electronic means of contacting Dittomusic - there are none. Tried a UK based phone number - disconnected. Now I tried to post a ticket and it finally had the luck to appear in my active tickets, but it is long overdue. I literally have no idea what have I breached, no guidance on how to fix it, if there actually is something that I have done or not.

5f2591141a5a6907a4787030,1,Dittomusic is a criminal enterprise. Beware!,"Dittomusic is a criminal enterprise. They will break the law and take your money. Here is my detailed story:1. Usually, earning reports are available three months after the actual month in which the songs were streamed. So I uploaded my songs to Dittomusic, waited three months and then wanted to access my money. In order to do so, they required following information from me, which had not previously been specified in the terms of use: A copy of my ID and a video of me, scanning my biometric data. First of all, this alone is highly suspicious: No other company requires biometric data, and the need to provide these will be communicated to you only once you request your money. It is likely that your data will be used for criminal schemes.2. Nevertheless, I provided the data and was actually able to withdraw money, which initially surprised me. The fact that I needed to provide biometric data scared me off nevertheless and I did some research, seeing that the reviews on trustpilot had suddenly plummeted, and finding a horrible Dittomusic review on YouTube (Check out Steve Freeman's review). So I canceled my subscription. As my music had been uploaded for three months, and I had only been payed for one, Dittomusic still owed me money for the next two months. I was entitled to these profits, as specified in the terms of use. But when the second month was over, there were no earnings shown - zero. I wrote the support. They stated I had the option to resubscribe (and pay again) and access the correct report or wait a few months until they would have a look at my earnings. I chose to resubscribe. Once I did that, I saw the correct earning report, but STILL was unable to actually access my money.3. When I wrote the support that I couldn't access my money, they said that their licensing team had to have a look at my songs before payout, to make sure I owed all corresponding rights. This argumentation is COMPLETELY INVALID, as Dittomusic had already payed me the month before for the same music. If they really would check the licensing before payout, they would have already done so. Besides this, there were no information provided how this 'check for verification' was allegedly carried out. At this point, it was likely that those simply were empty words in order to come up with a reason to scam me and take my money.4. Then, suddenly, I was unable to log into my account - without any notice whatsoever. Not only did Dittomusic break their terms of use by withholding my money without reason, they also withheld their service from me, for which I still was paying - which means that Dittomusic broke the law. When I wrote them again, they accused me of steaming fraud, without providing any evidence, and asked me to provide evidence that prooved my innocence. Legally, a shifting of the burden of proof is unjustified. Now it was obvious, that Dittomusic's operation of business is to take their customers money, then accuse them of steaming fraud and hope that the customers can not afford a lawyer. I canceled my subscription again and was never paid.5. According to this operation of business, it is obvious that Dittomusic is a criminal enterprise. They still owe me money and I demand them to pay me.6. All these 5 star ratings on Trustpilot seem to come in a cicle of a few months, once a lot of 1 star reviews have been gathered. I assume those are fake reviews by Dittomusic itself.Summary: NEVER EVER EVER USE DITTOMUSIC!

I've started working with Ditto two years ago when I published my first written song, Unspoken Love. Always wanted to have a song released but seemed beyond my understanding how that works. With Ditto it all seemed easy, it was straight-forward, they always came back to me with information if I requested any, overall a great experience.

5f19d3441a5a69071c94180c,2,I had very high hopes for Ditto and they blew it.,"TL;DR - Your releases may not come out on time and you won't get any indication why for days. Customer service is bottom of the barrel, unresponsive and not helpful. Best you can hope for from them is a half apology on twitter. I had very high hopes for Ditto, and after reading lots of reviews (and admittedly ignoring the negative ones about their customer service) I gave them a shot. I give them two stars because when everything works fine, they do deliver, but when things go wrong...well, let me tell you the story of our most recent release.1) They changed how many days you have to submit music without notifying us. I had to change all of my artists' entire release schedules because we were ready to submit 11 days before (the cutoff used to be 10 days before release), but they changed it to 14 days overnight. For a small label this is quite inconvenient because we can only dedicate so many resources to a given release at a given time, and thus we schedule things quite specifically.2) We bought the chartbreaker package for this specific release. This is where things really started going downhill. Once the new release date was decided, the track was uploaded to the platform and the chartbreaker package was applied, everything looked normal. We get closer to the release date and there's no confirmation of the chart registration and no pre-release has happened. Come release day THE TRACK ISN'T ON STORES. I check the account again and it still says ""Processing"" as opposed to ""Sent to Stores"". I send in a support ticket and tweet at them to find out what's going on. Two days without a response to my multiple messages, and then I get a weak apology saying that ""it appears that it encountered an error upon delivery"". At no point was I ever notified that there was an issue. I have now been battling for over 2 weeks to get a refund for the chartbreaker package. After back and forth and waiting 9 days for a response, they've now come back to say they'll give me a partial refund for the pre-release. The track was released in dribs and drabs to the various services 7-12 days late.Whether I get any money back or not remains to be seen, but the fact of the matter is that my release did not come out on time and nobody at Ditto seemed to care. I could have forgiven the lack of pre-release, no confirmation of registration for charts or social graphics being made, but the fact that they couldn't even get my release out on time with a two-week buffer and no feedback really gets to me. My company looked like fools to the artists that entrusted us with their release. This doesn't even include my experience trying to get the deliverables from the Ditto Promo Package for a previous release. Suffice to say, I'm getting ready to take my money elsewhere. All of our releases will move off the platform and we won't employ their other services henceforth. This probably would never have happened to any of their artists with high streams that bring in a lot of attention. But for the smaller companies and artists growing your following, I highly recommend you take your money elsewhere to a company that'll actually care about you and your projects. I hope you don't have to learn the lesson the painful way.On a positive note, The CEO is fun to chat with on Twitter when talking about new features or things you'd like to see them do. Shame that none of these new features have come to fruition yet and that he completely disappears when the company is not doing what you're paying it to do.",2020-07-23T18:13:24.000Z,"July 23, 2020",Tumi Lengoasa,1,ZA,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/5f19d3441a5a69071c94180c,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5f19d32c6b921fd51fc0ca67

5f1009cc3f06f20bb4b40a89,4,Give it a try - you won’t be disappointed.,"When I first signed up for Ditto, I wasn’t sure what to expect as there wasn’t a great deal of information out there about other people’s experiences with the service. Having been signed up since late last year, I’ve been pretty happy with the service so, although there have been/ are a few minor things that I think should be improved. The service has been reliable (I think one scheduled release date has been missed, which was then expedited and sorted within a few days), and the customer service has been helpful in sorting out my profile for many of the platforms (if you have the same/ similar name to an existing artist, you can end up with your music attached to someone else’s - this was sorted out pretty quickly and easily by the customer service staff).A couple of points that could be better:1- They should change the message that you will hear back in 24-48 hours when you contact customer services - it’s nearly always longer than this. 2- Allow artists to request an early upload (for submission to Spotify playlists) from within the upload process - currently I the only way to do this is to message customer services and ask for it. 3- Automatically start a new artist profile for new artists - it l would just be easier to merge a couple of profiles if needed, rather than listing the songs and giving details for each platform. Overall, I would recommend Ditto to anyone looking at self-distributing their music - they provide a great service at a great price!Additionally, I’ve noticed lately that there is a 90 day free trial to the service too, so you can see for yourself!",2020-07-16T08:03:24.000Z,"July 16, 2020",Andrew,2,GB,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/5f1009cc3f06f20bb4b40a89,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5f1009b50f0f843431fc9d25

From April 11th to May 4th is a total of 23 damn days! I inquired on the 22nd WHY my release wasn't submitted yet, and they didn't respond until the 29th to basically say ""oops, our bad we forgot"" WHICH IS VERY COMMON FOR THESE dum dums! The release was NOT sent to the stores until 3 days ago. So you're company is a lie. It does not take up to 10 days it takes you up to 20 days to release a song. HALF a** at that! I'm disgusted with you jerks! This will be the last time I ever release my music through this bogus company. No matter how early I submit you repeatedly ruin my releases so give me all of my info so I can transfer everything to a real distributor and I'll be transferring all of my music cashing out my accounts and deleting all traces of this relationship before the year is up.

5ea5e10e086b64095440d1a8,1,COPYRIGHT BREACH & TERRIBLE PR CAMPAIGN,"Hello,I was recently looking for a distributor to supply my first ep entering the music industry. I chose Ditto because they had advertised to have worked with the likes of Ed Sheeran, Stormzy, and Sam Smith, so I considered them reputable.I purchased RLIAB package for $750-$800, all was good, when my ep was mastered I sent it to for distribution. I paid $499 for the pr campaign, cause it seemed enticing at first. It promised to provide 3 artworks/3video promo's, a pr guide list calendar, a social media post calendar guide catered specifically for your brand, and 2 blog post made about you. What I received was the pr guide list calendar (template) , and the social media calendar which was also a template and on it they didnt bother changing the previous customer artists name, in stead of ""Nemo"" ( me ) , they used Swerve. Anyway I ignored that, and as it came 3days till release I didnt have much time I started emailing them asking whats going on and got no reply so 48hrs before my release I decided to pull the plug and ask for a refund because they didnt deliver what they promised. They forwarded my paypal account a refund and said I should receive it in 2-3days (which is tomorrow) .WAIT, IT GETS WORSE! SO AFTER WASTING MY TIME I STARTED TO INVEST BIG MONEY INTO MY OWN ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN PRE RELEASE HOPING I CAN GET A BOOST WITHIN THE NEXT 48HRS. AND WHEN THE RELEASE CAME, THE WORST NEWS HAPPENED. KEEP IN MIND THIS IS MY FIRST EVER EP... DITTO ATTACHED MY TRACK TO ANOTHER ARTIST NAMED NEMO, TO ALLLLLL MUSIC PROVIDERS. WHAT A COMPLETE MESS UP.  SO NOW IM COMPLETELY SCREWED BECAUSE 1. I ADVERTISED A TON OF MONEY AND 2. THE RELEASE ISNT EVEN ON ATTACHED ON MY NAME. PLUS THEY DIDNT RELEASE IT ON BEATPORT LIKE IT WAS ADVERTISED ON THEIR WEBSITE....

So i thought there was a Bug in the system and i waited for a day. One day later... Nothing happened. So i sent them an email since i cannot log a Ticket because i cant access my account. Their reply was, that there had been some fishy activity from my account and that my account is under investigation and that i would not have access to my account until they finish the investigation. They had not given me what sort of investigation are they undergoing and what is the reason, they refuse to pay me my ROYALTIES and They refuse to Reply to any of my inquiries and e-mails! They also haven't even paid me back my Subscription. My Conclusion: Don't ever use these scammers. Their behaviour resembles an addicted crack user who just wants to steal people's money to carry on!

Go professional For £19.99 per year, you can release as many singles, EP's and albums as you can create straight from your home studio in a few clicks. Ditto deliver your music straight to the shelves of all good online music stores including i-tunes, amazon, spotify (and beatport, if like me you primarily produce dance music). It's super easy to use, they collect & (you keep 100%) of any royalties you make & your metadata gets embedded into your music along with the internationally recognised publishing catalogue codes they issue on your behalf, also useful for later on when your next iconic release gets picked up by the music sync supervisors over at Netflix. Ditto have been in the game for years and broke acts like Ed Sheeran to the market, they have millions in revenues paid out to thousands of artists and they can also help your budding career out with comprehensive PR and publicity packages, modestly priced and guaranteed to get you real exposure.I'd tried different ways of releasing my music previously before Ditto, but with mixed results; inadvertent take downs, recurring hosting fees and ""Horror"".. bad mp3 encoding (no names mentioned.)Ditto Music have a great, responsive support team and ticketing process for urgent requests and they have lots of good FREE advice for unsigned bands too. I've actually got a release coming out tomorrow through Ditto Music. It's my very first ever re-mix track and it will be up and out there when I wake up in the morning. EXCITING !  I've also got a twin album release coming up for spring 2020 (currently working my way through 18 mixdowns !) and I'm seriously considering Ditto Music's Chartbreaker package to break my music out to a whole new audience. It includes Pre-Release, Chart Registration, Social Media Graphics, Press Release Builder, PR Guide & Contact Database.   Check them out... if you're an independent label, you can also release & manage as much music content from multiple artists from as little as £29.99 per year.

5dfedd9cc845450b68e5a9b5,1,Absolute trash service,"Absolute trash service. Matt and Lee Parson are some of the most unprofessional leaders in the music business. For those who are on the fence due to the 64% positive reviews rest assured that those reviews are either by people who just started out or bought and that these lengthy negative reviews are worth a hundred of the positive vague and short ones. I released my song on October 26th. I initiated the distribution on October 5th. Three weeks passed and i saw that the song was up on Spotify, Deezer, Apple Music, Shazam and Pandora. All the other stores don't seem to have this song available. That's problem number 1. But it turns out that i needed to take down my song because i wasn't getting good feedback for it. So I submitted 3 tickets, one in November two in December, all 3 were ignored. I had to manually go to every store's website and request the takedown personally through their own customer service. I don't want to mention the terrible problems they have regarding withholding funds from other Artists as my friend had to go through. Ditto is using spikes in streaming to justify withholding funds from others. By claiming that there may be ""suspicious"" activity going on with your account they can effectively stop you from having any control over your money. So to put it in perspective of how absolute trash Ditto's customer service is. I had an easier time taking down my songs through 44 customer services, each of different busy websites than Ditto's. This is not a joke and should serve to be a red flag. Oh and they do respond to emails when it has something to do with payment. You paying something to them that is forget any responses of a refund.Infact a ""refund"" is an inconceivable thing to Ditto and doesn't really exist despite it being an ""option"" Its like an alien word to them. Here is a video detailing one terrible experience a YouTuber had with Ditto music: watch?v=p1RGVLeAjD0""But Ed Sheeran and Chance The Rapper have used Ditto"" and guess what buddy, they do not in any way shape or form use Ditto anymore or even suggest using it at all. Ditto flail their names around but you don't see the opposite happening because if they had any respect for their artists they would have people like Sheeran and Chance respect them, but you don't see Ed Sheeran or Chance the rapper support this company at all and that's because this company has been embroiled in too much controversy that never worked in favour of their reputation.If this isn't enough to convince you to stay the hell away from Ditto then i'll leave this as my final try.

They tried to hide royalties from me from week one of my release. Sending support tickets gets ignored time after time. You may get a response if you email them directly but that's where the 'fun' starts. They constantly contradict themselves and LIE to you. It's BEYOND frustrating.I have basically been called a liar from one of their support staff 'Jen'. They refuse to answer a simple question, dodging and dancing around the issue, then CLOSED the ticket before the issue was resolved because I was asking questions they didn't want to answer!!!Previously they added me to a load of streaming services without my permission or knowledge. This meant people were streaming my album for free instead of buying the album. You get pretty much nothing for streaming so I have lost money because of this. I found out I had been put on Apple music and trying to get them to take it off took over TWO MONTHS. Support at Ditto is an absolute joke. A shambles. DELIBERATELY INCOMPETENT I suspect..Having had enough of Ditto, I wanted to go to someone else to host my album. You have to get your album taken down from Ditto before you can do this. I requested a takedown of my album which was initially ignored! It seems if you make a request which doesn't benefit THEM, they will ignore you, drag their heels and won't let you go. It took about FOUR MONTHS for this to be completed. They blamed Amazon, so I went to Amazon and they blamed Ditto. What a mess! There is NO PHONE NUMBER on their site. You cannot call them and speak to an actual person. All the phone numbers I found online didn't work. I wonder why? That should set off red flags right there.Any positive reviews are probably from people who haven’t had to send a support ticket, one review I read was someone who gave them five stars, then admitted that they'd never actually released anything from Ditto! REALLY??!!  OR they are sock accounts from Ditto themselves as some sort of damage control because of all the terrible reviews they get. Just look at the six 5 star reviews below mine, they where all submitted on THE SAME DAY. BS!! They really are TERRIBLE.

Its a 50/50 on whether it will ever get taken down. Valid WAV files get rejected for being 'corrupt' when they worked fine before. (And remember, they don't tell you that until the day before release...)Honestly a joke of a service, and an absolute nightmare for releasing music.

Last year a couple of my albums went off Sptofify, now I'm not a famous artist so I didn't even notice until a fan informed me. I emailed Ditto and was told there had been a change and to send everything again, no apology. So I sent everything again, 3 months, multiple emails, twitter contact, contact forms later I had no replies. Finally someone at Ditto got back in touch, again no apology just telling me to send my music and artwork again, which I did and again I was ignored. I'm sure that a big artist would not put up with this sort of neglect which led me to conclude that Ditto is no longer for independent artists.

5c79a67697afa10ad4bf7855,1,Totally dropped the ball on my release,"Totally dropped the ball on my release. I uploaded my files and placed my order on January 24th for a release date of March 1st. I was told on Feb 28, the DAY BEFORE my release date, that there were problems with my uploads that I needed to fix, so I promptly went to address the issues and found that the error message did not apply to what I had put up. So I resubmitted and logged a support request for them to fix the glitch and put the order through on time, given that I had uploaded my files over a month prior and planned ALL of my promotion around a date of March 1st. More than 36 hours have now passed without any response whatever and in the meantime, the release threw up the same error again. Given this unresponsiveness from customer service ON my official release day, I logged a support request asking them to cancel the order and I purchased distribution with new barcodes from CDBaby, which I know to be a reliable and responsive company. As a result of this computer glitch combined with their total unresponsiveness, my release is going to be 1-2 weeks late to all the streaming platforms and all the promotion I have set up has been seriously compromised if not rendered totally ineffective. Who goes to YouTube or SoundCloud? They will check Spotify, be unable to find it, and will forget completely about my album. I am seriously angry about this experience. A distributor has exactly ONE JOB and that is to get the product to the stores by the date agreed. I will be taking all my business elsewhere in the future and I suggest you do so as well.EDIT: They finally sent me an email on the morning of March 3rd explaining that I was at fault. And also, the reason they gave for my submission not working -- that there was something wrong with the title format -- was simply untrue, since the exact same titles and tracks had already been delivered to stores by CDBaby at that point. Absolutely brilliant. I responded that they had had four weeks to inspect my tracks and deliver them to stores in advance of my release date, and that this represented sheer incompetence on their part. Do the math. In the same amount of time it took Ditto simply to respond to my initial email, CDBaby had already inspected, approved, and delivered my album to every platform that matters and it was live about 24 hours later, everywhere but Apple, which was a pleasant surprise given my expected timeline of up to 2 weeks' delay.

5c51b42d97afa109dcf23ff8,4,Honest review by a label manager,"We're a small label that works with DITTO's label package and we must admit that we've hesitated to start our partnership because of the mixed reviews we found online. So here's our experience with Ditto Music:* Customer Service *After about a month of working together everything has worked out fine, the releases were all on time and the customer service was sufficient (a bit more short and to the point compared to other aggregators but hey, they're doing their job well so no complaints here). They also tend to send emails with useful tips and interviews with industry people on a regular basis.* Platform & DSPs *The platform you use to submit music is very user-friendly and the DSPs they offer are broad anough for artists in most regions of the world, except Asia (no options for QQ Music, etc.).* Beatport distribution *The fact that they offer Beatport distribution is definitely a plus and it works like a charm, we've tried it on one release. Be aware of the fact that Beatport might upload it in the evening if you're living in West Europe.* Express release service *We had to use their 'Express' release service for a spontaneous release of one of our hip hop artists that was getting a lot of media attention during that time. The track released on iTunes the same day (on a Saturday!) and Spotify was up and running on Monday morning.* Analytics and royalty payments *The Analytics system seems to be working quite well, we can only see a few DSPs for now though. But unfortunately we can't give any thorough feedback on these aspects as we're only using DITTO for about a month now. We did notice that some people had issues with it. Hopefully we can come back in a few months and give some more info on these topics.",2019-01-30T14:34:11.000Z,"January 30, 2019",Raf C,1,BE,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/5c51b42d97afa109dcf23ff8,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5c51b42bb364c2b9be51f56e

First I have used Ditto for our last few releases with my current band and my previous band. The service is always excellent in getting your music out there on most platforms; however, there at times have been small delays with sites such as Spotify not getting for a few days after other stores like iTunes and google. That being said I have friends who have released on other platforms and lost revenue from sites like youtube, while Ditto actually gave us royalties from content ID which is a nice plus. Naturally being curious I have double checked and found my music in most stores except Pandora, although it has been found even on somewhat obscure places so no harm no foul there. All that being said ditto has been very good and making sure we get our money and has always been very responsive. My only true complaint has been the sales tab does not always reflect sales so there is not a true way to gauge sales on every platform until the report actually shows up which can take quite some time.so here's an easy list of pros and consPro's: easy to use, you do get your money, relatively cheapcon's: the dashboard is ""ok"" at best, if your like me(from America) all the money is not listed in dollars which can be annoying, the sales report can take forever (which is more on the stores than Ditto itself)so would I Recommend this serviceYes I would",2019-01-24T22:41:30.000Z,"January 24, 2019",Trent Johnson,2,US,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/5c4a3f1a97afa10bf071ec94,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5c4a3f11259e19da1a8a3c99

Let's face it, most of us here are just little fish swimming round our little fishbowls looking out at the world with our little fishy fins kind of flapping but not really sure where to go or how to get there. :D. Swimming around our little bowls, wondering about the who's, what's where's and how's.  Yeah you've got some music you want people to hear.  Recorded a few covers or written your own songs and have done the best to invest what you have to make as nicer recording of it as possible. It's ready to go and you're searching for the best way to get folks to hear your music. You know some technical stuff and have googled and read reviews and reports on different companies and different products... I know I was there 3 years ago. After careful consideration of all the reviews and reports I found I chose Ditto because it's products suited my requirements at the time. Basically I needed to learn what was going on and get things moving, get invested so I had a vested interest in the world of ONLINE music distribution. I gave my little tail a swish and made the call and from that moment on Ditto stepped up to the plate and everyone involved got to work on my music. I'm just one little fish, one little fish of us many little fishes and they made me feel like a very special little fish. I felt that it was as equally important to them as it was to me for my music to not only be distributed out into the digital world of online shopping but also to presented in the besterest possible way to help attract the eye of folks who would enjoy listening to my music. It's quite simple really, they are professionals at what they do and they do it well. Each step of the way, as daunting as it seemed to me was a breeze for them.. From the generating of social media followers and reaching out to a real online audience to the presentations of promotional posts and music reviews the team was brilliant. Jobs got done and , well results happened. In the first promotional package I used a number of new followers made contact, bought my music online and I even made some great fans um friends I mean fans who are now friends who I still chat with about the music side of life. An invitation or two to go and collaborate with some very cool musos on the other side of the planet.. Seriously, I'm still a little fish because its such a great big ocean out there.. I love making music and having folks enjoying my tunes and I know that if it weren't for the Ditto team being as professional and nurturing and caring and all those good things, then well I'd still be sitting in my little fish bowl flapping my little fishy fins just wondering which way to go. I've given five stars on this recommendation, not because I would recommend this company, but because I do recommend it.

I feel that by abandoning any other form of payment method without telling us customers Ditto have sold us a little short. We now have to pay a third party AND give said third party our personal details in order for them to take money off our hard earned royalties and sales. There doesn't appear to be any continuity between the payment threshold Ditto suggests and Payoneer suggest. I dearly wish they'd not stopped use of the old payment systems of Paypal or BACS. - They used to have a phone number to deal with customer service issues but got rid of it and I wish they hadn't. Coordinating release dates and promo and radio pushes and everything else is tough and sometimes requires urgent resolution of previously unforeseen issues no matter how well you plan things. Having someone on the end of a line wouldn't hurt too much.- I had an issue using one of their promo packages and confusion over US/UK month/day vs day/month detailing. This ultimately lead to me cancelling the service but I received a full refund and their apologies.- The website works fine enough for single track releases but uploading WAV files for album or even EP releases can be a nightmare and last time required me to send the files via WeTransfer to Ditto directly.The one big pro i'd say is the subscription service. I've really liked the capacity to spontaneously release single tracks across online distributors and streaming services throughout the year.

Apparently, you are not allowed any text on the cover artwork! This includes text such as ""Music By"" / ""Vocals By"" / ""Lyrics By"" or even the record label name!

Don't believe these 5 stars rating, they are written probably by ditto itself..Let me start with my experience. For first, i waited two and half week for my first release! It was just a single.. one single, didnt even have 2 minutes length.. But ok, let's say this is understandable, they must create profile on every platform and so on... But what happened to mne next got me fxcked up..,I tried to release my first long length project on ditto, got like 7 tracks. I was in rush and needed to release that fast. After two days they postponed my release and said it requires repair.. why? As I saw in many releases on spotify and apple music, name of the artist is mentioned in the name of the tittle like  ""PICK IT UP (feat. A$AP Rocky)"".. This is basic and really popular thing to do, because featuring artists are just written with small letters under the track and this give them more attention and credit.. But when i did this too, they postponed my records and don't want to release it :)) I sent them plenty of record titles that are made like this, wanted to show them streaming platforms got no problems with this.. no reaction. I was really in rush, so just edited it because of their unnecessary rules.. felt bad for my featuring artist but what else could I do.. and at end of the email they wrote me: ""You got 14 days to fix your record to be right, otherwise YOU WILL PAY FOR CHANGES"". WHAT?? PAY THE FINE JUST BECAUSE MY RECORD IS LIKE THOUSANDS OF OTHER RECORDS AND NOBODY GOT PROBLEM WITH THAT? If you think that was not enough.. after two days they striked again..Another suspension because:""NO ADDITIONAL TEXT on artwork other than the artist name & release title""You F kidding me??? I just got my favourite outfit on myself and logo of fashion brand ""supreme"" was seen on the cover.. I was in rush and really hopeless.. THOUSANDS OF RELEASES, especially rap artists is dressed on cover to  Supreme, Gucci, LV... And why they didn't say this after two days already and waited two more days??? I must because of this ""rule"" made another cover and watch out because of ""NO ADDITIONAL TEXT"" on the building, on clothes, on the car in the background... Just can't understand how company like this won't release a record just becasue is on the cover written something else than my name and name of the tittle..This is  unacceptable experience, please artists never use this platform..

The EP's went Live but the name WAS CHANGED! for all releases. ! so the music i was entrusted to produce and distribute, has now been put out in all stores under the wrong name. other artist music released under the wrong name !!  ! this is completely unacceptable. I don't even know how this could happen! it was completely obvious they were by a different artist. I was never notified of a change to my release artist name. or that there was a problem with the name. a name i had confirmed already was fine. Ditto then tried to tell me this was my fault. and that i hadn't created a release artist. even after i provided screenshots of the scheduled releases under the correct plan artist name.  They then claimed again that i had not set this as a my plan artist. when screenshots clearly show this is not the case.i was offered no explanation other than being told to do exactly what i already did in the first place. and incorrectly told serval times that i had not created the plan artist. so basically it was my fault.! even after screenshots prove this nonsense. so frustratedly i had to ask for a refund as I seemed to have no other option. and ditto certainly didn't care about the fact they just botched a release for four different artists. I was promised a refund and told it was being processed 14 days ago now. as of today. still no refund. this is just ridiculous.! i actually wanted nothing but to remain a customer and have the release sorted out. instead. months later. i have no release in stores. and i am still waiting for a refund. everything about my customer service has been impersonal and infective. right down to being told a refund was being proceeded. a complete unacceptable shambles. stay away. !!update: dittomuisc have now escalated my dispute to a claim on PayPal meaning i presume they are trying not to refund me. i hope i can provide the documented evidence to paypal to prove my case.",2018-04-26T14:17:10.000Z,"April 25, 2018",Home Concerts - 'Live Music',3,GB,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/5ae03f586d33bc09284ac141,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5ae03d924de5666d34b378ad

Support tickets take generally between 2 & 5 days to get a reply to. They have no phone line so you have no choice but send a ticket to them online and wait for a reply which tends to be half arsed to which you then have to respond to and go through the whole wait again.2. I like many others have experienced a really bad time getting my music released on the day its supposed to. Its constantly raising tickets on the day of a release and chasing and badgering and then eventually you probably get your music released a day or two late which is really really unprofessional.a 5 minute scan of peoples interactions on twitter will show you how many people are having release issues with these guys.their fee structure is good granted but you get what you pay for. its a cheap price but the service you receive is cheap and you end up losing out on music sales because of the way they act, and worse still as an artist or label you look unprofessional for promoting a track release only for it not to be released.I had to chase my beatport release for a week before they finally got it released a week late and then what did they do ? yep they buried it with the original release date meaning my track disapeared behind hundreds of other tracks and automatically became unavailable in the 7 day filter for any weekly shoppers. Essentially the track was never shown as a new release at all.Shambolic service, Once my subscription ends I will be leaving immediately.Honestly find another aggregation service to use paying a bit extra.

I spoke to the girl over two emails she sent out standard replies and she offered graphic design.  I asked her to help with the graphic for my logo guess what she said.. 'we don't do that, but I'll ask'... Lol...13.

After explaining what happened over 4 long emails which I didn't have time for guess what they put two of my songs up guess how many listens they got 17 plays in 4 months.  I think they have a real playlist that gets a lot of listeners and one that just shuts people up. w14. What a fraud, they are borderline illegal activity but guess what who's gonna audit them.

5a0c7487fc7e9b0048ad5100,1,Take The Time To Read This Unbiased Review...,"I don't even know where to start with how diabolical this company is and I really don't know how they are still operating.We've had nothing but trouble with every single release we tried to push out through them. Things ranging from placing a release for a jazz artists where we specified ""Jazz"" genre and it being push out under ""Rock & Metal"" to pricing being total different to what we set and it not even appearing on some outlets.Let's summarise problems you will probably get when using Ditto...SupportOk so you used to be able to call them up... Oh No Not Any More! Now you have to fill out an online ticketing system to submit a support request. It says you will be responded to within 48 hours. Want to know how long it took us to get a response? 1 WEEK!!!!...and do you know how we got that response? We had to go on Twitter and broadcast the problem that there was no response as well as email the Managing Director. 2 weeks on and they are ""still trying"" to sort out the problem which is a ""system issue"".Web SiteWhere do we start with the web site. If you have all day I could wax lyrical about all the issues suffice as to say it is the biggest pile of cow dung you will come across. Considering all their business for releases is done through it I can't believe I repeatedly get told ""Yep we know about that problem"" and ""Yep you need to try a different web browser or device"".On one occasion I logged into the web site and the debug tools tab for their developers was actually live for me to be able to look at what was going on with all the server processes and databases. Total gold mine for any hacker that would want to gain access to your personal information.Most of the time you will get at least one malformed page per visit where it will show you the source code where the page displays incorrectly and you have to hit refresh.Vevo VideosThe Vevo video uploads section is screwed and they know about it and so the only way to resolve this is to Dropbox them the video and email all the information so it manually gets uploaded. (This by the way you only find out when you submit, after having completed all the information and waited for your video to upload to their server).You can't edit anything and if you create a video and then try to delete the set up you were going through you have no chance. It just sits there holding its head in shame. It's normally called something like ""Null"" as the video title.Missing OutletsDon't count on getting your release pushed to all the outlets that you specify. It's pretty much pot luck as to what you get and certainly don't think this service will be useable if you want to use a mix of artists. We paid for the ""Ditto DJ"" subscription which would allow us to push certain artists to Beatport and a couple of other EDM specific outlets on top of the usual indie/pop etc we needed for other artists. To date we have not successful achieved this (even though they are legal remixes of our own artists) by world renowned DJ's.Also if you have the Beatport service there is a bug in the site where you have to go to step 4 of the process and then head back to step 1 after you have saved step 4, saying you don't want to use Beatport as this part will over write any settings you had for Genre on step 1. Those crazy kids at Ditto having all these fun and games with us ;)PricingHo ho ho. Now this is the fun part. There is no consistency between what anyone says on the help desk, what you request when you submit the release and what you actually get.So we pushed a single out with an A/B at 99p each. That went well as we were hoping and launched with 99p per track. We then pushed an EP. The EP consisted of 4 tracks and we had set each track at 99p. Want to know how it got released once Ditto pushed it? I'll tell you... Amazon at £14.99 iTunes at £9.99 Google £5.29So we got told by the help desk (a week and a half after submitting the problem) that Google charge more which is a crock of cak as we had previously pushed other stuff out at 99p which is the price we set. Also apparently as one of the tracks was over 10 minutes (DJ Remix of the original) the outlets treat it as an album. Are you kidding me???No where do they explain this and honestly if this was the case, why is it not advised to you when uploading? It seems like a pretty major point that should be noted. Add to this that one of the tracks on the EP is only available to download if you buy the album itself (we never asked or set this option and incidentally were advised this option was not available on Ditto when we enquired previously) so this means you can get 3 tracks for 99p each by buying them individually but if you want the 4th (the main remix) you have to spend £14.99 on Amazon to get it!Pre Release ServiceWe don't need no Pre Release Service.... well you'd better not need it as it doesn't work properly. When you push out a pre-release it doesn't work as they set random pricing (see above point) so what are the chances someone is going to pre-order a 4 track EP at £14.99???Text Message Pre Order ServiceWell this was a waste of money and we never got a refund. The whole idea of this was to be able to get people to text and purchase the song as a pre-order. Sounds like a great idea right? WRONG! You only got the information for it on the day of release so how were you meant to distribute it and get all those presales in? Nuff said on this. At least they have now withdrawn this service.Subscription RenewalSo you've used Ditto's service for a year? Time to renew the service? So as you'd expect the auto-renew doesn't work. You get downgraded to the ether and all of a sudden you don't have a record label on your portal. Ok I can handle having to go in and manually renew but hold on... what's this? The renew doesn't work... No it's not April Fools it's DITTO! So yep when you manually renew, all your label info has disappeared for any releases you have sitting there that you were preparing.Lets try and recreate the label again on the portal... do I really need to tell you what to expect? Yep you got it in one. You can add it again but it doesn't save any info. So now you have to go back to the help desk and submit another ticket... (switches computer off and gently backs away, sits in the corner of the room in the foetal position and sobs).In summary...All we wanted was a reliable service to push content. Nothing with bells and whistles and if we had a problems with that, then support to address/rectify the issues.Please don't think we are one of those awkward ones that starts issues for the hell of it. Far from it, we spent time our self trying to see if we could resolve it before getting in contact with support. They have admitted to the aforementioned bugs in their system and the MD has even been emailed screen grabs, OS version info, browser info, ISP connectivity info and debug info. I mean we have gone above and beyond to try and feedback on a technical level the problem we have experienced and be as helpful as we can. It was all a total waste.Ditto looks great and they tout their PR of it being an award winning service (years ago I might add for a bundled ""Record Label in a Box"" service ..hmm should have smelt a rat there).You can't polish a poo but they have just thrown buckets and buckets of glitter on it to try and make it seem appealing and disguise the fact it stinks.Trying to use Ditto's web service is like going outside in sub zero temperatures and standing in the snow for an hour in your underwear, then coming back in with hypothermia and trying to play a game of operation with a steady hand.Look at all the other Google reviews if you think we're being biased.Do yourself a favour and do a Google search for a more reputable service provider who delivers on their claims as my experiences have been long term and not a one off.",2017-11-15T17:08:23.000Z,"November 15, 2017",Grant Turner,53,GB,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/5a0c7487fc7e9b0048ad5100,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/590231e50000ff000a91e83c

I am the kind of person who likes to give credit where credit is due. I had a small issue with my release as well as a few questions about how Ditto operates. I spoke with a support person, Phil, who was able to easily resolve my issue and ease my mind. I have worked with other companies and for those complaining about lack of customer service from Ditto must have never used their competitors. Ditto BY FAR has the best customer support over both TuneCore and CDbaby. I actually logged a support ticket with TuneCore about 3 months ago to have my music removed and have yet to hear back. My only concern with Ditto is that their website is dated and the release builder is junky and just terrible overall. The release builder is very complicated and gives a lot of warnings if it appears you are putting information in incorrectly. Their website appears to work better with Google Chrome over Safari which is a shame considering how many musicians use Apple products.

When my followers gave honest 1 star reviews on there facebook, members of staff at ditto give themselves 5 star reviews to counter balance the numbers which I have screenshots of) So..What can I say that had not already been said in previous reviews?? Maybe a few things.. Upon the first album release attempt with them prices were wrong on every store. When I called up about this matter I was extremely dissapointed as you can imagine. Rather than try and help me they said its more conveniant for them to just delete my album!? Now thats customer service. That came from a manager. I wanted a copy of the call because of how I was spoken to and guess what? They do not record calls! funny that. Open game to speak to people how they want. That is not the reason for my review because they agreed to try and resolve this. Upon second release attempt yet again had pricing issues. I was told it was an error with the store. The store tells me to go to Ditto music as they arrange the prices.. Wow. Back and forward! Now the price bracket which was set was way off the prices they were making it! even on second and third attempts.. Then which really got my back up they for no reason at all changed the price on the only store that had the correct pricing! They changed it with no reason.. No word of warning.. It was just changed! They made it half the price it was. Its not only ruining my charity donations but also its just going to leave me out of pocket. Everything leading up to my release was on point with the press, bbc news and even a letter from Kensington palace recieving praise from Prince Harry. My release meant a lot to many people and because of all the problems I had to stop so many people purchasing it. I am not getting responses from my email either. Up to 24 hours it says? Been over a week. Because of this I can only be honest when the press want an update on my release. Which also means my supporters can only be honest on Trust Pilot when announcements get made of my current release. From looking at my release on the site it doesn't even look like they registered my release with charting which was also a service I paid for. Do yourself a favour and AVOID.

Obviously the first comments still apply for that period in time, but from now on, I hope not to have any further problems or I will be making further edits. I still think though that there should be a contact telephone number to speak to people and I don't like this email only option. It sends out the wrong signals to customers and I have expressed this view directly. It also will not change. I have now uprated from 1 star to 3 star and will monitor any further activities as more tracks are uploaded.I have listed three songs listed so far and the prices were wrong and varied from place to place. his has been partly corrected.Meanwhile, only one song is recognised when you search for it using the singers name and track title, so this in effect is useless. Just think of all the songs that cold contain the word 'love' or' rock' etc... This is basic data to say the least and should come up on any search via ITunes and amazon etc.... Only one of the three songs is correct and I had more to list!!!As for responding to emails, well!!!    -   we are now up to a month and with no reply despite being chased. I also notice that the telephone number has since been taken down off their webpage (well that's a surprise!!!) and to search for this on google, they now have a message telling you to email them which is a joke!.They are unprofessional to say the least and I even paid a premium for the one song to be listed.

58b8dacb864b170a54a657fe,5,Wonderful Distribution Service & Excellent Service From Ditto Australia!,"The Ditto site is user friendly, set up in a logical way and easy to navigate. Having one central point of contact for music distribution to such a wide variety of global retailers is very convenient for independent artists, it is an excellent service. One important improvement I could suggest is in the set up process, the site should warn you that as soon as you pay, your music and whatever artwork was loaded up, may be seen and heard on many digital retail sites within 24 hours – regardless of your future nominated release date. I pre loaded my songs and some mock artwork weeks in advance of the release date, while I waited for my CD’s to pressed. I then nominated a future release date and pre paid. I found that while the songs are not available to be purchased on these retail sites prior to your nominated Ditto release date, they will appear on many sites like Amazon, MediaNet and 7Digital, where the songs can be played as soon as you pay Ditto (within 24 hours). The artwork/image I loaded up (which was not the album cover), went straight out also - and it is a real effort to get the individual retailers to change the image/artwork that was pre loaded, to the actual album artwork you wish to display. That said, the service I received from the wonderful Sarah H in Ditto’s Melbourne, Australia office was truly exceptional. She was extremely knowledgeable and helpful over the phone on several occasions and very quick with her email responses. Sarah is a real asset to Ditto and thank you so much for your wonderful advice and service, it has been a real joy working with Ditto Australia.

There was simply no one else offering access to the stores I needed to get my music to at the price point they were quoting. I had read literally hundreds of horror story reviews about these guys and admittedly came into this business relationship with some prejudices.To date, I have released four singles through Ditto and am happy to say that, a few minor hiccups aside, things have gone rather smoothly. I only had to contact customer support once and was responded to by a representative that same day. After a few back and forth emails, the issue was resolved by the following morning. To me, this is exceptional service, but I can't speak for everyone.Ultimately, I am satisfied with the service I receive from Ditto, but I do see areas where things could be improved.

It would be nice to see buy on options for artists with a little bit of money. Also, tours that are allowing buy ons. Late NIght talk shows, like Fallon, Kimmel etc, have smaller and even unsigned bands perform. How would we be able to? 3: Merch discount opportunities. Companies that are willing to work with smaller labels and artists with maybe a discounted priced or smaller order quantities. 4. Promotion opportunities. Smaller, boutique agencies that help artists get on traditional radio, traditional charts, Spotify playlists, magazine interviews, blog reviews, etc. 5: Website opportunities.

However I have had various issues with them, particularly during the process of submitting releases, and I find the restricted access to sales analytics / trends if you're not an unlimited member very stingy. I paid high (in comparison to their competitors) upfront fees to make these releases and to make matters worse I have to pay annual fees to keep those releases up in the stores too, so I think full access to analytics should be the least they could offer in return. CD Baby is cheaper not only with their upfront fees, but there are no annual fees after that, and they give you full access to analytics for multiple stores as well, so I think Ditto should try to match this level of service. It would also help if they brought their prices more in line with the likes of CD Baby and abolish those annual fees. There is literally no justification for those annual fees anyway because once the release has been sent to the stores, that's it; there is no further work for Ditto to do to keep that release up there, so it's just blatant profiteering. I would really love to be able to support Ditto because I like working with smaller companies and helping them grow, but until their overall service improves I won't be submitting any more of my releases through them.",2017-03-02T11:07:16.000Z,"March 02, 2017",Eurielle Singer,3,GB,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/58b7fce4ed30e30a74fb6b40,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/58b7fcdd0000ff000a7d2479

5639c4dd0000ff000916ec3f,1,Stay away,"Dittomusic's attitude and conduct is terrible. Their response is fast when it involves transferring funds to them. However, when it comes to transferring funds to the customer and general inquiries, their response is slow and downright rude at times. They will reply with ridiculous excuses for their unprofessional behaviour when they have already shown that they can respond promptly. Their response is selective I.e. When a customer intends to transfer funds to them. At the moment, they have promised me to refund an incorrect charge directly on my credit card within 5 to 7 business days. Over 15 business days have passed and I have yet to receive a reply to my email. Dittomusic used to have a good reputation. However, over the past 3 years a lot of labels and artists as week as reviewed have reported poor conduct and dishonesty. Maybe they grew too fast and couldn't handle it or got greedy, I don't know exactly what but they don't seem to be very open either. At this rate, they will have setup heir own failure. Stay away from Dittomusic.Regarding royalties and Dittomusic's claim on how they don't keep royalties illegitimately. - They also claim to be unable to payput sales from unlicensed remixes (which is fair), however, they take no initiative or show any intention in redirecting sales originating from those remixes to the original copyright holder - it's a double standard.

56064c180000ff00090b9e9d,1,Do not trust them with your release please,"Ditto music are awful. I used them to release my video on vevo. The first time they messed up. Released it on early, made excuses, blamed me. I was accused to lying. To make it worse, they then took the video down but didn't put it up at the correct release date. This was their fault not vevo. It is clear they have no control or even care enough to get things right for their clients! In my stupidity I used them the second time hoping that if I explained what happened the first time they would do everything they can to make sure it didn't repeat itself. They did not. They did not release my video at the promised date and time. This cost me fans, it cost me a lot of tears and heartache especially not being able to reach them to rectify it. My fans tried to use the link in the messages pre-scheduled to them and it didn't work! On top of this, they couldn't get it sorted and kept making excuses. The story still gets worse believe it or not because they allowed vevo to load a 25second video for what was supposed to be 4mins. I told them to take this off asap- they promised vevo would. They should double check that they did considering everything that has happened. Here I am still in the middle of this mess. Believe it or not. I have only had excuses and no solution. They do not care. They have left information such as a question to them as it is uploaded to my vevo profile. They have no expertise. They do not care about artists. Please if you are an independent artist reading this. Do not trust them with anything important. I have cried so much because I have felt helpless and let down. They ruined what was supposed to a big stepping stone in my growing music career. I just need to make sure no one else is hurt by them. I never ever write bad reviews. I think let things go but this time on a mission to make sure what has happened and is happening to me doesn't happen to anyone else. It's hard enough being an independent artist trying to get heard.

Now with their Promotion package and Chart breaker packages also just their telephone support l have seen many Ditto artist break the top 10. Every artist l meet with whom l collaborate I've told them get your stuff on Ditto some have and forgotten they did it and have then gone back a year later too find they've made hundreds of pounds.,2015-07-09T16:33:44.516Z,"July 09, 2015",DJ BOXBOTTOM,2,GB,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/559ea2680000ff0002f4eba4,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/559ea14f0000ff0001cb98af

559d92c20000ff0002f4b306,5,"Simply The Best, Period!","I found Ditto while researching online music and video distribution for my last EP ""Black Denim"" out of Nashville. I was attracted by their UK base and the way they seemed to ""get"" what was missing from digital distribution services. Turned out I couldn't have been more right! Ditto Music is one of a kind. My prior experiences with CD Baby were fine... just fine, thats all. Ditto Music has taken what every artist wants in a record label opportunity and made it available to the world! Unlike every other music distribution company, they are real people [with real offices] who will meet with you face to face and get excited about your project, offering solid feedback on what, where and how to promote and sell your music. They essentially offer the indie artist everything a label does for very reasonable & straight forward cost.
