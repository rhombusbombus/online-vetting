I guess there's work to do on both sides, I'll keep experimenting to see what works.","great platform. i am not sure how the rankings work, but it is quite hard to be found if you do not have consistent work coming in, although you may be doing a great job, it will depend a lot on being a grammy nominated individual or trying to bring outside customers to the platform. although having tried that, they will take 8% fee or more altogether without a guarantee your profile will be pushed higher. i guess there's work to do on both sides, i'll keep experimenting to see what works."

642d521806b78432dcc31544,4,Great business model. Terrible execution,"UPDATED:Further to the review below, I have been explained the story by SoundBetter that it was in fact a problem with hyperwallet, the payment operator, and not with SoundBetter.In case you haven't seen, hyperwallets trustpilot score is shocking and so I am hoping SoundBetter can find an alternative solution to their payment systems to make things run more smoothly.So, 4 out of 5Any pro musicians/session musicians on here using SoundBetter?I'm not getting paid.I feel bad for the client, as he has lost his money.

62d43b964c35e69ec511bd85,5,Outstanding Talent,"I've been using SoundBetter for several years and dozens of projects and I've always been thoroughly satisfied. The ability to reach out to world class talent is a game-changer for independent artists, and more than that, it's a SAFE way to work for both clients and providers, both in terms of copyright protection and project funding. I've always found support from Alan or Jordan to be prompt and responsive on the few occasions when there's been a glitch. PROS: It's a premium platform, so you know the providers have been curated. Everyone I've worked with has been professional and dedicated. There's full visibility - from ALLMusic credits listed on the profile page to links to recent work or media appearances in the blog sidebar, SB tries to give us all we need to get a useful overview of the providers. Their search algorithm seems pretty good too, I've always found it to correspond closely to my experiences and I think they've made at least some effort to promote less visible talent who would otherwise get buried in the rankings. CONS: It can be time-consuming to find someone initially, in some categories there a LOT of providers, and besides the ""dead"" profiles (where someone appears to have signed up years ago and then abandoned it or moved on) there are a lot of incomplete or lazily-made profiles, sometimes just cut-and-paste from someone else's, or lacking proper samples we can listen to, for whatever reason. Do your research! It's often easy to find them with a quick Google search and discover more, or just reach out and ask if they can send a link to more samples. Sometimes a provider will be working under an alias for their personal projects and they can steer you to that. Lastly, the ""contact for pricing"" can be a little intimidating, but don't be afraid to get in touch anyway. I've always found everyone pretty reasonable, and you can usually negotiate too.",2022-07-17T18:40:54.000Z,"July 17, 2022",Saud,1,CA,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/62d43b964c35e69ec511bd85,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/62d43b8485bfd6001252a127,Outstanding Talent,outstanding talent,"I've been using SoundBetter for several years and dozens of projects and I've always been thoroughly satisfied.

6159fa636223e22118c1b202,1,SoundBetter 'team' completely unprofessional. Refuses refunds.Ignore e-mails. Enable scammers. No client protection.,"USE WITH CAUTION. The SoundBetter 'team' is HIGHLY UNPROFESSIONAL. They offer no protection to clients who get taken advantage of from greedy producers and musicians. When an issue comes up, you MIGHT be lucky to get an e-mail response to your issue. But don't expect any more than one. I have sent too many e-mails following up on an issue that continues to get ignored. They will not solve your problem. They most likely won't give you a refund, as I've found out too late after I was scammed, and talking to others who used their services who also got scammed. Why would they? They get a percentage of the payment on hired producers and musicians. They don't care if you get scammed, as long as they get their cut. They don't want to give it back and lose that profit. They won't actually look into your problem. They see very surface level, won't actually read what you say has been going on, just a brief skim to get it over with. For my situation, I hired a producer to create, mix, and master my song with existing vocals, ready for release. I gave him very specific references, and how I wanted the energy to be. He would refuse to do that. Eventually I had to settle on something completely different. He showed me an incomplete track he had previously made, so he did not create it for me. I had to settle with that after I realized he was not going to do what I asked, and straight up told me he wouldn't. After that, he continued to refuse to do anything I wanted to complete the track, and was clear he was going to do what he wanted to do. Especially since he wanted his name in the main title. He saw it as his project, not mine. He made some adjustments based on how he wanted, things I never asked and had to ask to undo, continuing to ask for the same basic  things I wanted from the beginning he would not do, or ignore. He was also horrible with communication. Large gaps in communication. Many errors with missing instruments, timing was off, would not fix an issue with the vocals. Eventually, after months of me asking for the same specific things he would never do, he demanded extra payments to do what I wanted. When I eventually gave in, because I already spent almost 2 THOUSAND DOLLARS, he STILL DIDN'T DO THOSE THINGS. Eventually he refused to finish it, and that he would no longer discuss it. And he just stopped responding, leaving my messages on 'seen'. For months. No finished product....AND GUESS WHAT? NO PROTECTION FROM SOUNDBETTER. Refund refused. Every e-mail after that ignored. It wasn't until I tried months later, and I got my bank involved who opened a case with SoundBetter, that a second member of the team offered me a partial refund. Then, the first team member replied when I asked why only a small amount when barely anything was done, and then the e-mails were left ignored. And the other 5 follow up e-mails ignored. The partial refund never came. Keep in mind, it has been what, over 6 MONTHS since I first e-mailed them. I've maybe had responses to 2 e-mails out of over a dozen spaced out over time. NOTHING.I've been absolutely shocked at how they can let this happen, allow the people who abuse their services to continue to scam multiple people without taking action, allowing that same person to repeat behaviour. But what's the most shocking is how unprofessional they are, how they purposefully ignore e-mails, follow up responses. And IF they offer you a partial refund, they won't actually end up giving it to you.

He made some adjustments based on how he wanted, things I never asked and had to ask to undo, continuing to ask for the same basic  things I wanted from the beginning he would not do, or ignore. He was also horrible with communication. Large gaps in communication. Many errors with missing instruments, timing was off, would not fix an issue with the vocals. Eventually, after months of me asking for the same specific things he would never do, he demanded extra payments to do what I wanted. When I eventually gave in, because I already spent almost 2 THOUSAND DOLLARS, he STILL DIDN'T DO THOSE THINGS. Eventually he refused to finish it, and that he would no longer discuss it. And he just stopped responding, leaving my messages on 'seen'. For months. No finished product....AND GUESS WHAT? NO PROTECTION FROM SOUNDBETTER. Refund refused. Every e-mail after that ignored. It wasn't until I tried months later, and I got my bank involved who opened a case with SoundBetter, that a second member of the team offered me a partial refund. Then, the first team member replied when I asked why only a small amount when barely anything was done, and then the e-mails were left ignored. And the other 5 follow up e-mails ignored. The partial refund never came. Keep in mind, it has been what, over 6 MONTHS since I first e-mailed them. I've maybe had responses to 2 e-mails out of over a dozen spaced out over time. NOTHING.I've been absolutely shocked at how they can let this happen, allow the people who abuse their services to continue to scam multiple people without taking action, allowing that same person to repeat behaviour. But what's the most shocking is how unprofessional they are, how they purposefully ignore e-mails, follow up responses. And IF they offer you a partial refund, they won't actually end up giving it to you. Even if you send 5 follow up e-mails, they will ignore it and not do anything.","use with caution. the soundbetter 'team' is highly unprofessional. they offer no protection to clients who get taken advantage of from greedy producers and musicians. when an issue comes up, you might be lucky to get an e-mail response to your issue. but don't expect any more than one. i have sent too many e-mails following up on an issue that continues to get ignored. they will not solve your problem. they most likely won't give you a refund, as i've found out too late after i was scammed, and talking to others who used their services who also got scammed. why would they? they get a percentage of the payment on hired producers and musicians. they don't care if you get scammed, as long as they get their cut. they don't want to give it back and lose that profit. they won't actually look into your problem. they see very surface level, won't actually read what you say has been going on, just a brief skim to get it over with. for my situation, i hired a producer to create, mix, and master my song with existing vocals, ready for release. i gave him very specific references, and how i wanted the energy to be. he would refuse to do that. eventually i had to settle on something completely different. he showed me an incomplete track he had previously made, so he did not create it for me. i had to settle with that after i realized he was not going to do what i asked, and straight up told me he wouldn't. after that, he continued to refuse to do anything i wanted to complete the track, and was clear he was going to do what he wanted to do. especially since he wanted his name in the main title. he saw it as his project, not mine. he made some adjustments based on how he wanted, things i never asked and had to ask to undo, continuing to ask for the same basic  things i wanted from the beginning he would not do, or ignore. he was also horrible with communication. large gaps in communication. many errors with missing instruments, timing was off, would not fix an issue with the vocals. eventually, after months of me asking for the same specific things he would never do, he demanded extra payments to do what i wanted. when i eventually gave in, because i already spent almost 2 thousand dollars, he still didn't do those things. eventually he refused to finish it, and that he would no longer discuss it. and he just stopped responding, leaving my messages on 'seen'. for months. no finished product....and guess what? no protection from soundbetter. refund refused. every e-mail after that ignored. it wasn't until i tried months later, and i got my bank involved who opened a case with soundbetter, that a second member of the team offered me a partial refund. then, the first team member replied when i asked why only a small amount when barely anything was done, and then the e-mails were left ignored. and the other 5 follow up e-mails ignored. the partial refund never came. keep in mind, it has been what, over 6 months since i first e-mailed them. i've maybe had responses to 2 e-mails out of over a dozen spaced out over time. nothing.i've been absolutely shocked at how they can let this happen, allow the people who abuse their services to continue to scam multiple people without taking action, allowing that same person to repeat behaviour. but what's the most shocking is how unprofessional they are, how they purposefully ignore e-mails, follow up responses. and if they offer you a partial refund, they won't actually end up giving it to you. even if you send 5 follow up e-mails, they will ignore it and not do anything."

If you’re a professional musician who invested money and time into your product, this platform allows clients to take advantage of you and even supports them getting a refund without any reason at all.

There’s other places that actually support musicians. Now that they’re owned by Spotify too it’s a double whammy of middle men who feel entitled to musicians’ work without protecting their rights or getting them fair compensation. If you’re a professional musician who invested money and time into your product, this platform allows clients to take advantage of you and even supports them getting a refund without any reason at all. If you’re in this business you understand how ridiculous that is and how much that puts you at risk of not getting paid for your work. I would give zero stars if it were an option.","these guys are not a trustworthy platform. they use you to advertise their site by inviting people to “review you” which is seemingly the only way they will consider you to be a “premium provider” (pay to have the chance to bid on gigs). this isn’t like other sites that actually only let people who you worked with review you so they could be totally fake making it impossible to trust who you’re working with because clients have these reviews too. the site is completely geared towards clients also and if you’re a provider their faq makes it very clear that you have absolutely no rights and they will not support you if there’s a dispute. this seems to be just about the most toxic environment any professional could possibly enter. if you’re thinking about joining this platform as a provider just don’t. there’s other places that actually support musicians. now that they’re owned by spotify too it’s a double whammy of middle men who feel entitled to musicians’ work without protecting their rights or getting them fair compensation. if you’re a professional musician who invested money and time into your product, this platform allows clients to take advantage of you and even supports them getting a refund without any reason at all. if you’re in this business you understand how ridiculous that is and how much that puts you at risk of not getting paid for your work. i would give zero stars if it were an option."
5f6fc2ba798e6f0960210668,1,SoundBetter is abusive towards providers,"As a session singer, a producer a songwriter, a mixer, and a  mastering engineer, and as someone with over 160 5 star reviews on another platform, as soon as I started working as a premium provider on SoundBetter, I was abused by users who had no business being on that site to being with. One of them loved my song that I wrote, produced, and performed for her, but she loved it so much that she ambushed me at the end of the project, saying I would not be paid unless I gave up 100% of my copyright. SoundBetter knew this, and yet they still allowed the person to continue on the site and endanger other providers. I honestly could not believe that this is how they ""deal"" with the abuse that they manifest on their site - at the very very least - you would think that they would delete the user who is clearly going to be a danger to other providers! But no, a penny will clearly always be more important to SoundBetter than any artist ever will. The staff at SoundBetter literally does not care if the providers are abused, and they will go above and beyond to ignore everything that has to do with abuse (hence the D- minus rating on their Better Business Bureau profile).  I filed a dispute with them on BBB and they couldn't even respond because they knew that I had been abused.  So Providers would all be much happier if they migrated elsewhere to a platform that actually cares about their wellbeing.  It's also a waste of time to do over 30 hours of work for a large-price-tag-style job and then not be paid for it because someone wants to coerce you out of your own copyright holder rights.  So even from a financial and logistical standpoint, it's not a logical strategy to choose this specific platform to conduct business.  You will have to invest a ton of money to even gain any traction (if you even get that) and you will be forced to tell all of your friends about it too before you make a single cent (because they force you to bring in outside reviews from your own friends/family/clients before being able to get premium provider status, regardless of how many reviews you show them that you garnered from other platforms - they are using people for advertising and they don't actually care about your pre-existing credibility).  So you will end up investing a ton of energy and money for about a year or more only to find that none of it was ever worth it and your energy would be better used elsewhere.",2020-09-26T22:37:46.000Z,"September 26, 2020",Artist A,1,US,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/5f6fc2ba798e6f0960210668,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5f6fbf81d04310dd1fc40ceb,SoundBetter is abusive towards providers,soundbetter is abusive towards providers,"As a session singer, a producer a songwriter, a mixer, and a  mastering engineer, and as someone with over 160 5 star reviews on another platform, as soon as I started working as a premium provider on SoundBetter, I was abused by users who had no business being on that site to being with.

I'd say I've gotten back 1 decent track out of several. The worst part of working with Sound Better is the dishonest feedback from their studio musicians. If you look into ""feedback left"" and ""feedback received"" you'll notice a dishonest pattern of obnoxious ass kissing. Everyone's great at this and great at that(Hence the 5 star reviews plastered everywhere). We know not everyone is great at what they do, So when you see this it should be a red flag! I've worked with guitar players that had 5 or 6 projects going on at once and it showed with tracks they tried to pawn off on me. Horrendous to the point I gave up and got a refund immediately! One good thing I can say on Sound Better's behalf is they issue refunds quickly if you're not satisfied. However, More than likely, You will waste a lot of time waiting for something exceptional to come of your tracks. Parallel to what Mr M said, inexperienced musicians/users of Sound Better really don't have a clue of what sounds exceptional so they accept whatever is thrown at them thinking it's better than what they originally expected. The truth is a lot of musicians suck and it's hard to accept that, So instead these studio musicians take these less than spectacular musicians money and run with it!   Let this be a warning....If you send a track to a selected Producer/Guitarist, etc and they reply with some ass kissing talking point- Run, Run Far Away!!
