Musicians I hired to play or sing specific material, are not able to communicate except thru the SB email.  Working thru email back and forth is slow and not productive.  Plus, the musician can't get immediate feedback and is having to guess if the part they were hired to record is  correct. If certain talent and producers would be encouraged to work via Zoom or another on-line audio/video streaming service, the whole picture would change.  Immediate connection between talent and producer.  Since the connection could be made using a SoundBetter portal, security would be maintained.

65ce7a80ad73d7013a7e2954,5,I'm 80% of the way through recording my EP over Soundbetter,"I've had an overall really positive experience through Soundbetter. It's pretty surprising how many talented musicians there are. But the bigger thing is how many experienced musicians there are with A-list credits.The toughest thing is finding musicians who are the right fit with all the options. The vast majority of the musicians I've worked with have been a great fit. But a couple times I've finished a job with someone and realized I'm going to need someone else to record that part over because it just didn't cut it. Sometimes it was because of someone not being the best fit in the genre, sometimes because they didn't quite listen to directions well enough, etc.I think if you really take the time to figure out what you want (quality level, style, etc.) find musicians who are the right fit, and communicate clearly with them, you can get fantastic results on Soundbetter.It's amazing that people this talented and experienced are within reach and willing to work!",2024-02-15T22:56:32.000Z,"February 15, 2024",Matthew Dodson,1,US,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/65ce7a80ad73d7013a7e2954,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/65ce7a777ccd14001172bf47

No, he had poor communication and wouldn’t even confirm receipt of my order, no explanation of the process, what i can expect, when i can expect to hear from him etc so i messaged Sound Better and requested a refund. Sound better then takes my communication and shares it with the seller so the seller then reaches out to me using my communication to Sound Better against me.I had already told the seller to void my order before he had even seen the order bc so many days had passed. But right when i email the platform to cancel the seller emails me and says he will be done with my order shortly.Wow, so you go from never seeing the order details (as you can see when someone views your messages on the platform) to almost being done with building a custom beat around my vocals and can send it to me that day? SmhHe was lying so he could make an argument to keep my money because Sound Better was relaying my emails to him. Shady business practices.

I reached out March 24th to gain clarity. I was told it was stored as credit that I can't see nor have access to through my account. I ask to use the credit to fund a new job. No response for 3 days. I followed up on the 5th day. I sent an email on the 6th day. After the 7th I asked the person Im working with if they could email them to get the job going. At this point I just want the money back in my account. I received a response finally on April 4th and then I was ghosted. I still have not received a refund. I'm normally relaxed about this type of stuff. But  have received zero communication while you're holding my money and the job up. It don't cost nothing to let me know things will take time.After this review and 2 weeks of delay they sent my refund via paypal as goods and services so that I could be charged a fee. Lmaoo.

I've actually funds blocked by someone who've been ignoring my message for months. I've send 7 emails the every adress I've been abble to find (Jordan / Alan / info at .....) nothing happen. There's no ticket or reference system which clearly means that they don't are about the follow up of anything. This platform looks like it works by itself.

We are talking about the total amount of $2.500,00!!!! There is no such thing as a contract existing.

62d43b964c35e69ec511bd85,5,Outstanding Talent,"I've been using SoundBetter for several years and dozens of projects and I've always been thoroughly satisfied. The ability to reach out to world class talent is a game-changer for independent artists, and more than that, it's a SAFE way to work for both clients and providers, both in terms of copyright protection and project funding. I've always found support from Alan or Jordan to be prompt and responsive on the few occasions when there's been a glitch. PROS: It's a premium platform, so you know the providers have been curated. Everyone I've worked with has been professional and dedicated. There's full visibility - from ALLMusic credits listed on the profile page to links to recent work or media appearances in the blog sidebar, SB tries to give us all we need to get a useful overview of the providers. Their search algorithm seems pretty good too, I've always found it to correspond closely to my experiences and I think they've made at least some effort to promote less visible talent who would otherwise get buried in the rankings. CONS: It can be time-consuming to find someone initially, in some categories there a LOT of providers, and besides the ""dead"" profiles (where someone appears to have signed up years ago and then abandoned it or moved on) there are a lot of incomplete or lazily-made profiles, sometimes just cut-and-paste from someone else's, or lacking proper samples we can listen to, for whatever reason. Do your research! It's often easy to find them with a quick Google search and discover more, or just reach out and ask if they can send a link to more samples. Sometimes a provider will be working under an alias for their personal projects and they can steer you to that. Lastly, the ""contact for pricing"" can be a little intimidating, but don't be afraid to get in touch anyway. I've always found everyone pretty reasonable, and you can usually negotiate too.",2022-07-17T18:40:54.000Z,"July 17, 2022",Saud,1,CA,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/62d43b964c35e69ec511bd85,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/62d43b8485bfd6001252a127

This week I accepted a job from a client. I should have been suspicious because the pay was too good to be true. I spent a day recording the vocals and sent them to the client. They didn't thank me for my work, but just abruptly asked if I could make some changes. It was very unprofessional and I became worried. I made the edits they asked for and quickly sent them back. Again, they didn't respond to thank me or acknowledge receipt of files. Looking closer, I see the client has no reviews. Clearly it's someone dodgy.I have written to Soundbetter asking for support but I haven't heard back from either party in days. It looks like I've been scammed, and I won't get paid for hours of hard and conscientious work. Word of warning: be very careful when accepting jobs from users with no reviews! It seems as though Soundbetter are not there to support you when things go wrong. It's a real shame as it's affected my trust in the site going forwards.

I'll start from when I first started working with them, I was looking for a freelancer page meant for engineers. After working with them for about a year now I can say that they have gone to crap since Spotify dropped the company. Ever since that has happened I have not been getting paid for any of the jobs I've COMPLETED and the clients have been SATISFIED this is purely a middleman issue not the clients fault so of course I'm not going to tell the clients. I just kept working in hopes Soundbetter would eventually pay me (keep in mind this is how I make a living). I truly had faith in the company and the vision, but now I have lost all that and my respect. During this 3 month process they have completely been ignoring my emails, Instagram Dms, Intercom messages, and they have closed their phone line probably due to have an astonishing garbage customer service and drop of costs. If you're curious the amount of money they owe me is over $500 but to be honest it's not about the money anymore I just feel lied to, disrespected and completely blind-sided. Not to mention I also have an issue where there is about 2 of my clients that have ignored me after completing the job for them and then being satisfied and then never pressing marked as complete. (I was already aware that this was a fatal flaw of the website, but I didn't know they ignored emails.)  I received ONE email back saying they were automatically marking the jobs as complete in 10 days for the people that were ignoring me but COMPLETELY IGNORED the fact that that wasn't my only issue. I haven't gotten paid from even when the job has been marked as complete! And when the 10 days passed, nothing happened. NOTHING. After sending over 100 emails I have yet to receive ONE response back. And of course no money back either. I'm in contact with my lawyer about this company and the BBB. I come on here still in hopes that this business can do better and strive and of course want the damn money I worked for. If you're curious to learn more about me, send me a message on Instagram @813rico. Stay away from this company at all costs right now.

I have even left a similar review on the Better Business Bureau already. As far as booking a musician or professional, I had great experiences and would support the freelancers using the site. However, this platform has the worst management, back end, and customer service I have ever experienced. I put in a request to upgrade my account to premium sometime in the fall of 2021, and waited a long period before hearing back. Towards the end of February (2022), Jordan from SoundBetter reached back out to me, informing me that SoundBetter was considering to upgrade my account to premium and that my account needed several adjustments before upgrading. If you didn't know, upgrading to premium means you can respond to jobs posted and find more work, as well as show up better in the platform's search engine. Nevertheless, I told him doing that was okay, but asked if I can use another account I had with them which was already updated and had three great reviews. When I finally heard back, he completely ignored my mention of the other account and reminded me to upgrade the account he reached out about. So, like any person I did as he asked and completed it to its fullest. This time, after waiting for a reply, he emailed me and informed me that I was not upgraded to a premium account and it was on a ""rolling basis"" and I should wait for another time in the future. THIS IS NOT PROFESSIONAL, AND I FEEL TOTALLY LED ON. Times are hard right now especially for musicians, and for Jordan to lead me to believe I will finally start making money while doing what I love most, only to tell me after doing everything he said, you are not considered any more and have to wait... what the hell?

It has been the most incredible platform to connect with other creative humans from all around the world. Obviously a steady income is beneficial to anyone creating music for a living but just to wake up everyday not knowing if i'll be working with Ben in Iceland, Corrine in LA, Jaques in Paris... is thrilling. I work on a variety of projects in all genres. From epic, emotive trailers for film and tv to little lullaby ditty's for children and everything in between. I wake up excited to start the day and connect with amazing people - the exchange of creativity and vulnerability between two humans makes life magical in ways I could never have imagined.

6159fa636223e22118c1b202,1,SoundBetter 'team' completely unprofessional. Refuses refunds.Ignore e-mails. Enable scammers. No client protection.,"USE WITH CAUTION. The SoundBetter 'team' is HIGHLY UNPROFESSIONAL. They offer no protection to clients who get taken advantage of from greedy producers and musicians. When an issue comes up, you MIGHT be lucky to get an e-mail response to your issue. But don't expect any more than one. I have sent too many e-mails following up on an issue that continues to get ignored. They will not solve your problem. They most likely won't give you a refund, as I've found out too late after I was scammed, and talking to others who used their services who also got scammed. Why would they? They get a percentage of the payment on hired producers and musicians. They don't care if you get scammed, as long as they get their cut. They don't want to give it back and lose that profit. They won't actually look into your problem. They see very surface level, won't actually read what you say has been going on, just a brief skim to get it over with. For my situation, I hired a producer to create, mix, and master my song with existing vocals, ready for release. I gave him very specific references, and how I wanted the energy to be. He would refuse to do that. Eventually I had to settle on something completely different. He showed me an incomplete track he had previously made, so he did not create it for me. I had to settle with that after I realized he was not going to do what I asked, and straight up told me he wouldn't. After that, he continued to refuse to do anything I wanted to complete the track, and was clear he was going to do what he wanted to do. Especially since he wanted his name in the main title. He saw it as his project, not mine. He made some adjustments based on how he wanted, things I never asked and had to ask to undo, continuing to ask for the same basic  things I wanted from the beginning he would not do, or ignore. He was also horrible with communication. Large gaps in communication. Many errors with missing instruments, timing was off, would not fix an issue with the vocals. Eventually, after months of me asking for the same specific things he would never do, he demanded extra payments to do what I wanted. When I eventually gave in, because I already spent almost 2 THOUSAND DOLLARS, he STILL DIDN'T DO THOSE THINGS. Eventually he refused to finish it, and that he would no longer discuss it. And he just stopped responding, leaving my messages on 'seen'. For months. No finished product....AND GUESS WHAT? NO PROTECTION FROM SOUNDBETTER. Refund refused. Every e-mail after that ignored. It wasn't until I tried months later, and I got my bank involved who opened a case with SoundBetter, that a second member of the team offered me a partial refund. Then, the first team member replied when I asked why only a small amount when barely anything was done, and then the e-mails were left ignored. And the other 5 follow up e-mails ignored. The partial refund never came. Keep in mind, it has been what, over 6 MONTHS since I first e-mailed them. I've maybe had responses to 2 e-mails out of over a dozen spaced out over time. NOTHING.I've been absolutely shocked at how they can let this happen, allow the people who abuse their services to continue to scam multiple people without taking action, allowing that same person to repeat behaviour. But what's the most shocking is how unprofessional they are, how they purposefully ignore e-mails, follow up responses. And IF they offer you a partial refund, they won't actually end up giving it to you. Even if you send 5 follow up e-mails, they will ignore it and not do anything.",2021-10-03T19:21:39.000Z,"October 03, 2021",Olivia,1,CA,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6159fa636223e22118c1b202,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/6159fa584f5cd500121fd3c0

Quite often, a client will be unhappy with a mix when the vocal performance or production is the issue however soundbetter but does little to protect you during these claims.

OK I pay 300 USD which I don't think is unfair considering everything right now. But should I stand for an artist mistake and get such answer?

5f6fcf5a798e6f096021092f,1,Sounds like a Better Idea to go someplace else...,"These guys are not a trustworthy platform. They use you to advertise their site by inviting people to “review you” which is seemingly the only way they will consider you to be a “premium provider” (pay to have the chance to bid on gigs). This isn’t like other sites that actually only let people who you worked with review you so they could be totally fake making it impossible to trust who you’re working with because clients have these reviews too. The site is completely geared towards clients also and if you’re a provider their faq makes it very clear that you have absolutely no rights and they will not support you if there’s a dispute. This seems to be just about the most toxic environment any professional could possibly enter. If you’re thinking about joining this platform as a provider just don’t. There’s other places that actually support musicians. Now that they’re owned by Spotify too it’s a double whammy of middle men who feel entitled to musicians’ work without protecting their rights or getting them fair compensation. If you’re a professional musician who invested money and time into your product, this platform allows clients to take advantage of you and even supports them getting a refund without any reason at all. If you’re in this business you understand how ridiculous that is and how much that puts you at risk of not getting paid for your work.

5f6fc2ba798e6f0960210668,1,SoundBetter is abusive towards providers,"As a session singer, a producer a songwriter, a mixer, and a  mastering engineer, and as someone with over 160 5 star reviews on another platform, as soon as I started working as a premium provider on SoundBetter, I was abused by users who had no business being on that site to being with. One of them loved my song that I wrote, produced, and performed for her, but she loved it so much that she ambushed me at the end of the project, saying I would not be paid unless I gave up 100% of my copyright. SoundBetter knew this, and yet they still allowed the person to continue on the site and endanger other providers. I honestly could not believe that this is how they ""deal"" with the abuse that they manifest on their site - at the very very least - you would think that they would delete the user who is clearly going to be a danger to other providers! But no, a penny will clearly always be more important to SoundBetter than any artist ever will. The staff at SoundBetter literally does not care if the providers are abused, and they will go above and beyond to ignore everything that has to do with abuse (hence the D- minus rating on their Better Business Bureau profile).  I filed a dispute with them on BBB and they couldn't even respond because they knew that I had been abused.  So Providers would all be much happier if they migrated elsewhere to a platform that actually cares about their wellbeing.  It's also a waste of time to do over 30 hours of work for a large-price-tag-style job and then not be paid for it because someone wants to coerce you out of your own copyright holder rights.  So even from a financial and logistical standpoint, it's not a logical strategy to choose this specific platform to conduct business.  You will have to invest a ton of money to even gain any traction (if you even get that) and you will be forced to tell all of your friends about it too before you make a single cent (because they force you to bring in outside reviews from your own friends/family/clients before being able to get premium provider status, regardless of how many reviews you show them that you garnered from other platforms - they are using people for advertising and they don't actually care about your pre-existing credibility).  So you will end up investing a ton of energy and money for about a year or more only to find that none of it was ever worth it and your energy would be better used elsewhere.",2020-09-26T22:37:46.000Z,"September 26, 2020",Artist A,1,US,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/5f6fc2ba798e6f0960210668,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5f6fbf81d04310dd1fc40ceb

I'd say I've gotten back 1 decent track out of several. The worst part of working with Sound Better is the dishonest feedback from their studio musicians. If you look into ""feedback left"" and ""feedback received"" you'll notice a dishonest pattern of obnoxious ass kissing. Everyone's great at this and great at that(Hence the 5 star reviews plastered everywhere). We know not everyone is great at what they do, So when you see this it should be a red flag! I've worked with guitar players that had 5 or 6 projects going on at once and it showed with tracks they tried to pawn off on me. Horrendous to the point I gave up and got a refund immediately! One good thing I can say on Sound Better's behalf is they issue refunds quickly if you're not satisfied. However, More than likely, You will waste a lot of time waiting for something exceptional to come of your tracks. Parallel to what Mr M said, inexperienced musicians/users of Sound Better really don't have a clue of what sounds exceptional so they accept whatever is thrown at them thinking it's better than what they originally expected. The truth is a lot of musicians suck and it's hard to accept that, So instead these studio musicians take these less than spectacular musicians money and run with it!

5f497ede02e8570814fb518b,1,Parasitic website feeding on inexperienced artists,"I'm a very experienced music professional. SoundBetter is another parasitic middle-man that offers a dysfunctional platform that is not tailored for professional music production.It works 'ok' for straightforward technical works like mastering, but they try to constrain professionals and clients to negotiate fees and deadlines and do the whole process and transactions through their system, where they'll take a 5% cut from other people's work. Music production is a highly complex work, and the SB system was tailored as an oversimplification aimed at scamming inexperienced artists into paying extra for inexperienced, desperate bedroom engineers who are foolish enough to pay a monthly fee to gain 'visibility' in their website. Do you want to have your music professionally produced, mixed or mastered? It's simple: Google your favorite professionals, like someone that produced an album you enjoy, find their website/social media, and drop them a line. It's that simple. Real pros are always easy to find and frequently affordable, and will be able to make you a great offer and deliver the real deal according to your musical goals.Using this service as a client is a shot in the dark. You'll probably end up with an overpriced (remember the 5% surcharge), inexperienced engineer who will be losing money to those scammers.And if you're a budding sound engineer it's a much wiser investment designing a killer website, putting ads on relevant places and doing low-paid works to friends and local acts to develop a reputation and connections in your musical genre.
