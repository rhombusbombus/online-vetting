659465e747b567ef6be78090,1,Spend Your Money Elsewhere,"So I've recently used these guys a couple of times and ran multiple campaigns. The short answer is spend your money elsewhere. First off you don't really have any control over what playlists are chosen although you do get to choose genres. The problem I've learned with these type of campaigns is that curators might not always agree on genres. Second, everyone has an opinion, meaning in order for your music to get on a playlist a curator has to like it and that could differ from day to day and the mood they just happen to be in at the time. I literally had multiple reviews that said ""we love your song and your so talented!"" but nope we're skipping this one because it doesn't fit our playlist mood..."" I will also say that their curator/playlist picks for your music are questionable from what I have witnessed. The service also doesn't result in organic followers like other services do that I have used and ultimately this service doesn't really deliver in my opinion and they don't refund either.  At the time of writing this review I have another campaign on the same tracks with another service that has resulted in 3000 streams in the last 3 days with organic followers because they use a different methodology that hits people not curators. My advice? Don't rely on the curator game to get your music out there to people who would really like it. Instead use services that get your music seen across the internet to normal people and let them decide. It's a simple numbers game. If you're relying on a curator it's like only betting on black at the roulette table. Instead opt for services that spread your music using more proven methods that result in way more streams and followers. Also these guys don't really let you respond to curators either. You just get to rate their review and select from three options as your response.

64b72fad2218a40710591a0d,4,Gabriel's response has been outstanding,"Gabriel has been outstanding in his genuine concern for artists, reviewed by curators. He explains the rules and helps us understand how the company works.  My recent campaign did alright. I got my album cut of the song Antidote Blvd onto 3 playlists with 4 new followers, but these were curators that previously liked the single version and put it on their playlist.  I find it difficult how some curators are very appreciative of new artists work while others refuse to give new talent little opportunity to succeed and are somewhat rude and arrogant in their reviews.  Many curators go out of their way to thank us and tell us what we did right even though denying access to their playlist.  This brings me to my main concern, as I have previously mentioned to Gabriel.  We artists spend days and weeks composing, recording and offering up our material with the little hard earned funds we have available.  It is my request that there should be a more fair structure on how curators are paid for reviewing our work.  Our goal as artists is exposure and I understand that if the work is far below standards it should be restricted, but the main vetting should  not be done via the subjective opinion of a handful of curators. If they deny access to their playlist the amount they earn should be at a scaled rate. Some of us older artists have literally listened to millions of songs over decades, performed for years and recorded many originals. We have the highest standards ingrained into our songwriting sensibility. So I urge, that curators be granted an initial listen of a song.  If they determine it is not a good match for their playlist, they should be allowed to PASS on it's review and allow the next curator an opportunity, saving the hard earned dollars of the artist to acheive the maximum potential for exposure of the song. If I pay for 20 curators I expect to have my song on a minimum of 10 playlists for at least one month.  How else will we make progress? And if no additional curators are availabe to complete the campaign, we go by the current stadard of those monies be refunded towards the next campaign.

64670866376b1a02e87b6b50,5,"I don't know much about networking, BUT...","What this company is doing well is finding all sort of playlists that I didn't know about. It saved me a lot of time and effort looking for relevant playlists myself, because I'm not familiar with any at all. I'm also already preoccupied trying to do literally everything else myself including mixing and mastering to also include networking in all of it. It was my first campaign and every response I got was a rejection, but it was the first time I actually got any real feedback on any of my songs on Spotify, and one of the first times anyone has ever commented on my music in over seven years since I started trying to get noticed.

They really keep in touch with you regarding campaigns and email every time you get some reviews.    The Playlists*Song 1 got added to a playlist with a Spanish ""En Ingles"" type of title where it got some play and I believe I gained some organic exposure. Not sure if the Spanish playlist was the best fit honestly but It did seem to fit in with the established artists (singing in English) on the playlist so I'm not sure that it matters. ;-) Song 2 also got added to a Spanish title playlist with all English speaking classic tracks from the 70's, 80's, and 90's. My tracks are pretty modern with a tinge of a classic feel so...;-) This track just got added also to a a Blues Rock Playlist which kind of fits with the track but it isn't a ""blues"" track per se.      After the campaign starts:Their website is really great and includes reviews from curators when they accept and decline the tracks. The reviews almost always say good song, great job type of stuff and when they decline the tracks it says ""great work but it doesn't fit with the style on my playlist"" type of message. Some feedback about production was interesting which was helpful. It just makes me wonder how carefully the song is pitched with ""appropriate"" type of playlists. For example I think my tracks are better suited for more contemporary artists rather than classic rock. The songs can stay on a playlist longer than thought so that is very cool. So in conclusion, I'm very happy with the service and results so far.They even refunded me partial amounts when curators didn't get back to them.In conclusion: Pros1. Got some placements2.

I kinda put those concerns aside, attributing them to 'those users may have just had bad songs' and rolled the dice with a budget of $ 300. But it turns out they were right.What happens when you set up a campaign is that you select your song, a budget and choose genres. SoundCampaign will then submit your song to curators. But here is the first snag: genres are broad in and of itself, and most curators are looking for something that fits their playlist perfectly. You cannot select tempo (slow songs or upbeat), or even 'sounds like this-and-this artist', so you are automatically a bad fit for a lot of them. You cannot see beforehand which curators you'll be submitting to, or look at their playlists (unlike, say, other hub's you can submit), so you're basically shooting blind.About the curators. There's a lot to tell, so let me make it easy to follow:1. They aren't really looking for new songs. Or at least, most of them.

If you're like me and my bandmates in Potomack, then you've had your fair share of trial and error with so many of the potentially fraudulent businesses from the most obscure crevices of the web known to man, and with ZERO results!We basically pulled the trigger on a sound campaign for our newest single, ""Flow Addikk,"" produced by the legendary grammy award winning producer/mixer/engineer, Toby Wright (Metallica, Alice in Chains, Korn, Sevendust). Campaign set-up took less than 5 minutes and there's an option to dial in your target audience, which we found to be very helpful, you enter your budget amount and it gives you the number of curators that your song will be sent to for review, and the number of potential playlists your song can get added to.About two days into the campaign reviews started to come in from legitimate Spotify curators with moderate to substantial sized playlists. BOOM, first review we landed on a playlist of about 5,000 listeners and then the big one with 26,000 listeners. Our streaming numbers averaged over 120 plays on our track a day and our monthly listeners went from 11 to 575 and with over 1100 streams from one big playlist alone in less than two weeks. We plan on using SoundCampaign again when we drop our other BANGER ""Unworthy"" tomorrow! We hit The Audio Compound in Orlando, FL to record this one and it was such a sick experience working with the likes of Andrew Wade and his entire staff!What it honestly boils down to for Potomack is this; SoundCampaign found a way for the truly talented artists that never had a leg up to shine through all of the noise. Their first-in-class A&R team ensures only quality music gets approved for pitching to their partnered Spotify curators and any one of which could great increase the visibility of your brand in less than 2 weeks. There's a band called ""Lockjaw"" who got their newest single on the same 26k playlist that we did ""Extreme Metal,"" and then also got on about 18 other playlists within the same 14 day campaign and their numbers where over 150k streams and 35k monthly listeners. If you can see the forest for the trees and use a service like SoundCampaign to its fullest utility, then we believe it can be a game changer!

We're on a quest to try and accomplish what Lockjaw was able to accomplish and to do that we're going to tweak our target audience to get rid of outlier genres and increase the budget to increase the number of curators and playlists we can work with!","our first experience using soundcampaign was absolutely mind-boggling! if you're like me and my bandmates in potomack, then you've had your fair share of trial and error with so many of the potentially fraudulent businesses from the most obscure crevices of the web known to man, and with zero results!we basically pulled the trigger on a sound campaign for our newest single, ""flow addikk,"" produced by the legendary grammy award winning producer/mixer/engineer, toby wright (metallica, alice in chains, korn, sevendust). campaign set-up took less than 5 minutes and there's an option to dial in your target audience, which we found to be very helpful, you enter your budget amount and it gives you the number of curators that your song will be sent to for review, and the number of potential playlists your song can get added to.about two days into the campaign reviews started to come in from legitimate spotify curators with moderate to substantial sized playlists. boom, first review we landed on a playlist of about 5,000 listeners and then the big one with 26,000 listeners. our streaming numbers averaged over 120 plays on our track a day and our monthly listeners went from 11 to 575 and with over 1100 streams from one big playlist alone in less than two weeks. we plan on using soundcampaign again when we drop our other banger ""unworthy"" tomorrow! we hit the audio compound in orlando, fl to record this one and it was such a sick experience working with the likes of andrew wade and his entire staff!what it honestly boils down to for potomack is this; soundcampaign found a way for the truly talented artists that never had a leg up to shine through all of the noise. their first-in-class a&r team ensures only quality music gets approved for pitching to their partnered spotify curators and any one of which could great increase the visibility of your brand in less than 2 weeks. there's a band called ""lockjaw"" who got their newest single on the same 26k playlist that we did ""extreme metal,"" and then also got on about 18 other playlists within the same 14 day campaign and their numbers where over 150k streams and 35k monthly listeners. if you can see the forest for the trees and use a service like soundcampaign to its fullest utility, then we believe it can be a game changer! we're on a quest to try and accomplish what lockjaw was able to accomplish and to do that we're going to tweak our target audience to get rid of outlier genres and increase the budget to increase the number of curators and playlists we can work with!"

6142a955215cfcced2673090,5,SoundCampaign has helped my single gain streams,"SoundCampaign has been a huge help in getting my bands new single streamed and on playlists. Playlist curators will provide critique and feedback for your song whether they list it on their playlist or not. Any criticism/praise we have received has been done with the utmost respect and professionalism. Also I enjoy the fact that if a song is sent to 15 curators and only 10 place the song on their list, you will receive a refund for the 5 that didnt place you. I think this is amazing as other promotion sites will take your money whether you get placed or not. The team that I have spoken to over email seem friendly and they I find that if i have had any question it has been answered in a timely manner. I am going to utilize Sound Campaign for all our releases, I have already signed on for our third campaign. Budget is important, the larger your budget, the more playlists you can get on. Having said that, it is not such a high number that would be out of reach for a band to cycle a campaign more than once, especially if there is even just 2 members in a band. Overall, as an independent artist with no record label backing, SoundCampaign is a great service that helps get your material placed in spotify curator lists.

People will soon see your deception and ill intentions!","they made all my piano playlists inactive! when you complain you'll get generic response like our manager team blah blah blah!behind the curtain, they are private recording company who needs to control the playlist market (indie curators) because that's only what is left for them now. they don't need indie curators, they need total control! what they really need is control, and what they do is a pure manipulation of a naive artists and curators.update for your replyoh, you play on public humiliation card! let's see where this goes! first, you have zero compunction when it comes to manipulating the general public!1. please stop using the word kindly, kindness is the state of the heart, use politely instead, that is how hypocrites act to conceal their real intentions. so what you just did is polite, but not kind at all!it is actually the most dishonest way of treating somone! i also got the mail from the trustpilot that you think that i didn't have a genuine experience with you, so i had to send them the proof. that explaines how honest and kind you are!2. you made inactive some of the best performing playlists of well-established fellow curators that i've known and they told me they had been threatend by your managerial staff with ban. some of them never got paid, you have exuse for evrything, of course. 3. your rating system is a pure deception, it's made for dogs! this is how this works, you have 15 lvl and one curator can earn up to 14$ per review! no s61t!  so the scoring table goes 1500 points for $1, 5000 for 2$, 10000 for $3, 25000 for $4, 50000 for $5, 75000 for $6, 100000 for $7, etc. per review.the moment you see some of the curators are performing well, gaining points = $...here comes the most interesting part... you start deactivating their playlists, not responding, avoiding to give clear answers, you do everything just to make them look bad and just to avoid to pay them say $8 per review! no artists would ever agree to give any curator, nor would any real curator wanted to take more then 3$ per review no matter how big is the playlist, and yet your scam system goes up to 14$! how would you justify that greed unless greed is your creed!4. all your responses are completely generic, we sometimes have to wait for 2 days just to get bot message. meaninglessly polite bot messages.5. curators need platform to connect with artists, 99% of the curators that i know are artists including myslef, so we are well aware of artist's needs and desires. you failed miserably! people will soon see your deception and ill intentions!"

60b247d6f9f4870a94b09689,1,Would not recommend - read my experience,"I would not recommend SoundCamps for those looking for true ""organic"" promotion.From my own experience, here is my reasoning.1. My genre of music (e.g. bedroom pop) I selected when I submitted the song, seemed to be sent to playlist curators of a completely different genre. One of the reviews I received said something like ""I wish I had a bedroom pop playlist"". After emailing with customer service, this seemed to be just an excuse for not reviewing the song.2. Playlists can be full of bots. My song was put into a playlist of over 22k follower and I strongly believe these were mainly bots (you can tell using Chartmetric and Spotify for Artists). The bots have IP addresses from about 5 major cities in the USA, Mexico etc. Almost everyone in the playlist has the same top city of Mexico City. This may seem like your song growing an audience but the truth is the steams are fake, it hurts your Spotify algorithm, as the song will be recommended to the wrong users (with random preferences of genre) and puts you at risk of being taken down by Spotify. Not to mention getting blacklisted from Spotify editorial playlists.3. After contacting Spotify for Artists regarding the latter, they advised me to ""[review all] promotional and marketing efforts"".4. Be aware that the ""Artist Protection Program"" only refunds money as credit in your account, so you are forced to spend it with them again. This leaves you in a bad situation if the curator does not review your song, which happened to me almost straight after ordering.5. The reviews I received had poor grammar/spelling, seemed very generic, and had poor attention to detail. I understand this is a worldwide service with users of different nationalities but this was not really good enough.6. I raised my issues with customer service, and instead of taking action to request (but not force, as I know they cannot do this) that the curator removes my song from the bot playlist, they asked me to pay for more of their 'services', at a discounted rate - I found this insulting. They have not offered any alternative way to help solve things.I do not want to spend more money, I want support and for the company to rectify for the service I already bought.In conclusion, SoundCamps makes no promises about the streams you will get, which makes it seem a better and safer option, and is why I chose them. But in my experience, curators ignored my song and didn't review it, I was added to a playlist of bots that ruins my statistics and reduces chances of growing, and I lost money where curators left a low effort review or no review at all.",2021-05-29T16:16:42.000Z,"May 29, 2021",Sam Morris Music,1,GB,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/60b247d6f9f4870a94b09689,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/60b240aadc4297001a93ce6f,Would not recommend - read my experience,would not recommend - read my experience,"I would not recommend SoundCamps for those looking for true ""organic"" promotion.From my own experience, here is my reasoning.1.

60904d7bf9f4870a6ca49347,4,SoundCampaign is legit. Its up to you to budget and work it.,"I‚Äôve been using SoundCampaign for a little over 3 months now.Here‚Äôs the deal: SoundCampaign is super legit. But you have to have good music to start with. Then you need to play with the playlist selection/genre program. And you need to be honest with yourself about what genre/band that particular song should be in. Once you lock into that, you are off to the races.If a curator doesn‚Äôt add your music, don‚Äôt get salty. There are more curators who will connect with your sound. But this is a legit platform. No robots. So, some curators may not dig your sound. Keep track of the ones you land but thank them all. They may not dig the first one, but they could dig the second track you submit.In 3 months, I have submitted 7 songs. That‚Äôs aggressive, but each song varies so they don‚Äôt all go to same curators. SoundCampaign is good like that. You are in control of the direction and budget for submissions. Out of the 7 songs submitted, I was added to a total of 52 playlists (to date). Some are same list, but many are different.NO DUDS! Depending on how specific your genre (and budget) is will determine how many followers a playlist has. SoundCampaign does a rad job of working with curators in that 1500+ follower list. I got adds to 171K, 66K, 39K, 19K and so on. So, there are some awesome playlists SC connects with.Make sure you give SC access to your Admin in your Artist Spotify account. Don‚Äôt worry, they cant add stuff to your Spotify account. They only use it to measure the data. Its good for them to see what playlists you get added to from their curators. This helps them weed out the duds and gives them better insight on which playlists to target. I also believe this will help artists with their data and theoretically, it could keep their costs reasonable.Speaking of costs, SoundCampaign is very reasonably priced for an organic playlist curator platform. There are more expensive agencies out there that don‚Äôt deliver quality curators.Remember: You probably won't be an overnight sensation. This is a marathon. Not a sprint. You need to work the curator lists and your socials and gig. Always inspect what you expect. You will see results from SoundCampaign, but the music has to be solid first.At the end of the day, you want curators to listen to your music and hopefully add it to their playlists.

602b9eab679d97052cd95c65,4,"All in all, pretty happy with the platform SoundCampaign provides","I'l start off with the positive experiences first:- The 48 hour waiting period actually allows you to get your Spotify-account in order to prepare for new listeners checking your profile. This can give you the possibility of garnering more of a following.- Most curators have playlists that have an active listenerbase, which helps in drawing in a new audience.

It seems the market is full of sharks who care about nothing but their own profit. They advertise fake promotion campaigns which simply place your music into false playlists on Spotify where robots play your music. I guess the music has and always will attract awful individuals like this. This is why the rest of us who genuinely love music have all got to look out for each other.Based on the above I can fully recommend Sound Campaign. I stumbled across the many other reviews on Trust pilot and in all honesty I was very sceptical of the glowing reviews I read. However like many other struggling artists just starting out in todays music industry I was determined to find a promoter to help me get things off the ground.I am happy to report I was very pleased with the results. I have tried a few other promoters - some which were clearly fake streams and others which gave me 2k max streams all in the USA. Also my music only got placed into a single playlist with these promoters.Sound Campaign functions very differently from this. You submit your song to them, select the genre you want to pitch the song as and then your track is pushed to multiple Spotify playlist curators who run playlists which have a decent following. It is then up to the curators whether they accept your song or not and they will give you a review of your song and explanation of why they accepted or rejected your song. It's really useful to get this feedback and such a positive aspect of using Sound Campaign.As soon as your song starts hitting a few playlists it doesn't take long before your stats start climbing up in Spotify for artists. I managed to hit 11k streams on one of my tracks promotions through Sound Campaign which is amazing. Another thing to note is that even after your promotion has ended the curators will often keep your song in their playlists for a little while afterward so your stats continue to climb which is great to see.I've also noticed that all my plays aren't just coming from the USA. I've managed to bring my music to 59 countries with Sound Campaign! It's amazing as an artist to know that your music is being heard around the world.

5f7b92c4798e6f08d4ffc762,1,Be careful! My experience has been very bad.,"Be careful. Through Soundcampaign I got on 4 playlists out of 7. They had 4.1k followers in total the one with most followers was 1500. The number of streams I got from each in the first week was less than 3 I could see this from my Spotify for artist page under playlists for my song. When I looked at the playlists my song had been added to, the number of songs and type of songs in the playlist suggested these were unlikely to be playlists with real followers. When i brought the issue up to their customer service I was dismissed and they told me this was normal and they did not take responsibility for the number of plays. Anyone who's done their research knows that a song in 3rd position on a playlist of 1500 followers would get more than 3 plays in a week. Soundcampaign should be vetting their playlists. Wheb using other similar services where I submitted my song and got selected and put on a 1500 playlist I got about 200-300 plays in that same timeframe.The fact that they were unwilling to look into the issue even when i sent them clear documentation on the matter makes me think they are just interested in collecting money and not running a good service. There are other better providers out there.As you can see from the reply I received there doesn't seem to be an understanding of the real issue. The issue is weather the playlists they are selecting offer any value to their client. If the type of playlists they offer, results in less than  3 plays, pitching a song to that kind of playlist offers no value to the artist. It is not about guaranteing plays, it's about maths. Any song that received 3 plays for a playlist of 1500 people is ridiculous. As you can see from their reply, they have absolutely no understanding of how playlists work, because otherwise they would absolutely find it alarming that a playlist with 1500 followers has less than 0.2% of that listening during the course of a week. That level of activity is clearly too low even accounting for people using shuffle mode. They should want to address this so thay they pitch to high enough quality that the plays will follow organically.

5f20be301a5a690a041a80b2,5,SoundCampaign Changed My Life üò≠,Man oh man I think this website changed my life. I have been an artist all my life from a small town and I always just needed that validity to keep me going. I didnt have much money left over but something in the back of my head told me just to go with it and everything will work out fine. I submitted my first campaign on Thursday I saw that it was to be scheduled to start on Monday and I was automatically flustered the whole weekend. Fast forward a couple of days later and I blew up overnight nothing to crazy but enough for to be forever grateful of my experience with SoundCampaign. SoundCampaign legit started my career off and I just wish I could have had this opportunity 10 years ago. You know what though it feels good to be alive and able to still chase my dreams and make things happen.
