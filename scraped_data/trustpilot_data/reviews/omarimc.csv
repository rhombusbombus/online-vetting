Working with Omari MC feels a bit like having an agent or record label to help with the excruciatingly hard (for me) business of submitting my music to playlists. I've just finished a Bronze Spotify promotion for one of my songs. And I was so pleasantly surprised by the results that I've signed up for another. One of the things that particularly drew me to Omari was that he refuses to work with music that's misogynistic or promotes violence. That really chimes with my own values. And it's good to see someone sticking to their principles like that too. I get the impression that he just honestly really loves music. His ebooks and videos are very helpful and informative.

Songs were Christian/uplifting genre which were promoted on both Utube and Spotify. Started seeing results 1-2 days after it was processed. My Spotify view went from 5 views to 1200 views over a period of two weeks . Utube views from 65 views to 1200 within 2 days still counting. Utube promotion only last up to 7 days ( for the bronze package)however so bear this in mind . I was  satisfied with their service so I used them for my 3rd single. I will use them again .

I have ordered their spotify Promo for 5 songs now and I have to say what they offer is incredible. I will say to anyone interested to be REASONABLE with your expectations. Maybe do a little testing with people to get an idea of what works first. Some songs I submitted performed better than others but even the ones that did not perform well gave me a better understanding of what aspects of my sound DO and DON'T work. They will absolutely introduce your music to a very large audience and you will get natural listens, not bots. There is a lot of potential to grow your audience with what they offer. They are also very personable. They respond to any email and any questions you might have. If you fall short of goals they will boost your promo until you hit the advertised ranges. Amazing service.

When I first saw advertisements on YouTube for OmariMC and heard that he did not promote music with profanity in it, I at first was taken aback because I thought it was a bit of an affront to creative freedoms that artists hold so dear.  But, after examining even the lines I've drawn in the sand about not promoting music that glorifies murder and various other social ills, I recognized something familiar...a person and company that holds certain things at higher value than money.  The thing that initially gave me pause when considering hiring them wound up being the very same thing that made me decide to contract them.  It was the feeling that I could trust them to stand by their word and do what they said they could do.  After using their service, I was not wrong and they delivered the results with ease.  In this business where trust and integrity are often scarce, it is refreshing to deal with a company that can figuratively look you in the eye and tell you the truth, whether it's palatable to you or not.

Some of these companies accept your songs knowing that you won't fit any of their playlists so be aware of that.  If it's a matter of their ""playlist curators choosing your song"" then your song won't fit most playlists cos they are very genre specific!  So if it's from a very distinctive genre, you may lose out.  So the company could be legit but you still never got picked.  In my opinion, they should only accept your song if they know they have the lists to accommodate your genre but they don't.",2022-10-17T14:42:40.000Z,"October 08, 2022",Withajay,5,CA,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/634d4dc09b12f67dfee36279,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5efb978ac126eaed91a43c6d

62c30789853b02c06c970860,1,It was underperformed,"I ordered the Bronze Spotify Promotion, and the song only got playlisted on 3 playlists that are Movie Soundtrack related, while my band has totally nothing to do related to those movies. Namely : Forest Gump, Juno..and My Girl. No disrespect to artists on those list, but our music - does not fit best into a playlist with (..for example:) Elvis in it. I think our song should be directed towards different kind of target listeners. Unto totally different niche. It clearly tells me, that the curators failed to put the song into proper playlists. Then, after not even 30 days yet on the list, the song was taken down by the playlist owners and totally it reached less than 300 streams (from those 3 playlists that was from Omari MC service), from what the stats reported. From my understanding, the website describes that it should reach at least 500 to 5000 streams and being included in 5 to 7 playlists. So by the end of this service the song was only made it to 3 playlists with only less than 300 streams in total.Meanwhile, through our networks of rock fans, social networks and playlisters, that same song got more streams. Our stats from Spotify for artists clearly shows it.For those reading, you can go ahead and research our song ""Rising From The Dark"" to understand the kind of music we play, and do yourself a favor by checking it out on chartmetric and/or spotontrack to see that besides those 3 playlists Omari MC could get me, the song also got to other playlist as well and got fairly decent streams.I thought by using this service, it could give the song a boost besides the effort of promo we have been doing on our own.

62aa5a5c266eedb3c15a8132,2,Know what you're getting into,"I recently used Omari for YouTube promotions. I'll preface this by saying that I don't think it's an absolutely terrible company as they will get you some form of results, and for music hobbyists that's better than nothing. However, serious customers should know what to expect when paying for expensive promotional packages and after having experience with OmariMC I feel there are both cheaper and more effective alternatives. I paid for Omari's YouTube promotion that estimated between 11,000 and 77,000 views. At the end of the promotion my song received less than 6,000 views from Omari's advertising, a painful underperformance for a high price tag. From the Omari promo I also saw that huge chunks of my views were coming from non-english speaking countries, which resulted in poor engagement numbers, high dislikes, and bad YouTube analytic data. I raised several questions with the company via email during the course of the promotion, and received relatively quick answers and temporary boosts to the results, but said results only lasted 3-4 days, not the duration of the campaign. Many of the days that my ad should've been running I received 0 views, and when I complained about my results I'd get a short boost of approximately 1,000 views from India or Italy over the course of an hour or two. After my promo package was up I decided to run my own YouTube ad, which wasn't very difficult to figure out, and received a much better subscriber-to-view ratio and like-to-view ratio for an affordable cost-per-view(approximately $0.04.) To give some context, before I ran my own ad my video had accumulated 6,500 views, 30 likes, and 9 dislikes from the Omari promo. When I created my own ad I reached 8,000 views, 65 likes, and kept my dislike count at 9. Omari sells itself as having specialized knowledge on how to run ads for genre specific music, but it needs to be said that this specialized marketing resulted in a worse overall performance than an ad I created with no previous experience with the YouTube ads platform. I've managed to offset the poor engagement I received from the Omari promo, but I'm sad that my music video had to receive all this bad, spammy data in the first place, simply because the targeting was recklessly created by OmariMC. I want to like Omari because I believe accessible music marketing companies are one of the most important tools an indie artist can have, but until their services become less sloppy, then I cannot in good faith recommend them.",2022-06-16T00:17:00.000Z,"June 16, 2022",Dave,1,US,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/62aa5a5c266eedb3c15a8132,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/62aa5a0f2e5d320012e30721

626965610c4813f76bf65712,1,Very disappointed overall,"I am rather disappointed with my experience using Omari MC. They have a policy for no explicit language in the music. This is totally fair, however my first campaign with them was cancelled as my song apparently spoke of ""illegal drugs"" when it was in reference to medication to deal with depression for a suicide awareness song. They were rather rude to deal with and no matter how much I explained what the song was about, they refused to promote it.I gave the service the benefit of the doubt and organized a second campaign for a more upbeat song. The song was approved and added to a number of playlists, however each playlist only generated a few streams at best, except one or two playlists that generated a larger number of streams. In total, the streams generated barely met the minimum number of streams they estimate from the campaign. I mentioned that I was a little disappointed with the results for the amount of money spent in the kindest way possible and the response I received was arrogant as Omari MC have the impression that they are the only organic promotion service. This is completely untrue. There are a number of great services out there offering even more organic results and much better customer service.I never leave bad reviews, but after two bad experiences with a service that brags about being the best, I feel like I need to warn people thinking about using the service. As you can see from other reviews here, they will put down your music before taking any responsibility if the results are not great. There are much better services out there so don't waste the money.*UPDATE: Their response to my review below proves my point completely. a 1,000 - 10,000 stream range is a joke and you'll barely receive the 1,000. Most of the playlists you can submit to for free and I did this before purchasing a campaign. It's hard to tell if I received any results from Omari MC. Other services actually care about their customers and will do their best to make sure customers are happy.

We recently submitted a song to OmariMC and received a message that since we used the word “damn”, they could not accept it. That was fine, although “damn” on its own is not considered an explicit lyric on all platforms in the industry. They agreed to a refund, but said there would be a fee for Palpal. I expressed that was unacceptable since it was misleading on the website. I researched prior to submitting to make sure “damn” was not explicit. After some back and forth and explaining this to them, it remained the same. Honestly you should go with a company with great customer service. Try Indie Music Academy. They have been so in-depth and have really taken care of us as customers. Their services are wonderful, and their customer service is amazing. Two other wonderful companies way more worth your money is Planetary Group (PR and playlisting as well) and Starlight PR.You’ll see their reply below, but it still does not address these concerns. What I told them is that their website is misleading. Explicit content when it comes to music is very specific. It is not out of the ordinary to assume “no explicit content” means exactly what those standards would be, especially a from a company that is pitching music to the industry that has those exact standards. In addition, the word “damn”, among other words commonly used in the English language, is not always considered a “curse” word (I.e. why the music industry does not consider it explicit content).  I also told them, I recommend that they update their website to inform their customers that their ideas of “explicit content” does not line up with the “explicit content” by music industry standards, and then go into detail what those differences are (I.e. the word “damn” not being allowed). Only then will I believe they are being fair to their customers and not misleading them.

All three songs achieved the streams they suggested possible for the tier of service I paid for. What was impressive was they made sure of it by being willing to follow up and re pitch my songs if the songs maybe didn’t get initially picked by their curators. This illuminated two things to me, that they truly are seeking organic streams and also the company really does their best to see your music find an audience which is great. Especially as an independent producer of Christian and Gospel music that hasn’t always been a given when shopping for promotional services. One knock on them I guess is that when I submitted Christmas music they told me they don’t really have Christmas playlists on Spotify to pitch to and recommended I pitch the song on YouTube instead. While I really wanted the song campaign to be on Spotify I appreciate they were up front about what they could do. And to their credit the song got the views on YouTube they said it would.

So far on my first campaign (Bronze Spotify Promotion/R&B and Hip-Hop genre for my song Loveolution), they have placed my music on Spotify playlists that are appropriate. I still have to ask them to interpret the results, but so far so good. I've gotten on 3x's more playlists than they guaranteed.What really separates them is their honesty. The first song I released as an artist had some engineering issues. It was my first time around so I didn't realize the issues until my distributor mentioned it. I submitted this song to Omari MC anyway and they said they couldn't push it because of the sound quality. They offered my money back or a credit. They could have just taken the money, but they actually listened and turned the song down. With Loveolution, they listened and questioned a lyric that they thought contained profanity. Once I indicated it wasn't profane, they began to push it.Omari MC is the real deal and I will continue using them.

61d8a78ca16c1e751f626fa6,1,Didn't even get half their low end estimate,"They promised 500-1000 listens and provided less than 200. Not surprisingly because, as expected, they just put you on random playlists no one listens to. One playlist netted a whole 1 listen. The highest play count on any playlist was about a dozen. There's no confusing this. If thousands were subscribed to their playlists id have hit their target even if everyone person hated my song. More likely, they create the playlists you're submitting to and if anyone at all listens its other suckers who applied. Avoid at all costs.Edit: they claim they cannot guarantee results because, to be fair, your music might not be that good. Let's assume mine sucks and no one wants to hear it. That should generate more than a single listener, even if by accident. The problem is they're submitting your music to playlists no one listens to. Who makes these playlists? I can only assume they do. I was added to a playlist called ""cardio workout."" Not sure why, not that the song is appropriate for that, but I couldn't even find the playlist in a spotify search. Another I was added to was ""rock gaming music you'll love."" It has 960 likes lol. Another was literally called ""playlist1"" with a whopping 28 likes. In total I was added to 10 playlists. Half of which had plays in single digits. One hit 89 plays, nothing else came remotely close to that, with the runner up coming in at 16 plays (playlist had about 4k likes). I've been licensed by MTV and Red Bull in the past, so let's assume that even if you don't like my music it's not the worst ever recorded. This service, if you want to call it that, is clearly awful. Save your money. For what they charge you could hire a legit PR firm to get you actual results. If they're vetting these playlists thats actually somehow more pathetic.Also, as evident by my super long review, I've wasted enough time.... sp I won't be chasing more plays with Omari lol.",2022-01-21T21:22:49.000Z,"January 07, 2022",Jonathan Hayes,2,US,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/61d8a78ca16c1e751f626fa6,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/61d8a780cda34b0012fcad1b

61d7d5d4a16c1e751f618d6f,1,A camouflaged scam,"I enlisted Omari on a trial basis to determine how legit their playlist pitch service is when it comes to spotify. The company claims that it will pitch your song to x number of playlists with no guarantee as to how many will add your song and no guarantee of how many spins it will get. This is both true and false. X, of course, is determined by how much you pay for the service. More pay for the promo, more playlists they pitch to. Makes business sense, especially the way they do it.Omari will get you some spins. Those spins will be based on how much you pay. But the algorithm to locate your song for anyone searching for similar music will be screwed. Omari clearly has a group of playlists that they place your song in and when the campaign expires, all of the playlists drop it that day. That was the final clue I needed to determine that I will not use the service again. Other clues were the playlists that my song ended up in. A number of them made no sense for the song's subject matter or genre. (Sad country song about spending the last bit of time with a father figure finding its way into a Forest Gump Soundtrack playlist)(at least try to hide it...)Moral of the story: you will get some spins. They don't mean anything. The cost of the service will not return anywhere near the amount of spins needed to pay itself off and since these spins and playlists end the day your payment runs out, that's all there is. There are no residual spins because ALL of the playlists drop you immediately. Good luck.Edited to add: $147 campaign didn't even reach their base of 1,000 streams. Missed that mark by close to 300.Reply:I'll send you the proof for missing the mark. Hexk, you can look at the overall numbers today and see the song still isn't at 1000. This confirms the ROI argument. Your company does not create organic growth. It creates a boost in spins during the time of the campaign and then ends. Just because you've got people on the payroll in different cities playing through the playlists doesn't make it legit. Technically, those are not bots, but technically, those are not organic either.As I said, I will send your proof, but as I stated in my email, I don't want to the campaign extended. I don't trust your company. Either refund or refuse, but Please DO NOT EXTEND THE CAMPAIGN.

The playlists are as random as ""The edge of boy band"" (I am a female singer songwriter) ""Romantic songs"" when the song is clearly a danceable track, and so forth.

Yes! ME: zero music marketing experience, I was able to get way better results for my song than this ""reputable"" company who charged me 150 USD to basically do NOTHING.After a lot of emails back and forth and this whole thing being an obvious underperformance, they said that they would be willing to issue a partial refund.

61b784de0b7cbbcbfe0b4d48,2,Updated review,"Just to update my review, after my first experience (which was a small Spotify campaign that cost me $77) I got a fantastic response and I was very happy. This prompted me to engage a second campaign and I paid $147. However this second time was not quite as stellar as the first, in fact it seemed to have the opposite effect and my plays just kept diminishing. I emailed Omari about a week before Christmas and they said they were on vacation and they will get on it, which I said no problem to. Well, here we are now, just a week shy of the end of my campaign and nothing, nada. Very disappointing, and needless to say I will not be using again.",2022-01-04T17:38:52.000Z,"December 13, 2021",Paul,2,US,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/61b784de0b7cbbcbfe0b4d48,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/61b784c82094440012178911

My first campaign was the Gold Spotify Organic Promotion plan, and OmariMC delivered results as promised (27 playlist placements resulting in over 4,000 streams so far). My second campaign, the Platinum Spotify Promotion plan, has not concluded yet, but I am on track to meet my goals (currently 25 placements through OmariMC, with ~3,300 streams so far - ~5,000 streams was advertised as the low end of the typical results, but as I said, my campaign is still running and I am on track to at least meet that minimum stream goal). I can say that Spotify has not removed my music, so I know these streams are legit. Some of the placements admittedly seem a bit random (i.e. ""Russian party Hits"" for a US House Producer, lol), but the streams are being delivered and they are legitimate.

Dont expect any saves or follows after this “organic” promotion.

They eventually added a handful of extra playlists that resulted in a few thousand listens (total for three tracks)  Decided to give them another try with three more tracks, but even worse results.  They used the same stale playlists with little to no traffic, and again I had to make multiple requests to better target the music to lists that weren't geared toward ""running"" In the end it took up way to much of my time to constantly E-mail them back and forth and send screenshots to get just subpar results.

They offer free advice on youtube all the time, information that is real and they are here to actually provide real information.  I've been in the business for over 10 years and a lot of this stuff was not available when i started.  And although i am an established independent artist that make a full time living off music, i like companies like omaris because they actually will help you up your game and take things to another level.  My goal is to get my funnels and overall brand up to a million a year.  Yes that is my goal and I see it happening.  I take a lot of different courses and masterclasses from many different places , so i can be a witness that omari mc is offering the real deal stuff.  For any of you who complain and don't want to put in the work and expect something overnight, yea don't waste your money , but for those of you who are serious about your business, take advantage of all the info omari mc gives and get their information, pay for coaching.  you're better off with that than streams.  Spotify IS NOT the primary place for people to get discovered.  spotify is a RESULT of your work that you've put in elsewhere.  You're better off spending your money on coaching and getting help to build your brand, your business.  You all should be having an active email list and engage your fan base and your customers.  If you had just 100 people who spent 100 dollars in a year, that's 10,000.  Stop thinking small and start thinking about your careers long term.  I don't want to say my name on here, but my career is popping.  I have some major publications that are coming out including forbes, rollin stone and billboard in which i'm in all of those coming up.  So i know what i'm talking about.  Learn the MUSIC BUSINESS from omari mc.  Pay for the coaching. The information they are telling you is real.  I normally don't write reviews, but i'm sick of these artist who are lazy and don't want to put in the work.  You just want to get streams just to validate your ego.  Look, if your song is really popping yea they will leave you on the playlist longer.  I tried omari before, and even though they say it can fall off after 2 to 4 weeks, it is STILL ON THE PLAYLIST EVERY SINCE APRIL.  With constant real streams.  no FAKE BUFFALO CITY streams.  All you have to do is go to a profile and look at the city.  If the numbers are realistic you know its real.  100 from this place, 100 from that.  None of omari stuff say thousands from buffalo.  Thats how you know its real.  So take this priceless information in this review.  Build your email list.  Build your website.  Stop expecting a handout.  I put 16 hours a day multiple days a week into building my brand, hoaning my craft and its paying off.  All you have to do is be realistic and put in your time and it will pay off.  Trust me it will.  So it's time to act like business people and get the information that will help you.  Get business info from omari ASAP.  Pay them for coaching.  Do what you need to do to get that right mindset so that you can think like a business person.   And keep in mind that number i gave you.  100 people paying 100 per year is 10K.  that's like a part time job.  And if you can get a 100, then you can get to a 1000 people.  There's over 7 billion people on this planet, you only need a drop to make a living.  So open up your mind and start getting the info that you need.

I did research on the top 10 promotion sites for spotify and youtube. Based on reviews I decided to give it a try. So far I have done 2 spotify promotion campaigns, and a youtube music video campaign. THEY DO WHAT THE PROMOTION SAYS THEY ARE GOING TO DO. EACH PROMOTION GIVES A RANGE OF WHAT TO EXPECT FOR STREAMS/VIEWS. EACH PROMOTION OPTION IS DIFFERENT AND YES, THE MORE YOU PAY, THE LONGER PROMOTION=HIGHER RESULTS. I got the amount of streams advertised for Spotify, and my views and subscribers skyrocketed on my youtube videos. The spotify streams have taken much longer. But that's why is says organic promotion? It's not going to go viral overnight. Yes, when you reach the promised range of views/streams, your promotion ends. They pull the advertisement/playlist. Other companies told me they couldn't ""promise anything"" based on my budget. At least you get what you pay for here.

60f6bf0df9f48709d4b9d0ab,1,"Sketchy (probably fake) Results, terrible customer support","It started with me requesting a silver YouTube campaign, with a rush (which is what I normally ask for). I got the confirmation that the order was processed a day later, and I was expecting to start seeing my views increase 1-2 days later. After 4 days, I still hadn't seen any results whatsoever. The views I got on the video were very low. I emailed support, and Taylor responded, saying that the ad was moving to a crawl, and he changed some of the configurations on the promo. He told me I should start seeing results within a day, but to email him 3 days later if I still hadn't seen any change. 3 days later, there's no change. I email him again. This time, he punts me to Jaron, their marketing manager. 7 hours later, I get this from Jaron: ""Hi, I have made adjustments for your campaign. Talk soon, Jaron"". That's it, no details as to what went wrong, no apology, no insight as to when things should improve, or how confident he was that he actually found the problem. Seemed to me like he had no idea what to do. Turns out, I was right. I responded asking for more details. He told me my ad had ""stalled"" and that he increased the CPV and adjusted keywords. I responded by thanking him and asking if I could at least get a credit for the rush option I paid for, given this was a week and a half after I placed the initial request, and the campaign should already be done by now. Furthermore, I didn't ask for a refund, I asked them to give me a free rush on the next campaign I was going to pay for a few days later (This is a $17 value, and at this point in the year, I've used them for over $2K in promos - not exactly a demanding request). He responded by saying: ""Our rush order only pertains to us replying to and accepting the promotion within 24 business hours. However, as a gesture of good faith I will honor your request"". Note still no apology, or any indication that they took accountability for the problem. 4 days later, I had to email him again, saying it still wasn't fixed, I asked him if maybe the campaign wasn't placed correctly from the start. At this point, Jaron responds with: ""This should allow for the campaign to run successfully. It is not always an issue of the campaign being set up correctly or incorrectly. There are a lot of varying factors when it comes to running successful campaigns as the market/competition is always evolving."" He also tells me that in the two weeks since I placed the request, the number of views from their service was 75. That was his way of telling me the campaign was ""working"", but it needed ""tweaking"" (his words). Think about that. Based on this explanation, it's ""normal"" to see campaigns underperform so significantly. These things can happen whenever the market fluctuates. I had to monitor it myself and contact support so that Omari would look at it. That means that if you pay for a campaign, you could get the thousands of views they promise you, or you could get 75... and if YOU don't notice it, or if you're running multiple promo campaigns and don't see that the Omari campaign isn't working, they won't do anything about it pro-actively. So you can't trust their service. What happened next was very interesting. Within the span of 60 minutes, the video got 2200-2300 views in one shot, and then it completely stopped. What's even weirder is that out of those views, I didn't get a single subscriber, or even a like (or comment). I realize that the campaign doesn't guarantee subscribers. That's not my issue. I have about 800 subscribers and about 70,000 views in total since the start of my channel. That means 1 in 87.5 views generate a subscriber (on average). While the results can vary, let's simply agree that 0 subscribers on 2200 views is just not realistic. It's a clear sign of fake views. It's been 24 hours since thes 2200 views and the numbers stalled again completely. I've paid over $160 for this promo, I've gotten a fraction of the views they tell you you're getting, and I'm not getting any legitimate help from their customer support, who doesn't want to acknowledge that they screwed up somewhere. The sad part is up until now, I planned on using them as a key part of my marketing strategy when it comes to YouTube, but now, I wouldn't use them again even if it was free. Nathaniel, what's the point of doing all of this add-value stuff like publishing advice for content creators on your YouTube channel, when you can't deliver on your core products, and have a crappy support team. I thought you were smarter than that.Update: So Jaron, how do you explain the 2200 views in a single hour and then a total stop. Google ads doesn't work that way. And why is it that you still haven't fixed it... Maybe don't end your reply with ""we always deliver the expected result"" when it's simply not true.",2021-07-21T18:54:40.000Z,"July 20, 2021",Jean Lamoureux,3,CA,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/60f6bf0df9f48709d4b9d0ab,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/60afefe9968cc9001a07574f

60e61489f9f48702a8938907,1,Too expensive for the service,"Too expensive for the service. A Spotify stream is 0.0034 dollars paid to an artist account. If you have a curator charging above 50 dollars per playlist per month you’re just wasting your money. Especially when you cannot tell if the streams are real or notEdit ✍️: listen Omarimc, what you’re saying is false. Ok let’s do the math Your cheapest campaign is bronze spotify: 77 USD (estimated 500-5000 plays). Let’s say I purchased this and got 5000 plays which is usually not the case. Plus you must factor in bots which I’m not sure if you’re a big player in the industry, 😉)…multiply 5k streams with 0.0034 and thats 17 dollars even. There is ZERO MARKETING SENSE in investing 77 dollars to recoup 17 dollars. The campaign runs 2-4 weeks because “curators need to keep their playlists fresh”. So if I keep investing 77 dollars per month what’s the sense in that. Also you say there should be other streams of income… and you’ve explained it. With other streams of income like merch and tours the artist still has to invest time and effort to get those done and your sham service does nothing to help with that. ZERO STARS… independent artists please find digital marketing experts who can organically automate ads for you on Facebook and YouTube to grow your brand… don’t waste time on fictitious campaignsUpdate: FRUSTRATION? ...not at all. Far from it. In fact your assumptions are based on YOU beating around the bush. I am loving the process. What is actually frustrating is the amount of fake playlisters out there destroying careers and stealing money from unknowing people. I ask you AGAIN... please explain the smart business sense in a promotion that costs 70 USD and returns 17 USD. And as for your free course, please relax...you're not selling anything informative out there. (Go and watch Revolt summit or Spectacular Slims YouTube channel, and you will get a better idea)Check my ASOS review out...they sell quality apparel on a budget. QUALITY i.e. value for money.I am not pointing the finger at everybody else. ONLY Fake curator companies that sell bogus products and non existent streams. You are lucky Spotify does not have the power to audit you. You know the outcomeP.S. I have spent 1000 USD on Facebook ads and I have gotten results. They are not what I want yet but they are leading me in the right direction. For instance, followers are real, very real (close to 10k). Also my insights are through the roof (1.5 Million reach, 2.3 million impressions, 8k link clicks, 670,000 3 second plays and 47k post reactions) Just so you know that I know what I am saying and where I am headed.

But PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. Explain to the people here how 70$ spend on a campaign with you that yields 17$ ROI is worth the while. Granted you’ve spent millions on ads. So what’s your issue with my review. Just keep it chill and accept it as it is and move on.

It saved me money and got me more plays- a winning situation! They're very clear up front that the song you're promoting must be 1) good quality 2) clean.

I recently tried their basic pricing tier for Spotify and the results were absolutely amazing! My artist, Nick Michigan who is a singer songwriter and creates a unique blend of R&B, Funk, Jazz and Pop music, had a very small number of monthly listeners and low streaming activity on Spotify. However, after using Omari Promotion, there has been an increase of 687 monthly listeners within a couple of weeks bringing streams up 90%!!! Also, the promoted songs by Nick Michigan have been added to at least 31 playlists making it possible for more potential fan reach and more sales. These are real playlists that are listened to by real people that give you real results. No bots!! Their pricing for what they offer is very reasonable especially when compared to other companies and it seems that the results are much faster.

I can say if you use the first tier of his Spotify services coupled with your own Spotify playlisting efforts you will be alright if your trying to spike the algorithm.

I read the terms and they said they could not promise a certain number of streams like in Spotify, which is ok but I didn't expect that few!8 playlists they put it in and only 7 streams for three weeks? I'm not even sure if there was a change in the amount of streams i usually got. But hey, It's Apple so I decided to give it a little more time and try their spotify basic promotion. ""Basic for 77 USD"" doesn't sound basic to me but ok. I sent the link of a different song and got a reply that they couldn't understand the lyrics, which was odd but I understood it. I sent the lyrics and took some time to reply, which is fine. I wanted them to their job. They later on replied with the same generic response they did for my apple promotion ""Thanks for sending! The song was well done overall. Good production, engineering, and delivery."" Then almost immediately I received an email saying that they changed their mind and now my song is not up their standards and asking me if I have another one. Took me as a surprise but I said, ok and sent the same song they did apple promotion for. Then they said that that song wasn't up to their standards either. I told them that they already had promoted that song for other service and they went silent. No refund, no promotion, nothing.I felt that the problem was that the person that was handling that promotion was either setting ridiculous personal standards or didn't use good enough headphones because the song is already popular in Spotify.I also was requested by the OMARI team to leave a review. I really wish I could've given a better review than this but the actions speak volumes. I don't think they are ill-intent.

Additionally, the majority of the playlists didn't even match the aesthetic/vibe of the songs, I make dark rnb/rap and I was put on Hip Hop Gaming, Hip Hop Hype, Workout Hip Hop, some of the playlists made marginal sense but they were the smaller scale playlists and my first days on the ones I actually wanted to be on, my tracks were in the middle/towards the bottom of them... It just seemed like they were thrown in to a bunch of playlists without any thought just so they met the quota of listeners I payed to be exposed to.

609975b9f9f487069cf09b58,4,You get what you pay for... song streams,"First time user with Omari MC, positive feedback so far.  Very easy website to use and straightforward language so that you know exactly what you are getting out of the deal.  Pretty quick response from Omari as well.  I've dealt with plenty of swindlers and scammers over the past 2 years but Omari seems like a legit, honest person and does not seem to be trying to take advantage of anyone.  After 2 years of using Submit Hub, Daily Playlists, Soundplate, and DMs on Instagram, this is the first time I actually had any real success with playlist placements and a significant uptick in streams.  However, a word of caution to newbies, playlist placement is not the same thing as gaining followers.  Many of these playlists do what Omari promises and that is to give you song streams but many of these playlists (at least the ones my songs were on) are just background tracks, chill music, study music, etc.  The kind of playlists that people just put on and don't pay attention to.  These types of playlists won't give you many followers because they may not be the type of listeners that are interested in your specific genre.  After a month or so when your song is pulled, your streams may dwindle back down towards zero.  You need followers to maintain any long-term momentum that you can actually build a career on.  There is no real quick solution to growing your followers other than the tired old grind that is the music biz so don't get your hopes too high.  Of course, that is just my limited experience but in the future I need to consider how to invest more time and energy into playlists that are more likely to produce an active reaction, visits to my profile, follows, etc.",2021-05-10T18:04:41.000Z,"May 10, 2021",Zane Kratzer,1,US,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/609975b9f9f487069cf09b58,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/609975a8910779001a949f90

Honestly, any package he offers works, and I know because by trying Omari MC out, I got the smallest package he offers just to test the waters, and were COMPLETELY  satisfied with the results: multiple playlist placements and hundreds of streams and monthly listeners.

So i did a buch of research on a lot of these services and this is the only company that actually called me back and was really straight up with me. This is a monthly service, so you need to promote your music each month. I highly recommend them, your not going to see fake and unrealistic streams, plus that defeats the overall purpose of using a service like this. You want real, bona fide streams and followers. However I can't stress this enough, this is a monthly service, so set aside money each month to invest in this if your serious about your music, your career and most of all... you! This is an investment and like any investment great results don't happen overnight, it takes time, patients and hard work.

There are also Youtube subscriptions, which confirms that they are authentic. Authentic views was one of my concerns. My track has also been placed on about 50 Spotify playlists.

608ffaa9f9f4870a786ce2c5,5,It's been a good experience so far,"It's been a good experience so far. I started my first campaign at the $150 range (can't remember exact amount). My track got into 18 playlists and is currently my 2nd most popular track now. It seems like it's organic streams and saves. Even got a couple followers so far. This is about growing your fan base, growing your reach over time, not about getting an initial ROI. It's not a sprint. You could to have your track posted to thousands of playlists, and it may get 100,000 plays. But the amount of money to do that would be significant (well into the thousands?) and the revenue  from the streams alone would be $250? (I'm not sure how much you get per stream). So personally I wouldn't spend a lot of money unless you're certain your track will get traction, because it's just that good. But most people cannot discern this, and think that they deserve the plays even if it's not that good. Some people just think they're stuff is the best thing in the world and have blinders on. You need to be honest with yourself and realistic. Accept criticism and critique from others as well.  Just because you get your track in front of people, doesn't mean your career will change. You need to make sure the music is worthy of people's time. Even a great production doesn't guarantee that. It's about much more than that.

This has really helped me to better understand how to make my YouTube work most efficiently.So, far I'm very happy with the YouTube promotion, and have already passed the minimum threshold for expected views. One thing I appreciate about OmariMC is that he is not afraid to give recognition to his competitors when he talks about best practices and the top promotional services. Even if such recommendations may result in his losing a sale. I have actually used some of his recommended competitors.

So that was my first impression and I rrquested them to please send the song to lists that matched the genre as the reason I am doing this is to get new fans and followers, I am nto interested in fake numbers in my account.2- I decided to listen to track by track, just to give a chance that maybe some music matched mine, bt to my surprise, I found the same songs repeated over and over in all the lists and almost in the same sequence. So, what are the odds that all those curators liked exactly the same songs (I have screenshots to prove what I am talking about)feel free to check those lists by yourself and confirm that they all have almost the same songs:lists:	Best Workout Playlist 2021Workout Music You'll Love 2021 Gaming Music You'll Love 2021 Undiscovered Rock 2021 and so on, you can see even the names follow a pattern.Before I noticed this the treatment was very polite and good, but once I started to ask questions, the communication stopped, so I requested them to please refund my money, stop the ""campaign"" and remove my song from the lists as I am even worried to be blocked by Spotify, and as expected no more answer.I am expecting this clever guy to reply to my complaint with a clever excuse, as I have seen him giving to everyone else who complained, and I hope I can reply to that in order to unmask them.if you just want your numbers to go up, this can work, but what they are selling are orgqanic lists and I can tell that is not what they do and I would doubt the followers of those lists are for real.Avoid this, dont waste 400 USD as I did, be smarter than me.Edit:you all can see he replies here but not on his email... avoid this guy!",2021-04-28T18:36:24.000Z,"April 28, 2021",Luis Canela,5,GB,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6089921af9f4870984ae55d8,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/60193ed52020b2001907c9d5

6040e40af85d75064c374adf,4,This is my second review,"This is my second review of the Omari services. My genre is typically singer songwriter. The first time, I said that Omari does what it promises. I still stand by that. Don't get your hopes up too high though, because my Spotify campaigns only generated about 1500 to 2000 streams (and a considerable number of saves) per song. This does not apply to my YouTube campaigns, however, because they ended up higher (even up to 6000), with the necessary new followers on my YouTube channel as well. Meanwhile, I can somewhat compare Omari with Playlist Push. With the latter, I spent a lot more money for a Spotify campaign, which resulted in a lot less streams. Playlist Push does give you serious feedback from playlist curators. But if it turns out that a large majority of the curators found my song very good (with arguments), but - despite my critical choise of playlist genres - not suitable for their playlist, you wonder if the pitch of Playlist Push is really adequate. In my case it is not. In that respect, Omari scores better. My experience with Omari is that sometimes - especially in YouTube campaigns - they are a little sloppy about tapping into enough target locations which can slow the performance down. You have to pay close attention to that.

I got the basic package for Spotify promo for my pop-rock/indie pop song. I recommend sending over the lyrics when ordering just to be safe since they only promote clean music. My only complaint with the service was that I had to follow up with them after 2 weeks because it seems that after I sent them my lyrics, my song/email just got left on the backburner and promotion was never started on the song.But ignoring that snafu, once promo started I was very impressed. While I was surprised my pop-rock song was being added to Rap/Hip Hop playlists, I emailed the team and within a day my song was being added all over the place to workout, high energy, and feel good playlists. My song doubled in saves during the month of promotion, and even now, is still on all the playlists despite the promo starting over a month ago. While the estimate for this package starts around 500 plays, my song is near 1000 at this point.I look forward to using their services again in a few weeks for my next song.

60310298f85d7509d8df015f,1,"Resulted in distributor freezing account for ""fraudulent streaming""","I have used only Omari MC for Spotify because of its promise of organic promotion. My first campaign was in summer 2019. It was not originally bad: a single 150k placing would steadily get me 150 saves (better than nothing for my genre), and these tracks are still listened now giving 15 streams per month per track meaning those were genuine listeners. However recently (late 2020 when my last campaign started) everything changed. The same playlist I relied on before gave me 5-10 times fewer plays, while new playlists they started to use resulted in an unusually high number of plays with 750 saves. Sounds great; the only issue was that last month there was not a single play from those 750 saves. And during the promotion I got 500 more followers, but exactly on the day the promotion ended, instead of flattening the followers started to drop until every single one of those 500 disappeared. This was a clear evidence there were fake plays used, and these were used by their playlists, not some independent ones (as they claimed) since those had just a score of streams and did not remove the track on the same day as their playlists. I complained, they said they vet all playlists for organic growth, after this fake pays/followers did not repeat. But it was too little too late: Even before the whole 4 track campaign ended, my music distributor took down all my albums, freezing my account and accusing me in ""fraudulent streaming"" to my utter  distress (I struggled to eat for 2 weeks after that as it was so shocking and unfair).UPDATE: I have read your reply:1. All my tracks are still there since I moved the distributor immediately after the previous one took down all albums. So it took 2 days to restore all tracks. I managed to restore statistics on Spotify, but on Deezer I lost all album fans. All statistics show a 1-2 days fall to 0. I can forward you the email from my previous distributer if you do not believe me.2. The fact that my track appeared on another playlist does not explain why fake followers started to drop on the day my campaign with you ended and not on any other day. If the fake follower were coming from a 3rd party playlist, then their dynamics would have not correlated with your campaign at all. The same refers to the 750 of fake saves which stopped increasing on the same day my campaign ended.3. You said Spotify removed fake playlists, but the playlist in your link is still there, so it must not be fake.4. Even not considering the fake playlist, the ""Desire"" campaign did not seem produce any results in contrast to other campaigns, so not a single stream  from listeners own playlists during last month apart from someone I know in Japan.So I am afraid, everything points at your playlists as responsible for fake plays and my trouble.",2021-02-20T19:20:08.000Z,"February 20, 2021",Alexander Vilchinskiy,15,GB,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/60310298f85d7509d8df015f,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5069a058000064000122ef38

602c7d85679d9708b4d8a852,5,"Spotify playlisting service is top notch, but could use some tweaking.","We have used Omari several times to promote our EDM artist from our label.  We started out using the most inexpensive package as a test to see if Omari was legit.  And we have determined that this service IS LEGIT. Listen, promoting a new artist or starting out as a new artist is hard and getting a following is even more difficult.  Omari does what he says.  He gets songs on playlists.   In our experience we have received plays, song saves and some subscribers.   We have used the service a couple of times for the same artist...  on each occasion the songs were placed on the same playlists with the same themes.. which I was not impressed by.  I was hoping for new playlists with maybe new themes to reach a new audience.  I am not saying they didnt do the job, its just the playlists themselves had a wide variety of music genres on them and that our tracks may not have fit with all of the songs on the playlist that the song was on.  Having said that, some of the smaller playlists the song appeared on were more targeted toward the dance/edm genres which offered us less plays but more targeted listeners.   The playlists are real.  The listeners are real.   That's important.  My only critique is that sometimes the songs land on massive playlists with lots of followers but there are so many songs on the playlist that getting a decent amount of plays can be hard to come by over 2-3 week period.  Just because you have playlist with 20k followers doesnt mean they are listening to every song.  Remember, lots of people use the shuffle feature so its possible that your song may not even get played to them.  Also I doubt all 20k people are listening to that playlist during that 2-3 week period.  So while this is a great service, it can be improved by more targeted playlists with fewer songs and more listeners.   Kind of hard to come by these days on Spotify.  But in the end we come back to Omari because A) His service is honest.  B) We realize that it takes awhile to build an audience for a new artist, it wont happen over night and getting lots of song saves and being playlisted on personal playlists have definitely come from Omari's promotions.  C) He does not use BOTS...  Beware of services offering 5000+ plays on your track.  Its not real.  I'd rather have 100 real listeners liking the track and putting it in their playlist and telling their friends then fake bots playing tracks to up the play count.   Spotify's algorithm wont pick up the plays and suggest the track to others because the people who are playing the tracks are fake accounts who listen to 20 different genres of music.  D) Omari is Christian...  I would rather do business with a Christian..than with someone who is lying to me. For a Christian to base his entire business around lies would mean he is not a Christian in the first place.  So we trust that he is doing the job he says he is... If he were lying then I'd say eventually the truth would be revealed.  We have used a ton of different promotional companies to promote different styles of music on Spotify.  Most are fake or yield horrible results.  Omari yields results.  Is his service expensive?  Yes.  Will you get on playlists?  Yes.  Will you get followers?  That all depends on how good your music is and if you're on the right playlist.  Will you get plays?  Yes.   Will you get song saves?   Depends on how good your music is.   Will you go viral and be the next big thing?  Probably not.  But if you look into the other promotional companies around today, they are either stealing  your money or simply cannot compete with Omari's service.   We have yet to use his services for anything other than Spotify.  So I cannot comment on his other services.  Our recommendation is that you give this service a shot.  Look at the playlists you are on.  See how many plays you get from these playlists.  Keep notes.  And judge for yourself.

From my personal experience, I would suggest his promotions to anyone, you can talk to him always, he is always ready to help out if you are curious about anything, and is always honest.

Since 2017, we have toured extensively throughout Canada and the US gaining new fans along the way. When the Covid pandemic hit, it became very difficult to reach new audiences as touring became obsolete.  We decided to inquire about a promotion agency as a way to help distribute our music to a wider audience.  After reading many positive reviews, we decided to give Omari MC a try.  We purchased the bronze Spotify campaign ($77) for our song titled ‘Something Good’ and within 48 hrs we had been awarded 7 playlists in the Country rock genre.  The pitch lasted for about 3 weeks and we jumped from having only 26 streams to over 1.5 streams.

60273ee6679d97052cd6593a,5,Brick Casey's Omari MC Services Testimonial,"Peace and Blessings to you all. My name is Brick Casey, an independent artist who had really good results with Omari MC promotion services.To start, as many are, I too were a bit uncertain in paying for music promotion, (mostly out fear of Omari MC's services being a scam of some sort. Yet in realizing that to successfully market your music - YOU NEED PROMOTION (and a budget).As a multi-genre producer I found that Omari MC differentiates itself from the myriad of promo companies in that they, (Omari MC), doesn't simply take any and all money - which meant to me that the Omari MC marketing team has standards aka integrity. That's when I knew that this marketing company was for me, (as I hold a high regard of respect and integrity in my craft, and I like to surround myself with like-minded parties).In short, I ordered a Spotify Bronze Promo Package, (not expecting much as again I was a bit leery).Within 1 days I went from 5 to 25 followers. The stream count went from 2 to 56 and made 9 playlists all on this one account, (as I manage a couple of artists).To those who may not find this to be exciting news, I say simply look at the exponential metrics. With the least investment towards Omari MC's services, I was able to have organic growth in 7 day spread than I have had WITHOUT the service. (To me; it's simply smart business ethics to employ a reliable marketing company).That's why I've decide to revisit Omari MC for marketing services as well as write this review. For one I dont believe I was scammed in anyway and it's (Omari MC), an upstanding company that delivers. So as an artist it's only right that I share my experience with Omari MC to in some way set the record straight about any misconceptions about the company, (because trust me - I did my homework and a large part of my skepticism hinged on what Omari MC's competitors were saying about them).Yes I've also tried other companies prior and I found that at the end of the day if you as an artist are serious about your craft then you at some point will have to sit down and answer se hard questions about your marketing  campaigns. In closing I give a 5 Star review for two reason...1. Omari MC delivers results with its services.2. Omari MC is affordable, efficient and extremely resourceful as a marketing entity. My #LTR for this company is an absolute yes; I'm likely to recommend this company outright anytime for any artist who is looking to grow their fan base and expand their audience.Sincerely,Brick Casey",2021-02-13T02:52:22.000Z,"February 13, 2021",Brick Casey,1,US,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/60273ee6679d97052cd6593a,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/60273ee0873042001be8fc4d

So all signs that there was real people listening. The save/ listener/ stream ratio All seemed in line with nothing untoward and spread over many different cities although predominantly US. The Apple promotion was much lower in numbers than Spotify don’t know if that’s just what you get with Apple Music. The you tube was a bit more of a quick rise in views then fell away to nothing over the promotion period with a few comments left so not sure how genuine the results were in terms of real interested people viewing.

I heard of this company through one of my previous engineers named Chevy Jordan (Recording Engineer/Photographer/Videographer) and said that they promote clean music! I make clean music ONLY and because of Omari, I'm starting to get the right exposure I need for my type of music.  I've been continuously investing in Omari because the organic exposure that I now have has gotten me on Discover Weekly, and other algorithmic playlists on Spotify.  For a side note,  When I look at my spotify artists app and look at where my traffic is coming from, it isn't just from playlists. It's from algorithmic playlists as well as ""other"" sources. If you make clean music, Omari is most definitely the place to promote your stuff. I know for a fact that this is real because I haven't seen a lot of these promotion companies offer Facebook ads to be ran on your songs. Facebook ads aren't guaranteed a ton of likes and comments, but they are guaranteed exposure and new fans of YOUR music will find out about you and share your content!

I hadn't even used any other promo services, strategies or advertising.I kindly asked for a refund and they accusations ""it wasn't our fault it was yours"" continued.

5ff38b28755dc107e0d71881,1,"I Ordered The $1,800 Spotify Package Twice","One of the biggest regrets of my life: I used this service twice, maxing out at the highest available payment option, for two different genres of songs (pop and hip-hop) during two different periods of time (January 2020 and July 2020). Unfortunately, both focus groups had the same results. You’ll get an initial inflation of plays, monthly listeners, and saves, however when the promotion ends and the playlist curators remove your song, your numbers will plummet to near-zero (with the exception of the quantity of plays, of course). In my experience, bots are most likely to blame for this. In my case, for both songs, the monthly listeners increased to 20K-30K and the saves increased to 1K-2K, then, almost as if someone flipped a switch, my monthly listeners and favorites plummeted to almost exactly where I was before the campaign (around 1K monthly listeners and 10-20 saves per song). Monthly listeners (and especially saves) are supposed to slowly taper, not plummet - and especially not back down to where the song was before the campaign started. Keep in mind that the 2 songs that I chose to promote aren’t pieces of trash that I whipped up in my bedroom (or else I’d expect the numbers to plummet, because who would want to listen to them?). Both songs were professionally recorded, mixed and mastered in Nashville, with a variety of songwriters attached to each song. With a mainstream-sounding pop and hip-hop song being promoted, you’d expect some type of traction with this level of Spotify promotion package from Omari. This company really needs to flush out these third-party, botted Spotify playlists. I work 60-70 hours per week to fund the making and marketing of my music, and it's a shame that I've wasted thousands of dollars here.Omari will claim that your music is expected to reach a certain threshold of plays as ""proof"" that their service is legitimate. However, based on my experiences with other playlist-pitching services, I can absolutely guarantee you that, if the playlists that my song was placed into were either organically grown and/or weren't bot-infested, I wouldn't have seen such a sudden drop-off in saves and a complete snapback in monthly listeners (back to exactly where I was before the promotion started) once the promotion ended. One thing I forgot to mention that put the nail in the coffin: I spotted 2 playlists that had most of their followers erased. More specifically, ""Hip Hop Music"" and ""Chill Music 2020."" Both playlists had just under 100K followers when my singles were first placed into both playlists during both promotional periods. Then, suddenly, both playlists only had around a few dozen followers. Spotify frequently wipes out playlists that are spotted to host a mass amount of fake followers. As of writing this, it looks like both playlists are back up to a little over 1,000 followers, so it looks like EDM Hits (who owns both playlists) are trying to slowly artificially pump their numbers back up. These are just 2 examples; who knows how many other playlists that my songs were placed into also had their follower-count wiped out because of artificial inflation.Also, although it wasn't necessarily a dealbreaker for me, some people might have a problem with their music being placed in playlists that don't match their genre or feeling of the song. The hip hop track that I had promoted with Omari is dark and gritty (both production and lyricism), so to have it placed in ""Chill Music 2020"" had me scratching my head.Source: Without disclosing too much of my personal life, I worked in marketing (more specifically, streaming marketing) at one of the major labels, so I know a thing-or-two about playlisting and how the numbers should look once a song is either removed from or shuffled around a network of (legitimate) playlists.-----Update: Refunds are not issued to customers. Omari gauges the success of campaigns solely based off of the quantity of (botted) streams. I was under the impression that Omari’s campaign would’ve generated organic playlist traffic - if I wanted botted playlist traffic, I would’ve used a different company for much cheaper.  For those who don’t know (I’ve seen many 5-star reviews come in with people not knowing what they’re talking about after purchasing Omari’s Spotify campaign), the only way to differentiate organic versus inorganic traffic for playlist placements is not by quantity of streams, but by the health of the song once the track is removed from the playlist (analyzed through Spotify’s backend metrics and manually tracking statistics pre-and-post placements). I’m extremely disappointed. Good luck to those who still choose to opt in.

He's also deleted my comments.  So, I will share them here.  Omari's tik tok advice demonstrates the complete ignorance about tik tok from a supposed music promotion expert, not only that, but it is the most ageist, stereotypical crap I have ever seen.  He really should do his research before pontificating such rubbish!   I also take issue with Omari talking about how to ""game"" the algorithm on tik tok.  Does he""game"" his customers?  What does he mean ""game""?  Isn't the music business about hard work and talent? Disappointed in this I have to say.

5fe22bfc755dc107e0cbcdab,4,One of the Only Legitimate Promotion Services Out Here,"At first, I was skeptical of Omari MC's services, only because there are so may fake playlist push companies out there that offer you x amount of plays for a specific fee, but in turn they just put your music on a playlist filled with bots. I can definitely say that this isn't the case with Omari. For starters, they actually take the time to listen to your music, and provide feedback. Fake Spotify Promo companies don't even bother to listen to your stuff, nor do they even place your music in playlists of a similar genre. Fake promo companies also tend to have playlists that are filled with terrible music, because they don't take the time to properly curate their playlists. Omari actually took the time to not only place my music on playlists that are of a similar genre(the music on said playlist was great as well), but he even placed me on playlists that were created by curators that live in my city, which shows that they value being calculated with their approach. The growth, in terms of streams, followers, and listeners can be kind of slow, which is actually a GOOD thing, because it reflects real human behavior, as opposed to botted playlists which give you 800 fake streams in one day. My only complaint is that their turn over rate can be kind of slow. I ordered the Bronze package, which I was told would be delivered in 1-4 business days, but it ended up taking two weeks.

Some 14 days after the campaign went live I am on 51 playlists, 40 or so of which I think are from the Omari promotion. The number of plays has been lower than I might have expected (around 1500 so far) but it continues to rise & my number of monthly listeners has risen from 52 to 760 at time of writing, not bad for an acoustic pop/folk song. If you think that paid promotion will pay for itself or make you rich - it probably won't.

5fc3dfe05e693f08f00e0b29,4,"Omari keeps its promises, gets results","I’m an Americana songwriter from Kansas City and have written songs on and off since 1970. I got more serious around 2010 (when I started performing) and then in March of 2020, when the pandemic struck and I was laid off. It was then that I began to understand what being serious about a craft really means, and how much work can go into refining the melody, lyrics, singing and overall presentation.I’ve released four studio CDs since 2015 and have enough songs recorded in pre-produced form to fill almost two more.What I didn’t have was a way to promote my music outside of Kansas City. I read a blogger’s review/ranking of 10 promotional companies and both Omari and another outfit seemed suited to having my songs added to playlists, promoted on You Tube and eventually pushed to alternative, college and public radio stations.Omari promptly responded to my first and subsequent emails. The other service responded, but not quite as quickly. I chose Omari because of its range of services, responsiveness and its prices. I felt it fit my needs.My first promotion was for three songs at the Bronze level. I staggered the releases three weeks apart with the thought that first exposure could build An audience through the third and beyond.The songs (all from my “Just Us Chickens” CD) attracted more than 2,000 listeners and are still being played. One of the songs, “Everything I Know (I Learned from Loneliness)” had 1,500 streams and is still on playlists.I followed those with a Christmas single (“In the Arms of a Song”) I thought would do well. It was streamed 650 times in just 4 days and was over 1,700 the last time I checked. It was even picked up by a playlist devoted to music for movies — a nice surprise — that’s played it 600+ times!In retrospect, I was trying to time the release to coincide with the Christmas season. The song might’ve done even better had I waited to release it two or three weeks before Christmas day, rather than Nov.15.Omari has done what it said it would do — released my music promptly and used its network of playlist operators to have it played. My only criticism (why my rating is four stars, not five) is that the majority of the playlists adding my songs seemed similar and generic. I listened to some other songs on the lists and thought my brand of music might’ve done better on lists  that placed more emphasis on lyrics and originality, and targeted a more music-savvy, sophisticated audience.But I’m pleased overall and am planning a new Omari promotion of several songs from “Pigeon Toad,” a CD with a Dec. 7 release date. I haven’t decided yet which programs I’ll buy, but I may release songs at different levels (Bronze, Gold etc.) and stagger them toward a finale of the strongest song.Longterm I don’t expect commercial success.

When I came across Omari,  I  ordered a  YouTube campaign for my afrobeat song and got hundreds of new subscribers, and the estimated views were reached. After the campaign,  the subscribers and the views remained and are still increasing till today. Omari would rather give thousands of streams or views that stick than millions of fake numbers that go away or even hurt an artist's career. I choose to WALK to my destination safely instead of to RUN and get stuck halfway.

They have always delivered on time for me. I do not plan on giving anyone else business with music promo.

The simple fact that he mentions he won’t accept every song unless he thinks it will do well is such an important and key aspect, and for me its kinda like he becomes a manager. As independent artists, we don’t have managers who tell us that some of our songs might not do well so when Omari and his team decide to accept or not accept a song, it’s like an honest opinion of your music, and I value that because it helps me become a better musician myself if he were to decide not to accept a song of mine. As of now I’ve done two purchases of 50k placements for Spotify and I have been pleased with the results and I will continue to use Omari MC’s service for being an honest and simple company.

Our artist makes Indie Pop/eclectic pop and electronic music and finding ways to increase organic exposure of her music is very important to us.  We want to increase the number of people who listen to, but are not interested in bot or fake plays. I have tried a number of different companies for help with a wide range of results.  I value a few things about Omari's services as compared to other companies.  The first is that they're for real.  They deliver authentic listeners on real playlists.  They don't provide plays, they provide access to listeners which is what you want if you believe in your music.The second thing I appreciate about Omari is their communication, openness, and willingness to solve problems.  When you write them an email a real human answers your message and they are there to help you figure out your issue.  The third thing that I value about Omari is their value.  They provide a real product for a good price.  They also provide lots of educational extras that I definitely suggest you take advantage of.  I learned how to make effective Facebook ads using the free course Omari included as a bonus with the promotion.For a new artist considering different companies, I'd say that Omari is a legit company which is the number 1 thing you want to know about a music promotion company, they are very easy to work with, and the price they charge for what they do is fair.

This will be useful information if I work with other PR companies as well.

Their playlists have either bots or no real listeners as the numbers are the same before promo. This is ridiculous and I warn everyone out there about them, this company is using your money to advertise on YouTube and Facebook, all you see on YouTube ads is Omari talking about not getting tricked into music marketing, when he’s tricking everyone into his business.

I always told myself when the time was right, I was going to use your services and the time was right. I honestly didn’t know if my song was going to get picked up because I know your policy on the music, but after I paid for the service, within 24-48 hours I received a email. In the email was a quick review of my song which they told me that the song sounded good and of quality. I was immediately excited. Even gave me a site to track my songs on playlist, which the site tracks the song a week or two faster than Spotify which was awesome. They did everything they were suppose to do, I was able to track what they told me they were going to do and that was awesome! Definitely going to use the services again and try other services that you have! I just want to say thank you for everything. I knew you were true to what you do from me following your pages and site and you showed it as well.

5f48e11a02e85708c8dabf1f,1,"Poor customer service, even worse business approach.","I purchased a $77 'organic' Spotify promotion for my track 'We Are Vicious'. I was told 4 - 7 working days, it was 13. Wouldn't be so bad if anyone at this 'company' actually responded to my emails. 2 days before it finally went 'live', I sent a 3rd chaser email, which someone responded saying it was live (it wasn't) and the link to the playlists were 'in this thread', they weren't. I actually received a link two days later, when it did actually go live.Finally I thought we were getting somewhere, then I looked at the playlists my track 'We Are Vicious' was added to... 'Happy Music 2020' (with picture of puppy), 'Good Vibes Only'... you get the idea. To repeat, my track is called 'We Are Vicious' and has nothing to do with being super happy or good vibes, it's about the struggles of the mind. Anyway, 77 dollars later and I have had under 400 streams from the '50k Playlists Placement'. Underwhelming is an understatement. Furious and entirely taken advantage of is a better way to put it.Here's a suggestion to Omari, how about you do the honourable thing and reject music that just isn't suitable for your promotion services? My track obviously didn't fit with your placements, so either you are greedy and just wanted my money, or you are delusional and thought that my track (which you had received the lyrics for) was suitable for Happy and Good Vibes playlists, which to anyone with a knowledge of music, it isn't.I should have just paid 77 people a dollar each to stream my track a few times and would've had a better return.Unless I somehow receive a full refund from Omari, I will ensure that all of my artist and musician friends will be aware of this shady business model and non existent customer service.Do not use Omari, you have been warned.",2020-08-28T10:48:58.000Z,"August 28, 2020",David John Brady,1,GB,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/5f48e11a02e85708c8dabf1f,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5f48de01f4f0f378e918f039

5f388e839cc22a0600cca968,4,One Month later - here's my results (UPDATE),"EDIT: I'm leaving the original post up, but I'm amending it.After my month-long campaign ended, I sent some screen shots showing that 1 of my 3 songs was never added to a playlist and had barely any plays. After a few back and forths, I was contacted by someone else within the company who apologized, explained that between COVID and some other issues, it looks like it very well may have fallen through some cracks.This person committed to fixing the problem, added all 3 songs to some playlists, and definitely showed an interest in the success of my songs. This was honestly the first time I felt like someone at their company really cared, and he went the extra mile to ensure I was treated with respect. It seems I might have just gotten a bad rep having a bad day and got off to a bad start together. In the 4 days since that happened, I've already garnered more plays for all 3 songs than I did in the first month. I've been impressed with their reaching out to try to fix what went wrong in our communication the first time. Amending my 2 stars to 4 stars; after this ""make up"" campaign is over, I will update.*****************************************************************My name is Jay Carlin, and I'm a songwriting and music creator who releases original music. Today is August 16. I gave Omari MC's service a month before reviewing, because I know these things take time. Here's my experience:I sent them three songs on July 16. I immediately got an email back that said ""Thanks for sending! The songs were well done overall. Good production, engineering, and delivery."", as well as a link to a PDF document explaining the music business. I later realized this wasn't really an evaluation of my music, but was just an auto-response, because it was in every email they sent me from that point forward. On July 20th, a few days after they said all was good, they emailed again stating they could not add one of the songs because it contained the word ""damn"". Which is fine, their decision, but I asked for either a refund or a replacement song. I sent multiple emails, and got no reply. Finally, I contacted them via Facebook. They apologized and said they were ""very backed up"" and would be emailing me about adding the 3rd song soon, despite me paying $17 extra to get service ""within one business day"", and this was almost 10 business days later at this point with no results. This is my main complaint: their customer support and communication was generally not good -- many days between responses, very terse responses, and a few emails didn't even get replies. The 3rd song was finally added, according to them, almost 2 weeks after my submission, and I only saw an increase in plays this week. The 3rd song still hasn't received the minimum 25 plays to be listed on Spotify's Artist app, so I have no idea if it's actually been added to any playlist, or what playlist it was added to. As for the results, I paid $77 per song plus a $17 ""within one business day"", for a total of $248. In 28 days, the first song received 408 plays, the second 279, and the third 51. The rest of the songs on my album had an average of about 50 plays in the same time frame, and I'm not sure how much traffic was from them or from traffic I was already generating, so I think it would be fair to deduct about 50 plays from those numbers, as I was hitting those kind of numbers prior to signing up for their service.Was their service worth 33 cents per play? I would say no. For you, it might be. I'd recommend if you want to try them, do a single song first, and don't pay extra for ""next business day"" service, because it was weeks before I had mine.",2020-08-30T01:51:13.000Z,"August 16, 2020",Jay Carlin,1,TH,https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/5f388e839cc22a0600cca968,https://www.trustpilot.com/users/5f388e7c653ade1dd56b7cbe

In the beginning also Understand I was a bit unknowledgeable of how their service works until I started to see results that showed me what was the purpose of ongoing promotion to build up a following. So people get to know who you are and what you’re about and what you are putting out to the world trying to find an honest promotion company that gives you legit outcome is hard I did my homework searching and finding companies that were showing honest feedback not only from them but customers. Like any promotions I noticed that you have to understand that Rome wasn’t built in a day it will take time and diligence and it also has to do with the work that you present to them you can’t expect them to work wonders with something that is mediocre. But if you give them something that is phenomenal and some thing that will make it even easier for them to do what they known for and do best than you will be in the ballpark. With them and you were score a homerun every time. So for anyone that is looking to use them for their promotions understand that it’s a partnership. Don’t expect things to just Blow up right away. For you with just one promotion that You purchase if you don’t have a huge following already where people will spread the word and let them know who you are it took time for me to get to where I am now. And believe me so it will be the same for you also. If you give them something that is fire in their eyes they will work to make it an inferno for you but before that happens it Hass to be fire not just a little spark.

Previously I had tried using Fiverr which is full of scammers who use bots and blow up your numbers but do not create any real engagement, then I used PlaylistPush who do a genuine job but are overpriced for their dubious results and have a lot of playlisters who are doing it for the money. In stark contrast to these previous efforts, I found Omari to be more savvy in his research, generating higher spins and deeper fan engagement. Their response rate is good and they always address my questions and explain themselves fully. He also sends you free online courses and advice on how to position yourself for maximum traction.

This is one of the companies that claims working only with an organic audience.... but one of the very very few that keeps its promises and is actually doing it ! In my opinion, paying for bots and fake streams is totally nonsense and won't get new fans...if you want to take another road, certainly longer but more rewarding in the end, Omari is a partner of choice, with competitive prices given the results you will get.

I chose the 50K package and actually got on playlists totaling 120K, whether by accident or not. In the end I got about 2000 streams to kick start the song, which I thought was great. Omari was also kind enough to give me valuable feedback on my track, which was insightful and useful.  Best thing though was the way the extra streams made the band feel more validated. We’ve been busy writing more music as a result. To be honest, it took me a while to take the plunge and buy the first package from Omari but I’m so glad I did. I’m sure you will be too. I think the bad reviews below come from people who really don't understand their own role in the process of becoming a working musician.

5e8e82ee086b64095432f27f,1,Extremely low audience retention (2% at 2 minutes via ad vs 30% organic),"Don't waste money on a service that is not going to help you build a legitimate fanbase. The YouTube ads are ineffective at finding you people who are going to be interested in your content, they just do discovery ads so that it counts all the views from people who will not actually watch your video. At 2 minutes into the video my retention rate from the ad was a dismal 2%, bringing my overall retention way down from about 30% from the organic views. I emailed Omari's team halfway through the ad asking if they could change the age targeting because its audience was out of my demographic. The audience was 87% ages 25-65+ and my target demographic is 13-25. I did not recieve a reply. I called after a few days of terrible audience retention and asked for the ad to be pulled so it wouldn't bring my stats down further. Omari gave me a BS response about how it's because it's not an in play ad and the view counts are counting all views whereas in play counts only if they get to 30 seconds at least, and that at 2 minutes an in play ad would have 6% retention. Ok well still way more than 2% retention on my discovery ad. Its not because it's a bad video either. A preview of the vid is getting me about 50c a follower on instagram in expensive areas primarily california. So the age targeting and most likely the rest of the targeting is just nothing close to the ""highly targeted YouTube ads to have maximum engagement because we have thousands of dollars of experience"" that was advertised to me. These people don't know your fanbase better than you do and at any rate you are not going to benefit from enhanced targeting from these ads vs running them yourself or finding an ads manager that will listen to your input and feedback. Omari's company will disregard your feedback, I brought up the age issue twice and zero response. Super unprofessional of them and a waste of money. They also would not elaborate on how my ad was being presented because I still have no idea. Glad I ran this as a test ad because I was considering buying much bigger packages if the service worked.
