Its easy to get up close to the stage and there is a bag check option at the bar. You can typically buy tickets in advance or at the door, at least, I had those options. The sound as good but the lighting is pretty dark, even for a club. I would recommend bringing ear plugs, especially if youre up close. There are mens and womens bathrooms but theyre not clearly labeled to the right of the stage. Theres a picture of a little girl on the ladies door, which has 2 stalls and 1 sink. The bathroom was small but clean. Parking in the area is a bit of an issue, so Id recommend arriving early and parking on the street. Just pay really close attention to street signs and parking restrictions because some areas require permits so be prepared. I usually like parking in pay lots because of safety but the neighborhood seemed ok. It is in San Francisco, so if you dont like parking on hills (which I dont), just try to be there early to look for your ideal parking.

The Lillingtons were in town and I did not want to miss out on this! Doors at 8:30, show at 9. I arrived at 9:10 and the place was already packed. Friendly staff checking IDs and tickets. I did not order food or beverage while there, but saw others enjoying spirits and eats. It gets pretty warm inside, but theres a back patio you can escape to. Clean, stocked restroom. Attended another (sold out) show on 2/17/18, my car was broken into. While they do post notices on their door and windows stating to leave nothing in your vehicle, my car and several others were hit sometime between 9pm -1 am. This venue does not allow in and out privileges for patrons.  With that being said, perhaps they will consider posting security OUTSIDE the venue to deter things like this from happening.  People will be less excited about coming to a venue when their vehicle is likely to get vandalized or worse.  Luckily, there was nothing in my car to steal, however the damage they did to the vehicle itself is costly. If you have a hatchback, I recommend removing your rear deck lid so thieves can see you have nothing back there.

Was there to check out a band, Sick of Sarah, who were performing for the night. A small and cosy venue space ideal for smaller bands. The bar only accepts cash, likewise cash payment for the entry fee if any. They do have an ATM just next to the entrance if you didnt carry cash. Though the place appear kind of old and rundown, the sound system was good. The bar carries the typical alcoholic drink and a limited list of beers. Drinks are cheap, beers were at $6/bottle. Tried to request for Mojito but they do not have any mint. So ended up with two Strongbow cider which worked out well too. Two girls next to us ask for their special shots listed on the wall, the bartender whispered to them that he got no clue what it was. Thought it was pretty hilarious, apparently he was just stepping in before the real bartender comes in. The streets were pretty dark by the time we got there, it appears to be located in the midst of an industrial area. Ideal for a music venue so there wouldnt have much sound/music limit restrictions.
