Bottom of the Hill,"Nov 29, 2023","very cute vibes, very bad venue! We showed up at to a concert at 8 (the time stated on the ticket), and went inside, only to learn that the performers wouldn t go on until at-least 10 (and that the openers wouldnt preform till at least 9?). Since we were not told this and we now had 2 hours to burn, we tried to leave and were told that of we did, we could not come back in. Since we didnt want to wait 2 hours in a hot cramped space (with no seats), we left and lost the money we paid for tickets. Very unhappy with the way the venue handled this whole situation, and how the venue communicates policies about their concerts. Would definitely not come again :("

Bottom of the Hill,"May 29, 2023","One of the best venues I have EVER been to! I passed out before the show (just dehydrated, I m fine) and the staff was super caring and attentive. They gave me water, juice, and let me sit by the bar to watch the beginning of the show while I recovered, which I really appreciated. The venue is beautiful, with someone new and interesting to see everywhere you look and I loved the wall of past bands that played. We even got our vinyls signed by the Symposium! Thank you so, so much to Bottom of the Hill for helping me and giving my friends and I such incredible memories!"

Enjoy from a wide variety of touring and local artists and admire the old calendars on the wall wondering which weeks you would have liked to have been there (or maybe were there) in the 90s and early 2000s. Good food if you need a bite during a show too, not always the easiest to come by!"

Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2023","Bottom of the Hill is a great venue for punk shows (and other live music Im sure, but the interior definitely appeals to the 80s/90s punk fan). The main area is open and can accommodate a small circle pit, and the sound system is good. I dig the framed concert posters that fill the walls of the back room; it gives you something to look at when lounging at one of the few tables. Theres also a  back patio that has some benches & chairs for fresh air/smoke breaks (kinda counterintuitive, I know). I should also note that theres plenty of free parking on the street, and the neighborhood is pretty clean; Ive never seen any dirts roaming around, but it is San Francisco,  sooooo... Ive only gone to punk shows at Bottom of the Hill, thus tickets have been relatively cheap ($20-$25, including the ~$5 fees), so no complaints there. I cant remember how much drinks cost or how good they were---which likely means they werent ridiculously over-priced and got the job done---but I typically drink gin & tonics, and you cant really go wrong with those."

The shape and sound of the room is great for those mid-size touring acts, but every time I have been, the place was packed, which always feels good to see the strong support for those lesser well known acts. Gotta give it up for this venue for giving those great bands a solid platform. Tickets are usually very reasonably priced. If anything, they seem unrealistic for San Francisco, but thats why I love this place. Holding it down, and maintaining an enclave for the arts and expression to thrive in the heart of a city sterilized by cost of living."

But if youre paying attention to a poster while someone is playing, #best be the #opener! ) and are #gorgeous In one word: #balls In two words: #bigballs In three words!: #bigbouncyballs In six words!?!: #bigbouncyballsoffthewalls I mean it! No lie... Watching @kflay for the 4th time (2nd time here! First time was a little over 5 years ago on my 5th year anniversary being married to the #absolute #love of my #life! #Ruby (Not her actual name, but thats a whole nother story all together! - for another time  ) yesterday on #taxday and I would say @kflay killed the show... But that would be a #lie! @kflay WAS THE #SHOW and oh boy could I tell you about it!! But there just isnt enough time, because this is all about @ thebottomofthehill While @kflay (whom btw I just #HAVE to mention, just to give you a taste of how bad I stink!   I literally brought my #bassguitar for @kflay to sign.  Why does that stink? #GOODQUESTION! The answer: I only told her #literally #hours before the show and I #actually thought I would have my #cookies because I prefer over cake - You are what you eat! and eat it too. Was soo heavy, and some might say for nothing! I say Only a small part to yet another #unbelievable story I have to tell!) did not sign my bass, I #did lock eyes with her as she exited the stage, but instead of what happened right when I got there! (which after years of experience in going the distance for a show, leaving #fashionably #late not only #avoids #traffic, but if timed properly... You make it right for the headliner! #fortherecord - I have showed up soo late to catch only #three songs, but I won the tickets soo... ) I went straight to the back to check out whatever inventory was left, and as I turned around to find my #muchbetterhalf @rubyubie she was no where to be found because from the #patio area #coincidentally located in the back, walks into the room non other than @kflay herself! And I was taken back... #Frozen like a #skunk in the headlights as she took less than ten steps #probably and #tookthestage Reminded me of the time one of my most #influential #idols came walking down the stairs right in front of my face! #Who? Im so glad you asked! #BlakeSchwartzenbach (Not his actual name... If you have #noclue who he is, I could probably say the same about me! Unlike me though, he is SO SMART! His first band I fell in love with is called @Jawbreaker and straight from the horses mouth - #24HourRevengeTherapy is #thealbum that was Their first complete story.  SO! A little more about Jawbreaker... They started out 100% punk, and wouldnt you know, back when they first blossomed, they would play #here! See how it all comes togerther? #butwaittheresmore! Soo.. #24 was their #breakthrough album where pretty much one line from one of their #famous songs you probably know, but you dont know you know, but you should know! (hehehe heads up! Hes so smart!!! You have to decifer what hes really saying in #alot of the lyrics ex. I blew twelve kisses and kissed your thirteenth finger. #thinkaboutit #Itjustmakessensewhenyoudontthinktoohard ) called #boxcar suming up what they #wanted to say!  First line Youre not #punk, and Im telling everyone! Save your breath!  I never was one... You dont know what Im all about. Like killing cops and reading #keroac  This was the #first #notable #breakthrough #album for me that is so #personal I am pretty much explained through #every #song The other album half, in the exact same #wantingtoshowwhattheyweremadeof @TheOffspring s #IxnayontheHombre (Which I literally bought the vinyl just a day before the show!

Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2019",The place is pretty great. It is cash only but they have an ATM if needed. Street parking was good and I went on a Saturday night. They have a full bar & kitchen. They also have a back patio where you can hang and smoking is allowed there. Seating is somewhat limited as its a live-music venue. Great experience.

The best seat in the house was on the front sidewalk. I have no idea why the volume is so loud. It doesnt sound good, it just sounds loud!"

Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2019","Awesome little venue that seems to be setup for smaller artists, but has a great vibe. The place is mostly a dive bar, with little tables / seats and a stage, from what I know, since they mostly focus on shows. the acoustics are alright, definitely fine for seeing someone you enjoy. I read previous reviews stating parking may result in break-ins, but parking about a block away had no issue, it didnt even feel sketchy, though I would still hide or take valuables. It mostly is an industrial from what I can tell (live in the East bay), with little people roaming around at night outside of people in the neighborhood or people working."

Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2019","I like the venue for seeing my favorite bands when they come to town, and for watching my  local and touring friends bands open the shows.but, the band lineups are 75% not my choice for music...and then the other 25% of the time I  really am glad there is a place this size to see...aomeone like The Zeros or The  Lillingtons...in SF.. ..fun outside garden/lounge area...good for socializing. Cool area in the back of the club for bands to set up merch tables to sell records and tshirts...etc.... Cover charge is decent for a medium capacity venue. Bartenders are usually prompt...I feel the prices for drinks are on the higher side. The vibe can be a little cold as far as friendliness is concerned. All staff seem a bit standoffish, but it is not a big concern to me in the grand scheme of things,as no one is militant or helecoptering over me. I can relax here and it feels adaquately spacious inside and out. Parking is okay...I usually find a space. The location is good, not too far from the Bay bridge."

Staff were courteous and professional and make no bones that you have to watch your stuff in this neighborhood... Cars broken into etc.  Theres a big sign on their window and the manager keeps a boot on the wheel of her car.
Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2019","Flew in from Houston to see some friends and catch a concert here--this is now one of my favorite venues! A great bar staff with fair prices, and plenty of space throughout to kick back and enjoy whoever is on stage. Will definitely be coming back!"
Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2019","Great music, small venue but good acoustics. And a back area to go to sit and talk away from the crowd and music"
Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2019","This was a nice, small intimate venue. Its easy to get up close to the stage and there is a bag check option at the bar. You can typically buy tickets in advance or at the door, at least, I had those options. The sound as good but the lighting is pretty dark, even for a club. I would recommend bringing ear plugs, especially if youre up close. There are mens and womens bathrooms but theyre not clearly labeled to the right of the stage. Theres a picture of a little girl on the ladies door, which has 2 stalls and 1 sink. The bathroom was small but clean. Parking in the area is a bit of an issue, so Id recommend arriving early and parking on the street. Just pay really close attention to street signs and parking restrictions because some areas require permits so be prepared. I usually like parking in pay lots because of safety but the neighborhood seemed ok. It is in San Francisco, so if you dont like parking on hills (which I dont), just try to be there early to look for your ideal parking. Enjoy your shows!"

Not really my scene, but its got plenty of good qualities. The patio/smoking area is pretty nice and has an entire wall of plants abd succulents."

Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2018","I had not been to Bottom of the Hill in years until last night 2/1/18. The Lillingtons were in town and I did not want to miss out on this! Doors at 8:30, show at 9. I arrived at 9:10 and the place was already packed. Friendly staff checking IDs and tickets. I did not order food or beverage while there, but saw others enjoying spirits and eats. It gets pretty warm inside, but theres a back patio you can escape to. Clean, stocked restroom. Attended another (sold out) show on 2/17/18, my car was broken into. While they do post notices on their door and windows stating to leave nothing in your vehicle, my car and several others were hit sometime between 9pm -1 am. This venue does not allow in and out privileges for patrons.  With that being said, perhaps they will consider posting security OUTSIDE the venue to deter things like this from happening.  People will be less excited about coming to a venue when their vehicle is likely to get vandalized or worse.  Luckily, there was nothing in my car to steal, however the damage they did to the vehicle itself is costly. If you have a hatchback, I recommend removing your rear deck lid so thieves can see you have nothing back there.  Hopefully it saves you a broken window, or worse."

You can rent the space out on nights they arent booked for a show for much less than you would pay if you were, say, trying to buy the place out in lieu of a concert. You just have to wait for the next months calendar to come out and then pick a date they would normally be closed. This calls for super fast party planning, but its worth it."
Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2017","Its a minus star because its far from the city center, but the building has a nice San Francisco-style exterior. The interior is also beautiful I thought it was a venue where the stage was raised and narrow, and the distance between the audience and the artists was close, allowing for a comfortable performance. The bar also had a variety of local beers, so its a live house recommended for beer lovers."

Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2017",I like some of the local music but some is a bit wierd.
Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2017",I really enjoy this venue. It has some really kitchy decorations. I described it as the opening to saved by the bell. It has a smallish stage downstairs and the sound guy was really good the night I went. Drink prices are about average and it seemed to attract a solid young crowd.
Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2017","This is a great, dive bar that only takes cash and often times features live local bands. Bars like this are slowly going away, so enjoy it while you can."
Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2017",Great place to see music.
Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2017","Excellent venue, great drinks and staff was prompt and friendly. One of the better music venues Ive been too."
Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2017",Cozy atmosphere. The music is too loud though!
Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2017","I visited this venue to see one of my favorite musicians. I was hesitant at first due to the quality of the website, but when I arrived I found it well-suited to the events. The bar is cash-only, but the staff didnt mind breaking a $100 bill I got from one of my friends visiting the area on vacation on a $6 beer. The sound quality is pretty good, the space is kind of an odd shape, but it it works."
Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2016","Went there for the first time to see Pity Sex, Eskimueaux, and Colleen Green. The atmosphere was great. The place seems pretty chill and I got real close to the stage. The music was awesome, then a moshpit started in the last set, thank got I was able to stay in the front. The people at the door seemed cool. Totally would come back for another show."

Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2016","Im sure your mileage will vary.   The night we were there,  the first band was decent,  the second caused us to  order an Uber.    The Point Park Draft was pretty good.   CASH ONLY here.    Reasonable ATM fee."

Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2016",awsome!!! great show of palma violets.... nice surprise. Small but incredible atmosphere. For the ones looking to live real san francisco.
Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2016","First time visiting bottom at the hill. Was there to check out a band, Sick of Sarah, who were performing for the night. A small and cosy venue space ideal for smaller bands. The bar only accepts cash, likewise cash payment for the entry fee if any. They do have an ATM just next to the entrance if you didnt carry cash. Though the place appear kind of old and rundown, the sound system was good. The bar carries the typical alcoholic drink and a limited list of beers. Drinks are cheap, beers were at $6/bottle. Tried to request for Mojito but they do not have any mint. So ended up with two Strongbow cider which worked out well too. Two girls next to us ask for their special shots listed on the wall, the bartender whispered to them that he got no clue what it was. Thought it was pretty hilarious, apparently he was just stepping in before the real bartender comes in. The streets were pretty dark by the time we got there, it appears to be located in the midst of an industrial area. Ideal for a music venue so there wouldnt have much sound/music limit restrictions. There are plenty of parking along the streets so thats great for those who drive. Its also a short distant from the 22nd Caltrain."
Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2016",
Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2016","I like this venue, though its a bit out there and hard to get to.  Intimate small divey space, but if you get lucky you can catch some good acts that pass through here.  Theres even food available for order.  Beer prices are a standard fair for venues, with a $1 premium over what youd expect at a dive ($4 PBR)."
Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2015","I love San Francisco because of places like Bottom of the Hill, Slims...  Theres something fantastic about live music in a small venue.  If you get there too late and you end up in the back and youre short like me, you cant see much.  We were lucky to be about 6 deep from the stage.  Also this venue brings something out in the artist where theyre wanting to be part of the audience and theyre more than willing to come down and sing on the floor. The used the back room to sell merchandise the night we were here.  The wait is long since we had to make a line against the wall and wait for the meet and greet and then by merch all in the small back room.  But it was cool because everyone hung out and chatted with fans.  The guy that worked there was very good about keeping things organized, keeping people from cutting the line and really just a cool dude. The down side of this venue, waiting outside can get cold, the area is really dirty with trash and the risk of having your car broken into."

Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2015","Great place to just hang out. Not too crowded so the performance is always personal. Remember,bar runs on cash only."
Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2014",About the only downside is how out of the way it is from everything. And thats probably why its still one of the best places to see a local band in the city. May it live.
Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2014","One of the best concert venues in San Francisco.  Given its small size, its not tough to get a prime spot at the front of the stage.  This is a great place to see bands early before they get huge."

Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2013","Dare I call this place The Pride of San Francisco? I might. Listen, any venue where your bouncers and bar backers arent total jerks gets an A+ in my book. Add to the fact that that atmosphere at Bottom of the Hill is utter perfection, their food is kind awesome, parking is not a problem, and theyve been known to release a handful of tickets on the night of a sold out show (shhhh!), and well, need we say more? This is hands down my favorite venue not just in San Francisco, but ever."

Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2013","Such an intimate venue! If youre lucky enough to have one of your favorite bands playing here, dont miss it. The first time I went was to see fun. and I was shocked to find out the venue only held ~100 people - fun. had just played a huge show the night before.  Obviously a smaller place, but whoever was running it did a good job of not overcrowding it.  Easy to get drinks at and some outdoor space as well...agree with some other reviews that it is a little harder to get there due to location."
Bottom of the Hill,"Mar 29, 2013","Saw Saves The Day and Further Seems Forever here. Its a relatively small venue, but it makes the show more intimate. Drinks were pretty reasonable but they are of course, cash only."
