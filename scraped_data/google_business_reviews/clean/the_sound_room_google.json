There is a welcoming and comfortable vibe.  It starts with the clubs welcoming and fun owners and staff.  The audience is usually packed with amazing Jazz lovers who are friendly, engaged and interesting."

Its an intimate setting with its 15 or so small tables and maybe 20 stools along the walls occupied by a crowd that appreciates top quality music. These musicians may not be household names, folks, but you wont find better jazz or blues this side of New Orleans."
