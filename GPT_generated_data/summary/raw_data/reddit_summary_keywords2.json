        "summary": "Broadjam is a mixed bag for its users, who express varied experiences and opinions. Some users find it to be a useful platform for submitting music to sync license opportunities and have achieved successful placements. There are mentions of utilizing Broadjam to connect with libraries, industry professionals, and even securing deals with TV shows like CSI. However, skepticism about the site's legitimacy is evident, with users referring to it as 'broadscam' and criticizing it for high submission costs without guaranteed follow-ups or placements. The interface is described as dated, and while it offers free song postings, the strategies for exposure are perceived as lackluster compared to other services. Overall, the sentiment leans towards a cautious approach when utilizing Broadjam, with a recommendation to explore more reputable publishers or directly approach music supervisors for better chances of success.",
