# GPT generated data

## General info:
- This folder contains all of the GPT-generated content (summaries, keywords, etc.) for music services. The most recently added music services have not been added to the folder yet as there have been a couple of issues with the data (namely insufficient data).
- To see how all this data was generated, go to the ```Python notebooks``` folder to view the code. 
- Currently working on rewriting the code to use Azure OpenAI API instead of the regular OpenAI API

## Folder contents:
- The ```final_output``` folder contains the content formatted in a readable format (markdown and HTML files). The text is easier to read if you view the HTML file (download the file and open it in your browser).
- The ```raw_data``` folder contains the both the summaries and additional metadata formatted as ```.json``` files.
