1. steve ballmer was an idiot who instead of growing the Microsoft product line looked to make profits by lowering costs and taking market share in red ocean markets (markets with heavy competition, ""blood in the water"") like the game consoles and buying out other companies with innovative products (like Skype). no innovation, no vision, just a suit collecting a pay check on the backs of others. no, literally, Microsoft outlined all of apples innovations in the 90s, and when ballmer took over, he slashed r/d into them saying the tech wasn't there and it was a waste of money.

2.  smart watches aren't anything new, they have been around for a couple years now and been getting better. The Ipad, the Ipod, iphone, etc were either new Innovations at the time, or the first iteration of a product type that made a product line viable.

3. while part of what made apple successful was its innovation, what sustained it was steve jobs' charisma. the guy seriously new how to sell a product, not just that, but he knew to how to convince a community of apple consumers to feel special that they were trend setters, appealing beyond just graphic designers to other young people. apple wasn't the standard, which is nothing new, they were the underdog to microsoft, they were something different, something special, and they had been trying to pull this line [since the 80s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zfqw8nhUwA), but when they broke into blue ocean markets (untapped areas with little to no competition), it finally worked. prior to the ipod, Apple was struggling to make a profit, even today, without the iphone and ipad, Apple wouldn't really be making money as that accounts for 70 percent of their profits and is what boosted their hardware sales. I really dont get that charisma from the new ceo, and in many ways of how he presents himself, it looks like hes trying to emulate Jobs' fervor and style.

4. the apple brand survives off repeat buyers. for the last few years, android, and particularly samsung have been chipping away at the iphone's less diehard buyers. on top of this, the tablet market has grown much larger than the ipad (which mind you, is still the standard) with a number of competitive budget alternatives, as well as not so budget alternatives like the new surface pro (which has finally improved to the point of being on par with the ipad, first gen was garbage), nexus, galaxy tab, etc.

there's more, but those are the main bits. dont get me wrong, Apple is still going to be a major player for a good long while, but if they dont continue to innovate like they did under jobs, they are just going to be a whale swimming around in competitive markets where they once dominated but are now just a big player.

So step 1 like above, I unlock alchemy to level 3 or 4, I rush the jobs with AD. I pre-purchase all of the potions I'm going to need per each rank from the auction house, I also usually buy the aqua vitae (~500?) and around 10-15 of each potion is enough to 'level'

I get the 100% speed boost, and the grade 3 result with alchemy at this point.

I then do 1 slot alchemy/rest leadership. Leadership is usually around level 10 by the time alchemy hits 20 at this point.

I continue 100% leadership till it is around 17, then I do armor of class choice. So Rogue? Leatherworking. GWF? Mailsmithing. At this point I usually have 7 job slots. I dedicate 3 to armorcraft, and 4 to leadership.

The reason for this is it's faster then weapon/artificing.

Here's a basic synopsis of my leadership breakdown as I level up. You'll notice I select experience gain over leadership gain, this makes it so the time I hit around 57-58 my leadership is 20. (This also includes doing the 12 quests in Neverdeath graveyard for the 3rd bag)

Also my level 20 isn't necessarily recommended for a beginner, I have 1 hero, and 17 man-at-arms in order to get the guaranteed 24,000 a day automatically without doing anything besides praying 3 times.

* The entire Shinobi Alliance and the nine bijuu got their asses handed to them on a silver platter by a blind man
* A white Zetsu retrieved the other Rinnegan and gave it to Madara
* Madara ripped the Gedo Mazo out of Obito and used it to absorb the bijuu again, including Bee's and Naruto's - Bee survived by hiding in the Hachibi's severed tentacle again
* Madara got surprise attacked by Sasuke and then stabbed him with his own sword
* Madara became the Juubi jinchuuriki
* Sakura gets her most badass moment in the entire manga and *manually pumps Naruto's failing heart for him, with her hand inside his ribcage* while she and Gaara take him to get the other half of Kurama from Minato
* Black Zetsu interrupts the Kurama transfer and steals him
* Obito shanks Madara with his own hand, steals a chunk of Shukaku and Gyuki, and warps himself, Naruto and Sakura to the Kamui dimension
* Gai buys time by going Eighth Gate and using Evening Elephant, while Kakashi and Minato provide support via Kamui and Hiraishin
* Naruto and Sasuke talk to Ninja God, while in the land of the living Kabuto is fixing up Sasuke
* Gai almost kills the most powerful man on the planet by launching a flying kick at relativistic speeds
* Ninja Jesus and Ninja Judas, i.e. Naruto and Sasuke, arrive and fight the fucker, ending with Naruto *cutting the Shinju in half* and Madara reabsorbing it
* Madara ganks Kakashi's Sharingan, gloats Obito to death and takes back his Rinnegan
* Madara turns pretty much all of Frost Country into meteors, and while Naruto and Sasuke are distracted destroying those, activates the Infinite Tsukuyomi

This is likely the part where you've gotten confused - during the activation of the IT, the moon shone so bright it seemed like daytime. This light appeared to be capable of penetrating walls and eyelids, and in fact most likely everything except Sasuke's new Rinnegan-boosted Susanoo. The Shinju mummified everyone to begin turning them into Zetsus, Yamato got his first and only panel in the last two or three years, and pretty much as soon as Madara landed he got stabbed and Kaguya'd.

0,,t1_ckf44d1,1,1410413678,,t1_ckf0gfe,False,Psychic,False,,t5_2qmhd,"ToasterBub, You are an intelligent witty individual who came into this life with an approach that is heavily dependent on logic and analysis. You are called to cultivate the feeling and intuitive side of your personality and, in so doing, to become more heart-centred. Innovative and questioning, you are blessed with many aptitudes. Highly dependable and responsible, you are not a traditionalist but your objectivity may appear to others to be cold and some of your decisions heartless. You have all the intuition and feelings of anyone else - you just need to put them to better use. As you do so, you will round out and balance your personality. Eventually, having refined all your strengths, you will be able to switch back and forth between intuition and logic so smoothly and rapidly that you will always seem to know the right thing to do or say. Maximising your talents in this fashion ensures that you are not only agile but versatile. Though this life path promises considerable worldly success, the price for it is some hard work in the areas of relationship and feeling. Your core lesson is to lose your need to be detached and to develop your intuitive side. Your goal is to become heart-centred, combining both logic and intuition, and using your gifts of inventiveness, intuition, brilliance, and fearlessness to achieve success and happiness.

Your challenge in life is coping with the needs of others. You must understand that some people need more help than others to stand on their own two feet. Empathy can help improve all your relationships.

ToasterBub, you are an innovative explorer who is always willing to take risks and venture boldly into the unknown or to experiment with new ideas and concepts. Your courageous style will often be admired by others and, because you are so independent, your life is sure to be packed with excitement and suspense. Despite your colourful and independent approach to life, however, you can be over-sensitive to the opinions of others, easily getting hurt when criticized. With a tendency to take things personally, it is important for you to learn to calm down between the ages of fourteen and forty-one, a period when your life can be full of aggression, assertiveness, and new ventures. After the age of forty-two, you will have a need for even greater calm and emotional steadiness.

You can be be full of energy and enthusiasm, moving so fast it can wear yourself and others out. You may flit from one job, project, or relationship to another, as you love variety and challenge. Although others may regard you as reckless, you are in fact far less impulsive than you appear. From an early age, you may have learned to trust in yourself because your intuition frequently leads you in the right direction. You have an ability to see the world from an unusual viewpoint and, for this reason, you make a great advisor and friend upon whom people can become dependent. The dependency of others, however, can cause you feelings of frustration when others can’t or won’t stand on their own two feet.

A part of you will always long to fly away but, once you have found a way to balance your need for responsibility with your need to rush headlong into uncharted lands, you have the perception, charisma and enthusiasm to push forward social reforms. Although capable of great commitment once you have found a cause you believe in, you should make sure that you never lose touch of the key to your personality and success - your adventurous and curious spirit.

Love: you have a passion for romance and excitement. Your dynamic drive and energy should gain you plenty of admirers and you tend to fall in love quickly. Although you are capable of great commitment in a relationship, there will always be a part of you that wants to spread its wings. For this reason, any partner you are involved with needs to learn to avoid routine and adapt to your need for excitement, romance and adventure in a relationship.

Health: you can push yourself hard and, as a result, can place yourself under incredible and unnecessary pressure. Learning to recognize the signs of stress before you slip into depression is crucial. As far as diet is concerned, plenty of variety is important as you will suffer if you are forced to stick to a regimented dietary regime. Regular moderate to vigorous exercise is recommended to help you release pent-up stress and tension, and also to keep your weight under control. Foot massages before you go to bed will help calm you down, and putting a few drops of clary sage essential oil on a handkerchief to smell will be helpful when you feel low or in need of a confidence boost.

Career: you are a born social campaigner. You have a profound sense of justice and empathy for the underdog and this makes you a natural social reformer or campaigner. Indeed, whatever career you enter into - be it sport, art or politics - you will always show a marked interest in humanitarian concerns. Your ability to advise and influence others may also draw you to counseling, psychology, teaching, writing, and management and, because you have great intuitive powers, the world of psychic development may appeal.

Your mission is to learn responsibility and commitment toward others. Once you have been able to do that without losing your sense of adventure, your destiny is to commit yourself to humanitarian concerns and, by so doing, make the world a better and a fairer place.

2014 for you is about a new start, a new chapter in your life. It holds the promise of being an exciting adventure, with life taking on new challenges that pave the way for the next cycle in your life. This is a time to clarify your goals and it is a time to act on them. Hard work may be necessary to get a new venture or idea moving. Your physical strength will be up during the year, perhaps higher than it has been for some time, as you may have some special needs for this extra energy. You are learning to initiate what really motivates you. It is not a time to wait around, since you could miss out on what this year has to offer. It is OK to be a little selfish in 2014. Take time for introspection, as it will add to clarity and a sense of direction. You may at times feel called to stand on your own this year, and your creativity and inventiveness will be at their peak. This is definitely a time to have courage, make plans, and avoid indecision. It is a time of work, as you are laying new foundations, and opening up to new opportunities. Avoid being impulsive or headstrong, yet be willing to change for the sake of your own personal progress and happiness. This is an auspicious time to begin new relationships and make new connections for personal or business reasons. 

2015 will be quieter and will focus mainly on relationships. It will be a 'wait and see' time; a year when you will find yourself in the background and very much in a stage of development. This is not a time to force the issue and try to move forward. It is a time for building relationships that will benefit you in the future; a year for accumulating and collecting. Aggressiveness will cause problems now. You must be prepared for delays, detours, stoppages and you must be patient. This is a time of small contributions, of helping, and details must be taken care of when they come up. You may give time and effort to further another's work. This year may be a test to your self-control and emotional sensitivities. This is a time to improve your abilities to work with others in a productive way and this can be difficult for you if you have chiefly worked alone in the past. Keep calm, cool, and pleasant. You may experience a degree of nervous tension during this period; there may be a tendency to emotional extremes including depression. Very deep relationships with another person will be more apt to occur during 2015. Or if you have a partner, there is apt to be a deepening of feeling in the relationship. 2015 will require much cooperation from you. You are asked to continue with the development of what you began in 2014. Balance is a key factor as you will utilize time as a tool to help you further advance your goals and aspirations.

Good luck to you!

We normally play it with 3 or 4 players, and when other players see they have no chance of scoring the most and coming first then they might try to throw the game so that no-one wins. Thematically I guess that doesn't make too much sense but sometimes you just got to win :P

Also just with choosing what card types/colours you are going to collect, and which heroes, so that you can combo chain your cards together effectively. Also with cards that help/hurt other players you have to decide when is best to hurt them and when you have no choice but to help them or risk losing the game. And also when to let other players get a hero card they need to help them help the team stay alive and when to K.O. a hero card they are after just so they can not have it.

I just find Dominion is basically build up good economy/gold then in last couple turns just go for VP. Yes when you do that is up to you, but its what you are going to do, every game.

Legendary you can build for early damage, so you get early kills and get the bonuses off fallen bad guys to boost you. 
You can build for a good economy so that you stand a better chance of picking up the more powerful cards first. 
You can build a balance of both.
You can build so you have a better chance of not being affected by enemy cards.
You can focus on building 2 colours to easily combo or multiple colours to have variety and combo with other heroes.

I find the strategy varies with whatever heroes are available in the deck, at that exact moment, what villains are in the villain deck and who the mastermind is, and what their scheme is. There are a lot more variables in play within each game, and there are multiple ways to get around them but you need to be besting the game and the other players.

Obviously this is dependant on the way you play, some people like to play purely co-operative. We don't. I feel dominion is a lot more limited in option, yes all the options are available at the get-go where in legendary you only have 5 cards available at any given time. But it doesn't mean it has less strategy just because there are 5 cards out.

And just from what you had said about you decide your strategy at the beginning of the game then go for it, I think with legendary you can't do that. The game shifts when schemes come up, or when other players go for your cards, or discard them just because you need them. It changes as you play and you have to adapt.

Yes there may be more strategy in dominion when you add the expansions, I have not played the expansions, of either dominion or legendary, so that is what I am basing my opinion on. I also am staying with only using base games because I doubt OP will drop to get a lot of expansions with first purchase.",2,Zsaber,True,t3_2fyoi1,0,ckf3v1k,0,1427077346,

Here's an incredibly lengthy write-up I did a long while ago saying why this is my favorite game of all time:

EDIT: There are SPOILERS in this write-up. 

Oh. My. God. This game is absolutely incredible. From the beginning, all the way until the end there were so many parts that I just absolutely loved about this game. Instead of just listing the pros and cons, I'm going to go through in order what I like and what I didn't like about this game.
To start off, the title screen for this game was really fun to look at. The slow camera moving through Clock Town while also seeing Link casually sitting among places. Then at the end it shows the Skull Kid and the moon in the background? Wow, that immersed me pretty well, and I hadn't even started the game yet!
I loved the intro to this game. I love the Skull Kid's mischievous nature and how he just toys with Link's ocarina in the beginning. I thought it was cute and it made me laugh. Basically, the whole introduction of the game all the way till when you first enter clock town really brought me into the game in such a magnificent way. The Mask Salesman was rather hilarious with his quirky reaction to having his mask lost. Definitely really enjoyed this intro.
Exploring Clock Town was pretty nice as well. I liked seeing how intricate the town looked and discovering small things like the little lost fairy in the Laundry Pool and the kids who you had to catch. There was such a lively atmosphere that really made the town come alive. It was also rather cool to see a lot of the characters from OoT return in a unique way.
I believe the concept of time was brilliantly used in this game, more so than in OoT. I like that time wasn't always on your side and that you could have so much control over it. Having to go back over and over to do different tasks actually never really became all that tedious except maybe a few times in which I had to start over side quests.
The music in this game got stuck in my head more times than it needed to be, but I like that. The music for Clocktown never ceased to play in my head. It's such a catchy tune and definitely one of my favorites. Also, Final Hours has to be one of the creepiest and most surreal pieces of music I've heard in a game ever. You can practically feel that the world is about to end. I love it!
I really liked the Deku Palace. It's music was rather catchy as well and the story behind Woodfall Temple was very interesting too. I actually really liked beating the Woodfall Temple as i distinctly remember playing a good 2 hours just to fully beat the temple. I really like the Deku princess too. She was very well designed and I like how she played a major role in the whole Deku chapter of the game. The butler was pretty cool too, but it really occured to me just how sad the game was when in the credits I saw that he was next to a dead Deku. Most likely being his son, I couldn't help but feel bad for him.
Now I don't remember too much of getting to Snowhead Temple, but I know for sure that that dungeon got on my nerves a few times. Nonetheless, I still made it through pretty well, although slowly.
Now comes the part where I started to not like this game. Shocker I know. Getting to the Great Bay Temple was rather a hassle and it took me quite a while just to get to the Temple. It wasn't until I got to the temple itself that I found out why people called it the Water Temple of MM. It was hard, annoying, and very repetitive. It especially didn't help that I wasn't aware that if you reset the game from an owl save that you go back to your last Song of Time save. I swear, I had to get Gyorg's remains three times because I wasn't aware the owl statue ""policy"" was screwing me over. Not to mention that when I was going through that dungeon it was allergy season and my eyes were always itching like crazy. Not fun times.
After that, I was feeling rather indifferent about this game, not entirely sure whether or not I really like it. That is, it was until I got the Elegy of Emptiness, climbed the Stone Tower to the Temple, and almost beat the dungeon in the matter of one late night. It was the Stone Tower Temple and how well designed that dungeon was that made me like this game again. I liked the fact that when you turned the Temple upside down that it was a totally different experience. Of all 4 dungeons, I liked this one the most.
Now, getting all the heart pieces and Masks proved to definitely be worth my time. I really liked a lot of the mini-games in this game. Some were challenging and some were entertaining. None of them really lacked in creativity though, that's for sure.
I liked collecting all the masks too. People were right when they said that collecting the masks reveals so much more about the story revolving around the game. Probably my favorite side-quest of them all was the Anju and Kafei Quest. I'll admit, I had failed numerous times at the Sakon Hideout and had to start all over, but in the end, it was a really touching side quest. I also love how the Lover's Mask makes the connection between Anju's mother, to the Major of the town.
The Milk Bar has to be my favorite spot from Clock Town. It seems out of place yet at the same time, fit in in such a cool and captivating way. I love how the bartender can give you an ""alcoholic"" beverage that boosts your magic bar. Really cool.
Last and certainly not least, I really really like the Skull Kid. Whether it be his evil side influenced by Majora's Mask, or his friendly side that he shows with his fairy friends, I really liked him as a character. The first cutscene you get with the Skull Kid when he's out in the rain really made me feel something for him. Cold and alone in the rain, you couldn't help but feel bad for the guy. Definitely one of my favorite cutscenes from the game and seeing how happy the Skull Kid is with Tatl and Tael. (When I made the connection to ""tatle-tale"" it practically blew my mind lmao) At the very end, the Skull Kid just wants to be your friend. Also, he mentions that Link smells like the fairy boy that taught him a song. That connection especially blew my mind. I was beaming. Grinning ear to ear. I even loved the absolute end when you saw the drawing on the tree trunk of Link and the Skull Kid with the light Saria's Song tibit in the background.
All in all, there's so much more that I could go into detail about, but this is as much as I wanted to write. I loved this game a lot and if Nintendo ever makes a remake of this game I definitely will play it.",2,Skytch,True,t3_2fzrfn,0,ckf24vg,0,1427078168,

If you're confused about what it is, it's very similar to arena except obviously you can't randomly generate paper cards, so everyone at the table gets 3 boosters and you take 1 card and pass the booster along until all 42 cards have been drafted. The games actually play out a lot like arena games, where it's a lot more about the basic principle of card games - card advantage, board advantage, tempo etc. than constructed formats where you do really cool combos and synergies that twist the game.

Another thing to note is that the theory behind collecting is different in Magic. In hearthstone every deck will have at least a few commons and stuff like Zoo even plays quite a few. In magic, most of the commons are designed around limited formats like draft and are completely unplayable in a constructed format. This means if you want to get into constructed formats like Standard, you should be buying cards individually online rather than opening a booster pack.

Now, that being said, there are a handful of options or directions you can go and much of it depends on how much you want to spend.  I have several original M1923 cartridge belts that were designed for M1 Enbloc clips and would encourage you to do this too.  

There are new reproductions available, but they vary from cheap poorly made nylon copies for $30 to darn near indistinguishable from the original for $100.  

If you are not date specific for your cartridge belt, you can get an original in good shape for reasonably cheap.  The killer here is the collector market boosts the price on some dates and not others.  Briefly,  if you want just a functional cartridge belt for your M1, get something dated post WWII.  The WWII dated stuff, at least in Olive Drab No. 3 (OD3 or khaki) will set you back $100 or more, if you don't mind a Korean War era (or late WWII) belt in OD7 (olive drab no. 7 or dark green) you can get out for under $50 most often.  I just did an ebay search and found plenty of reasonable options.  

Ebay will also be one of the best sources for your buttstock cleaning kit.  I've been collecting this stuff for longer than I care to admit, and as far as these kits go, that's been the best source.  I never use them, they're just nice to have to complete the rifle.  I still use a modern cleaning kit with an aluminum rod so as not to damage my muzzle.

Then there's the bayonet issue.  How much do you want to spend?  Again reproductions can be had, but they are of what I'd say is ""questionable"" quality.  The best reproduction I have seen (in person) has been from [At The Front](http://www.atthefrontshop.com/searchresults.asp?cat=153), but it's still not perfect.  Here again if you seek out originals, date is huge as far as value goes.  There are 3 basic option for bayonets, 16"", 10"" and 6 3/4"".  The 16"" originals will run from $200-$500, 10"" run from $100-$150, and the 6 3/4"" come in close to $100 most of the time.

Key
- Strong stable Government
- Pay down debt
- Surpluses
- Reduce ACC levies
- $2.4 billon tax cuts from $1 billion
- Wages need to rise though we need to grow the economy first
- Doesn't like CGT based on selected studies which aren't considered as good as studies which support CGT  
- NZ on the cusp of something special, doesn't tell us what though

Cunliffe  
- Will build 100,000 affordable homes for Kiwi families
- CGT will clamp down on property speculation in NZ and create incentive to invest in productive profitable enterprise
- CGT details to be decided by expert panel after Labour is elected. Opposition doesn't have resources of Government required to create such detail
- Principal family home *never* subject to CGT. Nor is CGT a death or inheritance tax
- Labour's 3 pronged Economic Upgrade (can't recall details and am writing this from memory only) will provide the economic boost rewired to fund minimum wage rise
- $16.50 minimum wage will feed back into econimic upgrade further boosting economy
- Beststart will give parents $60/week per child for the 1st year of the baby's life
- It's Cunliffe's personal mission if elected PM to ensure hard data is collected on child poverty and to come back each year on Campbell Live and show how many children have been lifted out of poverty by Labour policy
- Wants to see New Zealand as the fairest most decent society in the world where all are equal  

What I take from this is all John Key really has is voting for him is voting for more of the same. 

Agreeing with John Key came across more as disagreeing with Cunliffe. We weren't agreeing with John's plan because he didn't remind us what it was. The only thing I learnt National would do is to lower ACC levies and maybe give tax cuts. The rest was all outcomes without plans to achieve them.

It's sad that if you don't like Labour, the best reason National gives for voting National, is that they're not Labour. ",9,ne1103b,True,t3_2g1ftq,0,cker4xc,0,1427084437,

Gameplay wise maybe gamemodes like finish the map in less jumps possible, finish the map while collecting all the things, turbo mode where you jump higher etc. I don't know yet! So many things I can add. Maybe a gamemode with random obstacles?

How can I get a booster pack?
Once you have received all of your card drops, you become eligible for a booster pack, which is a set of 3 trading cards that may include both basic and foil cards. Booster packs are granted randomly to eligible users as more badges are crafted by members of the community. Make sure you log in to Steam each week to maintain eligibility.

Once eligible, your Steam Level increases your rate of receiving a booster pack drop:

    Level 10: +20% increase in your drop rate
    Level 20: +40% increase in your drop rate
    Level 30: +60% increase in your drop rate
    Level 40: +80% increase in your drop rate
    Level 50: +100% increase in your drop rate (i.e. the rate has doubled)

• If you use Auto Reload holding M2 with postpone your reload until you let it go. This is especially useful for Scouts that don't want to waste a shell by prematurely reloading the Soda Popper or the Force-a-Nature.  
• If you are using a Headtaking weapon (Eyelander, Hitman, etc.) and kill an enemy using the same weapon you will get all of the heads that they have collected. This also works for the Airstrike. Their is currently a glitch where killing an Hitman Sniper or an Airstrike Soldier while using the Eyelander/Nessie/Headtaker will grant you their heads as well.  
• The Vaccinator is currently bugged in a way that makes the Medic and his heal target immune to critical hits. This includes headshots.  
• The Pomson and the Bison can light Huntsman Arrows on fire.  
• If you are just bumbling about during Setup Time and have nothing to do, quickly jump to Engineer and level up your team's teleporters to Level 3. This will give your team a good edge because your Engi will now focus on setting up his nest.  
• The Holy Mackerel will not say FISH KILL in the feed if you kill a Dead Ringer Spy. The Cleaner's Carbine will also not grant Minicrits for a DR Spy kill, and Spies who feigned death with the DR will not drop weapons that grant ammo/metal. If you kill a Spy and his weapon does not give you ammo he is Dead Ringing.  
• The Disciplinary Action has the longest Melee Weapon Range in the entire game, more than any of the Demoman's swords.  
• The Huntsman does significantly less damage if the string is pulled back too long. You can tell by looking at how shaky the Sniper's hands are.  
• A Level 2 teleporter will teleport people twice as fast than a Level 1, however a Level 3 will only shave off 2 more seconds of recharge time. Level 2's are a necessity, Level 3's are a luxury.  
• The Demoman's Explosives resistance granted by his shields do not protect him from his own explosions.  
• If a Soldier is on fire while using the BASE Jumper he will not float down. This can actually be used on command with a Cow Mangler charge shot.  
• Payload carts will not move any faster than X3. If you have X4 or onward it will move the same exact speed as 3.  
• Vaccinator and Kritz Ubers can be used while capping points or carrying Intel Briefcases, unlike the regular Ubercharge.  
• If a Heavy is holding a Sandvich and dies, the Sandvich he drops will heal any player who grabs it instead of granting ammo like weapons normally would.  
• The Jag is currently glitched in a way that negates it's only upside. You only save half of a second of buildtime for building a Sentry Gun, which is pretty much completely worthless. Check the wiki for a video comparison of it with the Stock Wrench.  
• The Neon Annihilator will crit any player who is wet, not just any player who is underwater. This includes players who have just exited water, who will have water drops coming off of them (which can also give away an invisible Spy btw), and any player soaked in Jarate or Mad Milk.  
• Bleed effects can stack, so if a Scout uses the Flying Guillotine and the Wrap Assassin at the same time you will take a staggering 16 damage every second.  
• If you hit someone three times with the Gunslinger, the third hit will be an assured Crit. It does not matter what team the player is one, so long as you hold down M1 for two hit the third will Crit. There is currently a glitch where holding down M2 will 'store' the Critical hit, meaning if you hold M1 for two hits on a friendly player and hold M2 so your third consecutive hit doesn't go away your next attack is an assured Critical hit.  
• A Sniper using Darwin's Danger Shield can survive a fully charged body shot and an uncharged headshot.  
• The Scout is at his fastest speed while maxing out the Baby Face's Blaster. Using the Crit-A-Cola while still having Max BFB boost will not increase your speed.  
• Eventhough it isn't listed, the Airstrike grants 25% less damage taken from Rocket Jumping.",23,_JackDoe_,True,t3_2fzwbd,0,ckeioj8,0,1427089418,

They are assigned a style on the base set cards (standard bronze/silver/gold/elite), but that may change in new cards sets.  Example Ha Ha Clinton-Dix base card is 77 OVR with +6 ZD.  The new rising star edition of the card has all four styles to choose from. If you collect them in the set you can get an even bigger boost for your preferred style. Like I use ZD for my style and collected two 80 OVR ZD HHC-D's to get the 83 OVR HHC-D with +18 ZD style so I could get over 90 and do the last ZD style challenge.

On point 1, That is definitely going to be fixed, working on another update. It's a number I forgot to change and didn't notice. 

Point 2. The effect was intentional, I tried the gradual increases and it just seemed to slow paced to keep the player occupied. I am still working on some of that, testing etc, but it's to the point of releasing.

Point 3. I'm experimenting with ways on how to do that, right now if you notice when you collect a boost the text ""Double tap to boost!"" appears on the left side. 

Point 4. That is definitely another thing I'm looking into, working on the fine tuning of that.

Point 5. The boost is supposed to be a ""use at your own risk"" system, it launches you with no preset landing (I.E safe landings etc). A feature to give the people that are close to their high scores something to beat with or just use it for fun.

Near the end of the first ""lap"" there's a sharp right turn just before entering the tunnel. Just before that turn, there a little ledge that's slightly above the rest of the edge on the right. If I remember correctly, it's right where the wall on the right ends. You can trick off that, and if you hit it while drifting you can cut that turn off entirely and shave a few seconds. The timing can be tricky though.

Next, during the hang-gliding segment, those flat ice rock looking platforms can be tricked off of to extend your glide time, as well as the bottom ledge in the water before the ramp.

Just before the left turn on the part where you're driving down the side of the Dam, there's a sudden drop on the grating that puts the racetrack on the floor's level. You can trick off of it. If you're really good, you can cut the right turn before that and jump over the hole in the inside of that right turn, then trick off the drop and drift immediately left onto the Dam.

Time the Anti-grav part so that you hit as many boosts as you can, but if you can't hit all three do not go out of your way to drive up or down to hit a boost. Going too far off a straight path to the next ramp will waste more time than the boost will give you, especially if you waste speed going up the current.

Right after that, you'll hit the wooded area where the path splits. There's actually a ramp in the middle. Take the right path to get closer to the center so as not to lose speed in the snow, but before it turns too far right and you pass the rock, use a mushroom to cut over the snow on the left and hit the ramp.

Trick off the logs. The rest of the trees are dicks, don't hit them.

Other than taking tighter turns and hitting all the boosts on the ski-ramp, the only advice I can give on the third ""lap"" is to use a mushroom to cut across the snow on the final turn just before the finish line.

I haven't done the math, but find the premium object that gives you the highest boost for the lowest cost and then spam it. It pays off if you're collecting 500,000 - 1,000,000 per day.

Another thing to consider is Krusty Land. Since the place can't be farmed, your income in tickets depends entirely on jobs. Otto, Sideshow Mel, Kearny and Hans Moleman can go to Krusty Land and earn you extra tickets on their jobs.

Akira can make bonsai trees in 3 12-hour tasks, which are themselves a premium item you'll be able to get for free.

Good scouts are infuriating anyway, bad scouts wont be able to use it to it's potential. 

The bigger stick is kind of gimmicky, the same way I see the Direct Hit. It feels like trading the ability to stay in combat longer for easier shots. Also possibly used as a sentry buster. OH and explosives destroying stickies is dumb, especially when they're as precise and instant as rockets.

We'd have to get beta detonator back for the kabutowari to be useful. 

Tartarus feels like the kind of weapon I'd change servers from. My teammate got pilled, and because of that, the splash hit me and did more damage. Add teammates until you potentially die to one pill (hi loch)

The Gatling shotgun feels gimmicky too, just thrown out there for people who desperately want fat scout to not suck. Out of any of these, this weapon seems the least outrageous. 

The double trouble... ""Health Collected"" can't mean from medics and dispensers too, because that would op as fuck. 1 med = infinite metal. But if it includes them, the no health pickup downside is negligible. What engi wont have a dispenser? Also, hope you like encountering full level 3 nests out of setup. This shotgun would make it easy. Easily the most unbalanced. 

The shock surgery's uber is weaker than the stock AND quick fix. Both provide 360° of protection, while this is a single direction that everyone has to stay behind. Way too good in some circumstances, fantastically awful in others. Also, there's a reason overheal decays at the current rate. Having a scout run around above 125 for 50% longer is a O to the P. If it keeps longer overheal, then max overheal needs to be decreased. 

I say the heatwave speed boost be 107%, instead of 112%. That's all.

This is actually an amazing combination, as it allows me to terrify my opponents and then become the physical manifestation of their fear. Assuming that none of my enemies are immune to my fear breath (which would be kinda lame) I have the ability to become stronger and stronger and become a terrifying force of destruction relative to whoever I am fighting. This is simply fantastic. If I'm fighting a group, I become the sum of all of their fears. The sight of such a terrifying opponent scares them even more and gives me essentially limitless power, as I become more and more frightening and dangerous.

1.**Batman**: I unleash my fear breath, and become Emperor Joker fused with a giant bat. GG

2.**Captain America**: I fly to Captain America and become a massive cyborg Joseph Stalin with a live human shield made of all the US Presidents. Cap doesn't stand a chance.

3.**Ironman**: I become a terrorist who threatens to destroy every major city in the world with Tony's weapons unless he turns himself in. Since he's all about self sacrifice, he'll probably do it, but even if he tries to stop me, I'll become a stronger, better Ironman than him.

4.**Wolverine**: I become a stronger version of Magneto and shred him apart.

5.**The Kanto Elite 4 and all their Pokemon at the same time**: I become the collective nightmare of the entire group. I have no idea what that would be in Pokemon terms, but it's big and bad and kills them all.

6.**Mewtwo joins the Battle!**: I become MewThree, a stronger version of him superior in every way.

7.**Captain America , Colossus, Quick Silver, Venom, and Spider-man all rush you**: I become a hulking, monstrous, communist, mutation-canceling beast that nullifies their powers and reduces them to ordinary humans that I simply smash.

8.**Samus (Metroid Series)**I become a powered up hybrid of Dark Samus and the Seven Hunters and gun her down.

9.**Zoro (One Piece)**: I don't know much about One Piece, but I become the embodiment of whatever Zoro fears.

10.**Monkey D. Luffy(One Piece)** Same as Zoro

11.**Trafalgar Law (One Piece)** Same as Zoro

12.**Monkey D. Luffy and Trafalgar Law team up.** (One Piece) The way I understand my powers to work is that if I am fighting a group, I become the sum of their fears, whatever that may be.

13.**Whitebeard (One Piece)** Same as Zoro

14.**Dr.Doom and Mewtwo just became bros.** A hybrid of MewThree and a bloodlusted Fantastic Four

15.**Dr.Doom has a team of Pokemon. Although he him self won't fight. 
Mewtwo , Lugia , Genesect , Cobalion, Aggron, Wobbufet.** MewThree might be sufficient, I don't know. Prep time could be an advantage for me. Since my form always changes, they won't know what to expect, and whatever they prepare for, I'll be the one thing they weren't prepared for.


16.**Bowser has access to any Power up/Magic he's ever used. Except the Star Rod making him invincible. (Nintendo)** I become a bigger Bowser with the Star Rod.

17.**Eggman and Dr.Wily team up and create a clone of you.** This is tricky. Since I know exactly what I'm dealing with, I may be less afraid of him then he would be of me. I've also got more experience with transforming, and assuming we both don't infinitely scale up into a stalemate I might be able to beat him quickly with my superior experience.

18.**Mecha Superman** - This is a Robot used to be able to take out Superman. It has his a constant increasing Super Strength, Speed, and Durability. It's not invincible. But It's immune to Heat Vision and Frost Breath. I'm not sure if robots can be scared, but I could become some kind of crippling super-virus that shuts him down. I could also become Mecha Doomsday maybe.

19.**4,000 Sentinels**: The larger the group, the stronger I am from the sum of their fears. Whatever I become is more than enough to smash them


20.**Captain SkyMerica:** If they've heard of what I've become in the past then I'm sure they're afraid of me, anyone reasonable would be. I become a giant Sith Communist Darth Maul and take him down.

21.**30,000 Heartless and Nobodies:** don't know who they are, but group fighting boost is overwhelming

22.**Organization XII:** same as above

23.**Dragonite:**  No idea what it fears, but that's what I am

24.**Little Mac (Punch-Out) just got Superman's Invincibility, Speed Force, and Adamantium bones.** No idea, but same as above

25.**Galactus: This bastard just smoked a whoooooooole lot of weed.** I become Officer Franklin Richards with a search warrant and confiscate his stash. Auto-win.

26.**Thanos:** Thanos suffers from a crippling lack of confidence in his own abilities. He subconciously thinks he can't win, and so as he fights me, I'll slowly take the advantage and overwhelm him. Or maybe I just turn into Galactus and eat him.

27.**Shulk** He's literally a god. So I guess I become a higher god that unwinds everything that he has created and then remove his deity status and obliterate him.",4,AFatBlackMan,True,t3_2fwjtq,0,ckdk2a8,0,1427107520,

Adding:

* [Hitsugi no Chaika](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20853/Hitsugi_no_Chaika) - Chaika's goal is to collect the preserved body parts of her late father, the despised and overthrown emperor, who was a powerful sorcerer (therefore, his body parts serve as magical boosters), so she can give him a proper burial. The problem is that his body parts are currently held/guarded by some of the country's most powerful people. A [second season](http://myanimelist.net/anime/24231/Hitsugi_no_Chaika:_Avenging_Battle) is scheduled to air this fall. 
* [Magi: The Labyrinth of Magic](http://myanimelist.net/anime/14513/Magi:_The_Labyrinth_of_Magic) - Features dungeons that people can challenge, and if they succeed in ""capturing"" the dungeon, will become a King's Candidate and become master of a powerful Djinn. This aspect of it becomes a bit less prominent as the series goes on, though. Has a [second season](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18115/Magi:_The_Kingdom_of_Magic).
* [Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle](http://myanimelist.net/anime/177/Tsubasa_Chronicle) - The characters set out to collect Princess Sakura's lost feathers - pieces of her soul - scattered across other dimensions and parallel worlds.

The zombie genre has gotten a serious boost to its popularity in the last ten years thanks to comics like The Walking Dead and remake movies like Dawn of the Dead. Which is good, the genre deserves more attention.

But just like with every other horror sub-genre, the popularity of the zombie genre draws a bunch of ass hats out of their cages. People who collect airsoft weapons despite being nearly thirty years old. Gun nuts who collect actual guns that one might expect to see in a John Woo movie and always seem to have more guns than they do ammo for those guns.

Just spend some time on the subreddit /r/zombies and you will see the fun and intellectual posts are few and far between. Every other post is a picture of the zombie hunting permit sticker someone spotted on a car at the mall while they were on their way to their job at Spencers or Cinnabon. 

Any significant popularity of a horror sub-genre leads to an influx of ass hats who ruin the sub-genre and then downvote anyone who criticizes the sub-genre for the festival of morons it has become. 

Zombies isn't the only sub-genre to suffer this fate in recent years. Torture porn has been suffering it as well. Anyone can make torture porn now, and it doesn't even have to be any good. American haunting films are popular too, like Sinister and The Haunting in Connecticut.

However the game was completely ruined by the F2P implementation. If I weren't a fan of the franchise and the game wasn't so good I would've abandoned ship a lot sooner.

Even when I was playing everything felt like a chore. XP gain was nerfed drastically to get you to buy XP boosts, you moved slowly to get you to buy speed boosts, the game was based around collecting demons and you had to pay for storage (imagine if you had to pay monthly per box in Bill's PC in Pokemon), crafting chances were garbage unless you bought cash shop items, everything in what could've been a fantastic game was broken so they could charge you per mechanic to temporarily fix it.

There are countless examples of good games ruined by terrible monetization. Look at many Perfect World titles. They've earned a bad reputation. Look at Allods online which was highly praised then lost many players when they implemented cursed items to constantly suck money out of players by cursing their gear every time they died to force them to buy a cash shop item to fix it.

There are many games that are not worth playing because of their monetization and would be wonderful if that were different.",3,RageX,True,t3_2fumbo,0,ckd8dwy,0,1427113396,

'Cause I've looked around a bit in the past (and just now), and I can't seem to find anything that *requires* a certain amount be spent. There's pressure from various groups (the US, various NATO leaders, etc) to raise spending, but it seems it's ultimately up to the members nations as to whether they'll boost spending.

The only strict requirement, as far as I can tell, is that you be able to contribute to a defensive effort in the event Article V is invoked. That could be anywhere from intelligence and logistics, to deployment of military forces. The oft-quoted 2% of GDP 'requirement' (which I feel is reasonable for *wealthier* countries) is more like a guideline. You won't get kicked out because you're not spending that much. Heck, Iceland doesn't even have a real military, and they're in NATO. . .purely because of strategic concerns.

And just for people's information, the countries that spend 2% or near it/above it are: US, UK, France, Greece, Estonia, Turkey, and Poland. In the case of Estonia, I think that's a recent boost in spending and it still doesn't amount to a ton of actual money (just under 500 million dollars). They don't have a lot of heavy equipment. . .no tanks, relatively few IFVs and APCs, almost nonexistent airforce, etc. Every other country in that list has a respectable amount of military power, relatively speaking.

*Collectively*, the European NATO nations (especially with Turkey in the mix) have enough firepower to handle Russia in a conventional fight. There's no real question of that. They outclass and outnumber Russia's conventional military. The major sources of power would be the countries I listed above, along with Germany and some other Western European nations, and possibly Romania and Bulgaria (both have militaries like Ukraine or Poland. . .a mix of older Soviet stuff along with newer equipment).

We used to build games that were pressed on discs, shipped to retailers, bought by consumers and then, in the months and years that followed, we'd support them the best we could. We updated playlists, made tuning changes, and developed new multiplayer maps.

With Destiny, we couldn't create a world that players want to live in by leveraging our old habits. We want to improve, grow and evolve Destiny in the coming weeks, months and - hopefully - years. 
  
The hours you poured into the beta were instructive, the feedback you provided was heard, and the time you've spent with us so far is humbling. 
  
Patch 1.0.1 won't be the last changes to Destiny. Our goal is to constantly improve the Live game. The game we hope is competing for your free time. 
  
Work is already underway on upcoming patches. Some will contain new content, some will contain the next round of improvements, and some will undoubtedly react to issues that you - the playerbase - will uncover in the coming weeks. 
We're just getting started. 
  
Summary: 
The Day One patch for Destiny contains a number of changes to Weapons, Builds, Talents, Maps, Activities, Achievements, Progression, game stability and UI.

We updated playlists, made tuning changes, and developed new multiplayer maps.

With Destiny, we couldn't create a world that players want to live in by leveraging our old habits. We want to improve, grow and evolve Destiny in the coming weeks, months and - hopefully - years. 
  
The hours you poured into the beta were instructive, the feedback you provided was heard, and the time you've spent with us so far is humbling. 
  
Patch 1.0.1 won't be the last changes to Destiny. Our goal is to constantly improve the Live game. The game we hope is competing for your free time. 
  
Work is already underway on upcoming patches. Some will contain new content, some will contain the next round of improvements, and some will undoubtedly react to issues that you - the playerbase - will uncover in the coming weeks. 
We're just getting started.

&gt;
&gt;Courtesy of the Ninja Team and their lethal needlework, these spectacular shoulder-huggers come in four varieties, each showing your expertise in a group of linked skills.
&gt;
&gt;Artisan's Cape	Combatant's Cape	Gatherer's Cape	Support Cape
&gt;To get your hands on these capes, you'll need level 99 in a number of skills:

&gt;Artisan's cape:
&gt;
&gt;Cooking
&gt;
&gt;Construction
&gt;
&gt;Crafting
&gt;
&gt;Firemaking
&gt;
&gt;Fletching
&gt;

&gt;

&gt;
&gt;Dungeoneering
&gt;
&gt;Slayer
&gt;
&gt;Thieving
&gt;
&gt;While training the above skills at level 99, via certain commonly used methods, you'll occasionally see a skill shard appear in your inventory.
&gt;
&gt;Once you have a shard for each of your coveted cape's related skills, simply combine them. Then, drape yourself in silky splendour and continue with your adventures!
&gt;
&gt;Expert skillcapes have the same stats as regular skillcapes and come with a cosmetic hood. They can also boost all of their related skills to 100 for a short time. Finally, each has its own lavishly animated emote.
&gt;
&gt;They can be stored in the costume room of your player-owned house, and can be retrieved from Diango if lost.
&gt;
&gt;Have Fun!
&gt;
&gt;It's a long road to maxed, so why not pick up some stylish threads on the way? Get collecting those shards, and give us your thoughts over on the forums.

&gt;In Other News
&gt;
&gt;We've made a number of changes to the Wealth Evaluator, so it can now more accurately represent your wealth:
&gt;
&gt;Untradeable wealth is no longer included in the calculation by default. It can be toggled back on via the Wealth Evaluator interface.
&gt;
&gt;Bonds held in the Bonds Pouch are now included. Note that untradeable Bonds will not be counted unless the option mentioned above is toggled on.
&gt;
&gt;Contribution from battle mage, trickster and vanguard armour has been reduced.
It is now possible to top up your Wealth Evaluator in-game, using your RuneCoin balance. You can do this in the Wealth Evaluator interface.

0,,t1_ckckun4,1,1410195157,,t3_2fseeb,False,diablo3,False,,t5_2qjhk,"I played Diablo 2 a lot back in the day and I got D3 at release. I played it for a while, got to the end game but HATED how impossible it was to get the end game DPS gear. The drop rates were so low that there was literally no chance to collect the gear you wanted: you had to buy it. Eventually this turned me off and I stopped playing and uninstalled. Recently I heard about the changes and had a few dollars around so I bought RoS and have been thrilled; It feels more like D2 than ever. There is basically no trading, so you have to grind your own gear, and to make that possible they massively boosted the drop rates on legendaries and made items you ID very likely to have stats you want. This makes it very satisfying to grind for a drop, since it may take you a day or a week to get it (as opposed to years) and it will probably have at least a decent roll.

I like that you'll see a handful of legendaries every hour of grinding, even if most of them are not upgrades to your gear. This is how d2 was: grind mephisto or diablo or baal and see a unique or two drop each time, but only rarely is it the specific thing you're looking for.

I also love the new features on legendaries. Some of the properties are really creative and interesting, and some are insanely powerful. [Look at the legendary sword and shield combination in this popular build](http://eu.battle.net/d3/en/profile/KingKongor-2672/hero/47312971)",1,InexplicableContent,True,t3_2fseeb,0,ckckun4,0,1427124618,

[The End Goal]
Second, your end-goal is to have 5-Piece Akkhan and Leoric's Crown. 

Since you're missing CDR on your shield, you will likely need to put 8% CDR on both your rings (or find a way to wedge it onto an amulet). Your goal is 55-56% (technically 55.6%) CDR.

[Stuff You Can Make Yourself]
While you collect your Akkhan pieces, there are things you can actively make and get:

* RROG: You will want to find one that has STR+LPH+ASPD+Socket, rerolling LPH to CDR+8%.
* Captain Crimson Belt and Pants: These will get you a boost to CDR until you get Leoric's Crown + Vigilante Belt.
* Reaper's Wraps: There is no substitute for this in Wrath-Heavy builds. Holy/STR/VIT/Crit.

[Sockets and Legendary Gems]
They are your friends. You want every slot to have a socket. Having the socket also gives you synergy with Finery. It's a win-win situation. You may have to throw away a key stat for it like Crit (See RROG above), but the gems add more damage than you'd lose. 

* Bane of the Trapped is amazing once you level it to 25. It does about a 23% damage boost almost all the time. 
* Bane of the Powerful is nice because you get 15% elite damage along with a 20% boost after killing elites.
* I have a personal preference for Mirinae because it will proc off of the Condemn Procs.

[Stats]
It's important to stay balanced on CC and CHD. If you can keep 1% crit for 10% damage, you will be in good shape. You ideally want to roll max Crit on anything that can roll crit, and make CHD on anything that can roll CHD. If you can magically wedge Holy onto a necklace, you probably will want to do that.

On your Akkhan body piece, STR/VIT/Condemn+15% is the way to go. If you can manage to get shoulders with STR/VIT/CDR+8%/Condemn+15%, do that.

[Murderous Cut](http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/ktk/8arg43u984398yf/en_1zoro0dvow.png) is easily a first pickable uncommon, and honestly I think it will end up being constructed playable, assuming there is enough Delve fuel. Some sort of cantrip, or god forbid a Mental Note, would make this instantly playable. 

A [new cycle of ""Refuges""](http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/developing-khans-2014-09-08) in common? Sign me up! This should be a great boon to limited. Panoramas were nice and all, but ultimately only ""producing"" one color at a time still felt like it choked your mana. 

[Trail of Mystery](http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/ktk/8arg43u984398yf/en_sngrjqi8kp.png) looks cute, but still feels just an ounce too narrow (or an ounce too weak to warrant how narrow it is) to see legitimate play.

[Ashcloud Phoenix](http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/ktk/8arg43u984398yf/en_uvhggfnjds.png) is a cool take on the Phoenix mechanic but I think is a little underwhelming on the power side. I think it's problem is it doesn't fit too well in the curve anywhere (4 mana without haste walks into Wrath / the exiling removal too much). 

[Pearl Lake Ancient](http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/ktk/8arg43u984398yf/en_x4p59deuyk.png). Flash, uncounterable, fairly unkillable (in the right deck)? Yeah, that busts control pretty hard. Too bad that it's ripe for a Thoughtseizing for many many turns and gets chumped for days once it's down. 

[Adamant Negation](http://www.magicspoiler.com/mtg-spoiler/adamant-negation/). Well, hello, there. How often does Goyf trigger Ferocious? Because that determines how playable this card is.

As a 4 drop, it will often run right into the Wrath, but a) you will probably drop it early, as you're green, and b) you'll at least have the lasting value. Most things that kill this don't gain tempo by doing so, as well. 

I was hoping that [Jeskai Charm](https://twitter.com/wizards_magic/status/509045639729016832/photo/1) would be more control friendly, but this card is definitely a boost to aggro and tempo strategies. ",19,llikeafoxx,True,t3_2ft7tu,0,ckcia8s,0,1427125815,

Is the owner of a factory in Illinois who lives in California ""proximate"" to the growth? Is the marketing firm that creates the awesome new ad that boosts demand? The guy who writes the ad copy? The laborer who physically puts her hands on the product before it goes into the box?

Growth == rise in output

Proximate == economically proximate. All of those you listed would be proximate actors.

Both are fairly common terms, i'm surprised you have not encountered them previously.

&gt; Sorry, there's effectively no mobility America today

Your own source does not agree with that point, read it again. No change in mobility does not equal no mobility.

&gt; and mobility has been going down as the effects of the ""miracle"" of unsecured consumer credit (one of the ""products"" of the ""well-functioning credit markets"" you mentioned) has borne fruit.

Where did you get this idea from? First it is [wrong](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/_files/jd25763/handbook_mobility.pdf) (also [here](http://www.nber.org/papers/w17435.pdf) and [here](http://obs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/chetty/tax_expenditure_soi_whitepaper.pdf)) and second you are making two competing arguments, mobility can't be both static and falling at the same time.

&gt; This is only true if we take your asserted but not proven statements above as givens. If you're right about everything that precedes this statement,"" then this statement is true. If you're mistaken about *any part of your worldview - any part whatsoever - then this statement is absolutely false. What's more likely: that in about 200 years of modern economics all the fundamental truths of it have been figured out 100% correctly, or that there's an error (or omission or lie or misdirection) somewhere that makes the whole thing not as you've presented it?

Marginalism is axiomatic in precisely the same way gravity and light are, they can be observed to exist a priori. It can also be demonstrated to exist a posteriori via experimentation, the very fact you own things and those things exceed the resource input to produce them is itself an a priori demonstration of marginalism.

Further if you are going to contest marginalism then your concern regarding mobility is pointless as without marginalism mobility does not exist.

&gt; Workers are paid for adding value. That's what 1 guy working as a solo contractor gets paid for, that's what 1 guy in a 1,000-worker factory gets paid for. It's just that the former guy can capture almost all of the value he creates, and the latter guy typically can only capture what the owner of the factory says he can have (and you can bet your bottom dollar that amount is well below the actual value added - otherwise the factory would go out of business).

Hello LTV, we got rid off you well over a century ago but people on the internet keep bringing you back to life.

You have now jumped from the heterodox through to the absurd, even modern Marxian economists don't try to maintain LTV as its so trivial to demonstrate to be wrong (again, you own things that exceed their resource input in cost. You desire some things more then others with no correlation between their value and your utility of them).

&gt; If we did put it aside, are you promising it'll come back? Nowhere past this point did you bring morality back into the conversation. The only thing that means anything is morality. Otherwise we're just dumb brutes wandering around trying to get the shiniest objects.

Morality is meaningless, its subjective in an objective world.

There are many things people morally consider to be wrong or right but objectively are the opposite. Many people morally oppose gays having equal rights as everyone else, should we form the basis of society on this morality or the morality that doing so is repugnant? Objectively answers exist for all questions of our social &amp; economic system, basing how that system is shaped on the subjective whims of a few is repugnant.

Also you don't seem to understand what outcome means, who said anything about outcomes not meaning things like income redistribution and social welfare? You are attempting to strawman the argument in to being one of always pro-wealthy when I have not done that in the slightest.

&gt; For example, this turns what should be a moral dagger in the heart of your favored system into a cold objective measure of its effectiveness. People starving in the streets isn't the same as a bolt shearing off during high-g turns. People starving in the streets is people, real human beings just like your mother or father or grandparents or anyone you've ever had a real, personal connection with. Literally it is someone's child. That's not a ""market failure,"" and rebranding it as such is only necessary to move the amoral system you're selling.

Really, how should we choose the most effective mechanism of helping those people if we are not going to care about outcomes and why they are in that position in the first place?

In your ill-informed subjective position programs like SNAP are effective means of poverty control, objectively we understand alternative programs such as the NIT manage destition without creating poverty. Further if you don't care about outcomes then the problem of people starving on the streets can be resolved by killing them all, its ok; the person doing it doesn't consider it to be immoral to murder the poor.

&gt; Asserted but not proved.

[Seriously, you are contesting common knowledge now?](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/documents/quarterlybulletin/2014/qb14q1prereleasemoneycreation.pdf)

Is evolution next?

&gt; This is key, I think. You're talking about ""employment"" as if it's a fundamental good. What was before ""employment?"" Family farms, homesteading, whatever. It wasn't glamorous, and we hadn't mastered things like medicine, electricity, etc. Indeed, some of the cool technology we have is a product of ""employment."" But it's not necessarily the case that ""more employment"" is good.

Yes, yes it is. Unless you really don't care about mobility and higher wages, in which case it may not be.

&gt; But as soon as one of them hires an employee, they start charging rents. The employee cannot possibly capture as much of the value added by woodworking as the solo contractor could, because the employer has overhead costs.

Why would the employee work for someone else if the exchange is an effective loss? How about economy of scale effects, larger market effects and various other effects that only exist because of the collective employment of the organization and act as a productivity multiplier?

&gt; I guess that's a bit of a tangent, but it's clearly the case that when you have a large separation between the owner and the laborer, and when you have lots and lots of laborers working for one owner, it's more and more likely that the result will be ""skimming off wages of labor.""

Only if you pretend S&amp;D don't exist.

&gt; Well, setting aside the fact that your first statement is false (e.g. ""efficiency experts"" have been increasing wealth for decades by lowering costs without changing demand), neither does the need to increase demand necessarily mean that it's in the interests of the owners to increase the wealth of laborers. You can just (capture control of the government to) open new markets. Or find laborers who will work more cheaply. Guess what owners have been working on since the 1970s?

Outsourcing increases local wages rather then decreasing them, it creates upwards pressure on local skills while reducing prices. [Even importing](http://economics.ucdavis.edu/people/gperi/site/papers/peri_shih_sparber_05_feb_2013_TEMPO.pdf) low cost labor has the same effect.

&gt; People don't have unlimited wants. There is very strong research that shows that once you've met a certain level of material comfort, people start pursuing non-material ends. Forbes has an article along these lines[2] .

No there is not, you are discussing falling marginal utility (which is strange, why are you making a marginalism argument when you reject marginalism?) and confusing demand and want. Wants are infinite, demand is not. The utility for further income is less then the utility of leisure time so people stop seeking more work, offering people anything they want for free would still result in an endless list of things they want.

The only downside to the build is it feels a little ""weird"" not having any wrath generating attacks. Just for your own sanity though try the build both ways, a couple of runs with provoke as a main wrath generator and a couple of runs replacing it with a ""primary"" skill... you'll probably actually come to appreciate provoke. I don't include AC in wrath generation above because at the start you definitely won't have enough CDR or set pieces to reduce it to any meaningful number, it'll be a clicky for rare groups.  

Right off the bat though craft some Reaper Wraps, they'll last you well into gearing with your set. Enchant them with fire damage for the hammer build and it'll be a nice start. Ring of Royal Grandeur drops like cake now so do some A1 split bounty groups.. T2 preferably but if you have to start on T1 (just a substantially less drop chance from horadic caches) then that will be fine as you still need to collect Blood Shards for gambling.  

I'd maybe do a few T1 rifts just to get some gems as most of them even at level 1 will be a pretty big DPS boost, then focus on split bounties. That will be your life for quite awhile gambling set pieces (ignore gambling weapons for now). It may come off as boring but Crusaders (can't comment on the other classes) are near useless without their set simply because AC being up 100% of the time versus not is a huge 180 in the class. I've gambled almost 4000 shards and haven't gotten any set pieces yet so you could possibly be looking forward to that :(  

As for what to gamble first, personally gloves seemed to be hardest to fill via legendary.  

Once you get your set pieces your weapon/shield will mainly dictate what build to go next. By the time you've ran 80,000 bounties hopefully you will have picked up a few and can go based on preference. ",1,marinuss,True,t3_2frhal,0,ckcaclh,0,1427130185,

That sounds incredibly boring. That's bad CCG design, for reasons talked about in that article I won't bother repeating.

&gt; Especially with booster packs and stuff, just being lucky getting some good cards in a booster packs or bad cards feels meh.

CCGs may not be for you. If you always get average cards, where's the excitement? Arguments can be made about that rarity ratio in HS, sure (I think the fact that it seems like more than half of packs are just 40 dusters is a little silly, but that has nothing to do with card value, just that it takes like 2 months to collect a vast majority of commons). You need to sometimes get bad cards to make it more exciting when you get good cards. That's just how CCGs work. 

&gt; Is this truly an argument?

It's not just an argument, it's a proven tenant of game design. I mean M:tG isn't popular for nothing, the guy who wrote that article works on Magic and speaks from a lot experience, extensive testing, surveys, etc. Clearly Team 5 understands this concept as well because Hearthstone is a popular game very much due to this ""discovery"" concept. Like Mind Control kinda sucks at 10 mana, but Ben talked about this and made a very good point. Those cards suck you into the game. Like ""WOAH I CAN CONTROL AN OPPONENT'S MINION."" This is kind of a tangent but this ""discovery"" concept applies so much. You open a pack, woah a card with 5 attack for only 3 mana? And it looks badass too? Man, gotta try it right? Well there need to be bad cards to discover they're bad, just like they need to discover how good cards like Flame Imp and Yeti etc are. Some people will read guides online, but many won't, and just play and figure it out as they go. Team 5 needs to think about these players too.

&gt; Besides, I felt War Golem was bad the moment I saw it, it only had 1 more attack than Boulderfist, it just seemed weird.

Yeah, but that was an experience you had. It seems you already perhaps somewhat understood ""value"" by that point, but not everyone (myself included) makes that connection right away and doesn't get that +1 attack isn't worth an extra mana. Hell, those two cards in particular could have even been made specifically that way to teach people about value. So they eventually have that thought process you had and start thinking that way about all the cards.

The hooks right off the bat are a technical anomaly. However, it's shown that the hooks open up once they dig into a surface. I can assume that there's some sort of trigger in the hooks that can sense the halt in motion and deploy the extra hold on the surface. However, when they recall the hook, it's shown that this support retracts. From there, I can guess a few things:

-There's a spring-loaded mechanism that shoots the arms of the hook into the surface. Considering the size of the hooks aren't consistently shown, I can't tell for sure if there's room in the hook for this to be the case.

-When the release trigger is pulled, a secondary wire inside the line is pulled before the line starts flying back. This wire reloads the spring mechanism in the hooks, and allows it to slide out of it's spot in the wall. This would probably be separate from the retract trigger, as they seem to reel in their lines as a primary form of gaining momentum.

-In order to pierce into strong materials quickly, effectively, and repetitively, the hook itself needs to be made out of a sufficiently hard material. Carbon-alloy steel would at first glance be the best choice, as it's one of the hardest alloys on the planet. However, another option could be tungsten carbide, which is the hardest known metal alloy at present, commonly used in drill bits and surgical tools, and is very resistant to abrasion and high temperatures. It's not impossible that the AOT-universe has access to tungsten, as tungsten itself was discovered sometime in the 16th century, so it's not completely unlikely that the hooks could be made of that material. Even if it were a carbon-alloy steel, a sufficiently sturdy hook could be used to pierce wood, flesh, maybe stone and some types brick, though the last two would dull down the hooks far quicker than the first two. It's worth noting that you never see materials other than these being latched into, so it's likely that the hooks simply don't work on stronger materials.

-The hooks are going at an insane speed when launching. That's pretty obvious, but the issue is there's no explanation for how the hooks gain that momentum, only that they get retracted by a simple reel. However, we have something in real life that operates similar to this: Airsoft guns. I'd imagine they could use the same mechanic on a more powerful scale to propel the hooks at a high enough speed to penetrate the surface it's launching at. An alternative is the hooks are reliant on the compressed air tanks used to gain momentum when swinging, which could also explain why they weren't able to use the 3DMG and simply swing down behind the titans in the supply room.

-Aiming the hooks is done by angling the user's pelvis in the desired direction of the hook and pressing the trigger. This would be harder when in full motion and spinning around, but it can be done.



Now, as far as actually using the gear, I'll assume that the user is moving at around 30-40 MPH. Reaction time in this actually pretty good, as people riding on horseback can experience higher speeds than this safely. For propelling the person, I can imagine momentum and the reels for the wires would be doing most of the work propelling the user, with large bursts of gas being used more to gain quick boosts of speed in their swings, slow themselves down safely, or change their direction than to singlehandedly propel the user(While there are scenes where the person is at a standstill before using the gear, the majority of the speed would be coming from the lines retracting, with the compressed air being used to gain or regain momentum) Furthermore, the belts covering the user distribute the control of their movements across their entire body, instead of just being centered around where the gear is attached to them. This means the users need a huge amount of muscle in their legs, hips, core and shoulders, and they have to know how to use those muscle groups collectively in to keep themselves from flailing around helplessly. Thus the aptitude tests, which check to make sure the soldiers can learn the positioning to maintain their balance and keep themselves in an upright position. While they're seldom flying in said position, the logic helps them maintain control of themselves and their gear.



With all that said, I don't think much work would be done to build a real life version of the 3DMG, as the mortality rate that would amount from testing and training would be too high. Even if somebody were to make it, there's almost nowhere you could use it. However, in terms of possibility, I'd say that if they managed to make the hook mechanism, then it's definitely plausible.",3,CogChoir,True,t3_2fq7pi,0,ckbx72f,0,1427138602,

Throwing tea into a harbour probably broke a world record for making the biggest cup of tea ever, though if there is one statement guaranteed to rile a Briton, it is the unnecessary waste of perfectly good tea.

So - simple enough, but the lead up is a bit more complex. The East India Company actually wanted to sell the tea to all of the colonies at a cut-rate to boost its flagging profits. However, taxes on the tea would have to be paid to the British the instant the tea was unloaded in Boston harbour. And the Colonies had a long-standing problem with paying taxes to Britain when they had no representatives in British parliament. Offering discount tea while still collecting the tax on it was viewed by the Colonists as a trick to get them to agree to parliament's authority over them.

Protesters turned back ships carrying tea to New York and Philadelphia, and if that had happened in Boston, the problem would have been solved. Unfortunately, the governor of Boston wouldn't let the tea ships leave once they were in the harbour. I guess he figured the public would come 'round eventually and just pay the tax - because everyone likes a bargain - but that never happened. In fact, protests got bigger and bigger until a meeting at the Old South Meeting House. A mob broke away from the crowd there and dumped the tea, solving the impasse, and wasting the tea.

(I shuddered as I wrote that)

The British reacted to the protest by sending British troops under Thomas Gage to occupy the town. They also closed the Boston Harbour, part of several laws they created to punish the Colonists that were dubbed the ""Coercive Acts"". Of course, these laws didn't gain them any sympathy with the Colonists - and led fairly directly to the outbreak of the Revolution.

Lord: Ike. Little else needs be said. Ike is absolutely incredible across both of his games, as a characters and a unit. He utterly destroys every single chapter he is in, and I absolutely adore his personality, too. Caps of 37/40/37/32(+5) in Str/Skl/Spd/Def should be illegal. Second goes to... Chrom or Ephraim or Eliwood.

Fighter: Boyd. On my first play through of PoR, I had just dealt with FE7 and FE8 having the slowest fighters *ever*. I began to think that Vaike was the exception to the rule of all fighters sucking (Awakening was my first game, and Vaike's a damned monster). Imagine my surprise when I find myself a fighter with a *45%* speed growth. Boyd is incredible, and that's in both games. My first pick in the Tellius draft (which I, sadly, could not complete), and for good reason. He's a cool guy (his character, as established in PoR and, to a lesser extent, RD, is really quite lovable). On subsequent playthroughs of PoR, I played on Fixed Mode, and Boyd is incredible on that, simply because the Paladin band makes it so that he, without fail, gets speed every other level. Combine that with his comically high strength, and he's the best unit in the game to get something dead until Ragnell Ike comes along (though Aether Ike might also do it). He doesn't need to worry about his durability, as a) it's not that bad, and b) he'll have a support with Mist, who can heal him. He's also amazing in RD. My Reaver of choice (sorry, Nolan), and for good reason. Second goes to Vaike, Orsin or Barst.

Cavalier/Paladin/Great Knight: I couldn't choose, honestly. Sully, Stahl, Oscar, Kent and Franz are all awesome people and units. Alan and Lance get honourable mentions for being the only good units in FE6 (exaggeration), and Frey and Cain are pretty cool, too.

Knight/General: Gatrie. He's the best typical knight in FE9 (*massive* strength and defense), and he has the Knight Ward to boost his speed. Come FE10, though, and he's undeniably the best General in the game, and, in my opinion, the series. 60% speed growth. *60%*. That's ludicrous, and his strength and defence don't suffer for it. I'm also a sucker for his character. Second would have to be Draug or Oswin.

Myrmidon/Swordmaster: Edward. The destroyer of worlds. 60/65/60 Str/Skl/Spd growths make him utterly insane in battle, and, should his incredible dodge fail him, he isn't even that frail. I've never had an Edward who didn't cap HP, Str, Skl, Spd, Luck and Def, and he often get that Res cap to, due to BEXP. Given training, he is easily the best TB in the game. I mean, you kind of have to be when it's possible to have you running around with 150+ avoid, 50 attack and 105% crit on a weapon with infinite uses and 1-2 range. He's also the most adorably naive little puppy, and I love him for it.

Thief/Assassin/Rogue/Trickster: Matthew absolutely takes it in terms of character, but I think Gaius would get it in terms of both character and ability. Much as I like Matthew, he's pretty terrible in battle (he can handle himself, but others are way better), whereas Gaius has my favourite personality in Awakening and is damned amazing in battle. I also really, *really* love me some Volke/Sothe. Colm's alright, too. Hell, I love thieves in general.

Brigand/Pirate/Berserker: I'm mostly undecided on character for these guys (Dart, Ross and Geese are all cool guys, but nothing spectacular), so I'll go by combat abilities. Dart. A hundred times over, Dart. The only character in FE7 I genuinely look forward to using (they're alright, but not mould-breaking), whereas Dart absolutely and utterly annihilates anything you put him against. Give him a Killer Axe and an A Support with Rebecca, and the game might as well give up.

Mercenary: Ike. Can I say Ike? I'm kidding. It's Gerik. Gerik seems like a really, *really* cool guy (he and Marisa constitute my biggest ship in all of fiction), and he's the best unit in SS when it comes to *slaughtering everything*. 13 Con as a Merc, and 15 as a Hero (I'm not judging if you make him a Ranger, except I totally am), means that no sword in the game weighs him down, and the only worthwhile Axe that does is the Brave Axe, and that's only by one. Of course, his other stats are amazing too; his base stats are basically the same as Innes' despite being 10 levels and a promotion lower. He kills from the get-go, and never, *ever* stops. Second goes to Dieck, and Ogma. Raven's cool, but not quite as awesome as these guys.

Archer: Rolf. I have never been disappointed by Rolf. He's the most adorable little murderer I've ever seen, and his stats are incredible. He's not at all difficult to train in PoR, and once he's at the same level as your other guys, he's good enough to easily get a kill every player phase, and clever spacing gives him a good enemy phase too. Come RD, and I honestly enjoy the challenge of raising him, because, again, it ain't that difficult. Given Strength, Skill and Speed transfers, which he is perfectly capable of getting, he's even better than Shinon at the same level, and you don't need me to explain how good Shinon is. Second is Rebecca, for being an unstoppable murder machine along with Dart. They are the best killers in all of FE7, in my opinion.

Mage: Soren. The most well developed character in the series. Damn straight I'm making that claim, Soren deserves that and more. At the start of PoR, he's a racist, offensive cynic (and yet, despite actually having a reason to be racist, he's somehow less racist than Shinon), but by FE10 he's a calm, collected, respectable master of magic and strategy, who is far, far removed from his former self (if you've not seen his conversation with Almedha, he's an incredibly polite young man in that convo, and with a Laguz, no less). He's also an incredible asset in PoR (best mage in the series barring Levin, his children and, debatably, Asvel), and he's the best Sage in RD. I love him.

Cleric: Probably... not Mist. I'd go with Lissa, simply because I married her in Awakening. She's charmingly playful, and I feel like I could actually marry someone in real life similar to her. Second goes to Mist, for being central to the plot of Tellius, and pretty cool.

Dark Mage: I honestly don't know. They're all awesome. I couldn't choose between Ray, Knoll, Pelleas and Henry.

Troubador: L'Arachel. She's hilariously gung-ho about everything, and she's good in combat when she promotes. I was never a fan of Maribelle or Priscilla, so second goes to Ethlin.

Peg Knight: ... Marcia. It's got to be Marcia. Her food euphemisms are really endearing, and she's an aerial destruction unit in PoR. In RD, given Str/Skl/Spd transfers, which she can get, she's amazing too. I funnel all of my 2-P, and 2-3 EXP to her, and she's invaluable in 2-E. She's always on my endgame team, with her and Nephenee switching Wishblade ownership. Second is Sumia and Tana. They're cool, and Sumia makes a better Lucina than Olivia (That's right. Fight me).

Wyvern Rider: Jill. Far and away the most characterised dragon knight in the series, and she's unstoppable in PoR. In RD, she's *better*. Y'all may praise Haar, but Jill is absolutely outstanding in the DB chapters, and she's the only female DragonLord in the game, and their caps are some of, if not the best non-royal caps in the game. She's a believable character who is easy to empathise with, and she's great at killing things. What else do you need? Second would be Cormag, for being the biggest badass *ever*.

Dancer: Reyson. Simply for being the best dancer unit in the series. As a character, he's also pretty great. I love the revenge thing in PoR, and in RD he's super chill.

Trainee: Ross, I guess, for being the most useable of the three (unless we're counting, like, Donnel or something). He's a great Berserker, and a pretty cool guy anyway.

Manakete: I don't have one. I mean, they're not all that interesting. I guess... Tiki. She's *fiiiiiine* in Awakening, and probably the most intriguing of them in both SD and Awakening.

Laguz: Ranulf. All day. Ranulf is the kittiest, cattiest, manliest kitty-cat man ever. Seriously, though, I really love his 'only sane man' demeanour in relation to the other laguz, and he's a really cool guy in general. In addition, as a unit, he's the best non-royal in both games. Fact. In RD, I managed to cap *every single one of his stats* while only half-arsing using him.

If you'd like me to explain why i always respond using that... firstly because you called yourself it, so i'm reinforcing that idea in your head, secondly because the most similar thing i can think of to this situation is something that occured when Archeum Founders Packs were first released.

During this time where lotsa new members bought Archeum to get alpha access you would find people in Faction chat asking the same questions every 3 minutes. That wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't ""How do i get my founders items?"". So many people thought that you got Founders items in Alpha as soon as you paid for it, even though that makes no sense and it was said numerous times by trion that the items would not be given until release. 

The reason this comes to mind is because Trion has said numerous times that they are monitoring reactions and will make changes based on feedback. However they also know how their game works better than most of the players coming in. This means you see a fluctuation of new players who assume they know what they're talking about and just as much if not more than the developers. You see hundreds of new players spend a few hours in game and then start suggesting game altering ""fixes"". People suggest things as foolish as ""I should be able to attack Easterners on the East continent Safe zones!"" to ""Trion needs to make Resource traders usable, they're broken! Also please boost the reward for trading, i did one pack and only got 7g! I should get at least 20!"". 

The reason this is a problem, is because this people will not stop until they get their way. Are you one of them? Who knows, but you are offended, so i assume you are. However, i will give you a break, here is why Labor pots are ok as they are. 

Labor. Labor is NOT the most important thing in the game. Take a second to let that sink in. A new player can have unlimited labor, but if he does not know what he's doing he will just waste his time trying to level with labor (Labor EXP scales with level and is far more efficient for EXP at later levels due to the raw amount given compared to other tasks you could perform for EXP). An experienced player using f2p status can - with these labor pots - outperform most every patron who is not as experienced. Why? Because the naturally regen'ed labor is not enough to make a single illustrious weapon per day. It wasn't in Alpha, it is even more so not in Beta and release. The naturally regen'ed labor is not enough to turn in an entire merchant ship full of packs, needless to say craft them, in a single day. With Labor pots you get 1,000 labor every 4 hours and this can be used on 4 characters per account. this is 4000 labor every 4 hours. In a day you will most likely only be awake to collect 12,000 of the possible labor if even that (not counting 3rd party program users). 

with 12,000 labor you can make and turn in 100 trade packs. this is approximately 700g if you go from Solis to Ynysterre, but not all of that gold is profit, as it takes money to buy or create the materials. Creating the materials in turn costs even more labor.  With 12,000 labor you can craft maybe 5 or 6 illustrious weapons (With (20k?) carpentry). From that point on you are based entirely on luck for getting a weapon that can be upgraded to Magnificent - as illustrious weapons are the first of the sealed tier of weaponry, their stats are randomized based on the possible outcomes. For example, a staff can be Ocean, Meadow, Lake, and Stone as illustrious, but only Ocean staffs can be turned to Magnificent and so on. This is 12,000 labor used at an ATTEMPT to create a weapon. Meadow staves are worth far less than the materials used, lake are worth more, stone you'll be lucky if you break even, Ocean are worth far more as they're upgradable. Say you get 6 meadow staves, you lose money and your labor is gone. &gt;&gt;&gt;YOUR LABOR IS GONE&lt;&lt;&lt; this means for the rest of the day you can do absolutely nothing that requires labor. Crafters could previously only make 3 illustrious weapons per day tops, now they have more to do. Crafters and farmers now have so much more potential in the game because previously they used labor far faster than they could gain it. 

What do you do as a crafter/farmer when you're out of labor? Your cows die, your plants wilt. Even fishing takes labor. In Alpha you would find people who would just sit around or log off because they ran out of labor and could do nothing, they couldn't open coinpurses, couldn't chop down a tree. You can't farm monsters, everything they give costs labor to unseal or open. With labor being such a limited thing so was the game. 

Now with Release coming closer they have stated that they cannot offer any fix to Workers compensation pot timers being fixed to your account. IF they were able to, this would just make it harder for f2p players, single account users, etc. Farmers and crafters would become very bored, one harvest of potato bundles would use up 400 labor on a 16x16 plot that can fit 16 bundles. these are up every 3 or so hours. You would have 600 to spare per 4 hours doing nothing but 16 potato bundles. A 16x16 of yatas would use somewhere near 2000 labor once per day, this gives you 1000 labor to play with. 

What people argue is p2w about this ( i hear ) is that this gives an unfair advantage to people who buy these pots for real money. As i mentioned this flaw in the system only makes it easy for f2p players to win the game. The best things in the game are not bought for gold unless those who own them are foolish enough to sell them. If you ever see an Epherium piece of gear or greater on the AH, i can guarentee you the first person to notice and buy it will be someone who's not dumping money into the game, as they're impatient and want people to bring things to them. Whereas a 'p2w' player may buy 2,000g worth of in game gold when that is not enough to buy a full set of gear, a dedicated player could already have aquired better gear in the same time.

To make money off of these potions, one has to sell them to other players, to do that, there cannot be everyone wanting to sell them, only one can sell at a time per buyer. This means there will be a small number if any of these 'p2w' players. In alpha there were stacks of 100 worker compensation potions at 1g a piece, no one ever bought them. That - was - 100x 12hourcooldown. Now, a smart f2p player would immediately buy this stack of 100. Why? the only other player selling single stacks of worker compensations was selling for 10g each. The 'p2w' player gets 100g for 1000g worth of pots, and proceeds to buy 2 sunlight archeum crystals.

There are so many scenarios i could explain, but the thing is... it's like trying to explain to a lynch mob why the illiterate slave could not have written his name all over his masters house...

Also, people are upset over the Archeum Boxes. Those are named after the Archeum Founder's Pack. Not the in game item. The chance of obtaining archeum from them is similar to Loyalty Token boxes, however typically lesser grade. Instead of Crystals being the norm, it is dust. In 100 boxes you will most likely gather about 95 sunlight archeum dust. (about 190 g on the AH, and such an absurd amount of real life money). The contents of the box are so much of a loss that it boggles my mind. The real thing they are there for is the chance at enhanced regrade gems i believe, as they give the opportunity for enhanced regrade scrolls (higher chance of success). I believe 1 of those was acquired from 101 total. If you wanted to make money off the AH you would sell costumes, they sold for the most credit to gold ratio in Alpha (an aged economy compared to beta). 

Damn, i shoulda just logged on to beta... time to go make another thread about my adventures in Beta so it can get downvoted and people PM me about how i shouldn't talk about anything but Archeage being P2W and rage against Trion... Take care",1,NaoWhut,True,t3_2fmuir,0,ckb1jr7,0,1427163029,

But still, I feel the argument that ""in game power"" shouldn't be tied to gold is kind of strange. Gold is the main currency in the game, all you get with elder gems are a few specific items from GA, and the ability points/amp points. Item power is naturally tied into gold, because that is the currency of the game, and currency is worthless if you can't use it to buy things.

BoE world drops, runes themselves, spamming crafted gear for good items etc etc. all ways for money to be converted into power. If you remove the ability to change currency into power then currency has no value at all, and the economy just stops being a thing. There are games where you have to collect every item yourself, but those are things like diablo, not mmo's. 

A key part of MMO's is players exchanging goods and services, which requires a currency, which requires people to value that currency, which comes from the ability to use that currency to boost your own power.

Secondly, the idea that power should instead all be bound by a time gated resource, like EG, is imo actually much worse. Games should never gate you purely based off of time. People should get thigns as fast or slow as they want, but the idea there's a set speed you can progress, regardless of time invested/skill, is something I really dislike.

0,,t1_ckav7zp,2,1410023680,,t3_2fn0ad,False,unturned,False,,t5_2z01g,"* Remove / Limit sync

IIRC, there's not much you need to do to get a synced server. With it, you can spawn in an empty world, gear up, and go to a different server. There needs to be some sort of administrative method to get a synced server - either by becoming a ""trusted"" server (open so long / so many consistent players), or a registration system (have to apply for sync). In all cases, if there's under a certain amount of people online, then sync is disabled until more people get on. TF2 servers that run hl2stats/xlr (a stat tracking plugin) usually have some sort of bottom line that disables tracking until more people get on.

Constricting sync is a good way to prevent Maplestrike/Sniper rifle camping. By removing an easy way to ascertain lots of supplies very quickly without any risks, we can make high powered weapons and survival gear more scarce - like it would be in a survival situation. I played in a server that had a guy that was completely geared out that was sitting on top of a hill. Luckily, I was streaming at the time and some dude got on my server and helped take him down. When I got to his body, he had a Mosin with a high powered scope, the best gear possible, 8-10 bonjour clips, like 5-8 heal kits, 10 MREs, and some other stuff. I understand spending a lot of time collecting supplies, but there was no way that he got those items legitimately. If we remove the possibility of gaining supplies without any risks, we can make people work for their gear, making them less likely to just sit on a hill and KOS.

* No item spawning in sync servers

I'm not 100% sure if this already has been implemented, but if it isn't - it's a good idea for the same reasons as above.

* Teams

Like /u/ZimBeans said [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/unturned/comments/2fn0ad/how_can_we_keep_this_game_from_becoming_dayzstyle/ckarltw), teams could be a major help in reducing KOS players.

* Penalty for killing freshspawns

I'm not 100% sure on what the penalty should be, but there needs to be one. Nobody has fun when you spawn and are immediately being shot at with no way to protect yourself or retaliate. I've had problems in the farm spawns, because people like to sit in the hills and snipe people coming out of their spawns. It's beyond unfair and kills the fun. I think if you kill 2 fresh spawns that haven't attacked you, you should get the current magazine completely deleted from your inventory (One ""grace"" player just in case there is an accident). If you kill a certain amount over a set period of time, you get kicked and your items removed. 

This will stop most KOS activity that frustrates me, as well as makes people actually think about their actions. As the game currently stands, there's no reason to not kill everyone. Adding a punishment for killing fresh players would make people more careful about killing players.

* Make guns / ammo more scarce

Do you shoot the guy with the baseball bat and no clothes, or do you save those bullets for real danger? Creating a scarcity of ammo would create a survival situation where you actually have to think about who to kill. This will create a scenario where people are less trigger happy and more conservative with their shots.

* Player's can't see their own karma

People see the skull and go ""Cool! I want that!"" This incentives a bandit mentality. The karma icons are useful to players when they want to find out who they should kill, but provides nothing more than an ego boost to the specific player. If nobody can see their karma, then there is not really a reward in killing absolutely everything. 

I think that a combination of these points, with some tweaking/additions, could make a better player-player dynamic within the game. By removing get-rich-quick avenues and removing incentives for a ""kill everything"" mentality, players will less likely to KOS. It would be ideal for some systems to be put directly in the game, but some features could possibly be added in a server plugins, if the game will support them. Actually, when stuff gets worked out, I plan on making some plugins that make the game a little more balanced.

Although I do agree with you that you play a game to enjoy it, not to bother with the politics behind it sometimes.  
* Lastly, store owners have the power and right to enforce a ""entry fee"" in order to play in a tournament, whether it is buying a pack from a set of your choice or a flat monetary fee. The only options available generally are to pay the entry fee, or to find another store that host tournaments and better players. I do buy my booster boxes online, but I'll buy other stuff at my local card store to support their business and express my thanks for letting us use their store space.  

Best way to approach your problems would be to talk to the shop owner and see if they will reach a compromise, which is quite unlikely since you have said the ""elite gamers"" there collude with him for foil cards or to find another card store that will host tournaments for Weiss Schwarz.

The differences in chemistry are that in HUT your players home country doesn't matter, and you can change their team by a ""change team"" consumable. 
Most special cards in HUT will boost each stat a uniform amount     (+1 all, +2 all, etc.) Hut lives are the main special card and they come out whenever a player does well. Milestone card are similar to legend cards in FUT, but they are also given to players who reach milestones in their career throughout the season. Team of the year cards come out around February each year, and they boost the players stats the most usually. Stanley cup edition cards are given throughout the playoffs, and the other special edition cards (movember, hockey fights cancer, winter classic) are mostly just for looks, because they usually either don't boost a players stats, or they only boost the stats by 1 each.
Also, managers don't exist, coaches give stat boosts to players, making a player your captain gives them a permanent stat boost of +2 all, and there are collection bonuses in this (don't know if these are in fifa tbh). Collection bonuses are given when u collect every player and jersey from one team. These used to give u plenty of coins/pucks but this upcoming year they only give u free gold packs. Also, the glitchy goals in this game seem more ridiculous to me.

1. More like an actual ""Sonic 4"" than the real Sonic 4 was. It feels just like the classic games. However, the level design is the most linear of the three games, and there is a downside to the Tiny Chao Garden: if the game data is reset even once, rings earned in levels no longer go to the Garden, meaning you have to play the mini games over and over again to buy things. There are seven Special Springs across the 12 acts (I'm excluding the final two levels, since they're boss only) which lead you to special stages, and you can collect the Chaos Emeralds with any character to unlock the final boss.

2. This game has a mach-speed feature - once you are going fast enough for long enough, the character will break the sound barrier and run really fast, allowing you to attack enemies without breaking your stride (you're not invulnerable to them though like when boosting in later games). There are seven special rings in each act, and collecting them all will send you to the special stage at the end of the act. Collecting Chaos Emeralds with different characters unlocks different things: Tiny Chao Garden, Boss Time Attack, Sound Test, and Amy Rose (you need to collect all the Emeralds with the initial four characters to unlock her, and collecting them with her doesn't unlock anything). To unlock the final boss, you need to collect all the Chaos Emeralds with Sonic, and simply beat the game with the other three initial characters.

3. This game has a partner system, allowing various combinations, some affecting your character, and all allowing tag-team actions. Having Sonic on your team makes it easier to break into mach-speed like the last game (I think). Tails changes the attack/air action of some characters (Knuckles punches upwards and jumps higher before gliding, for example). Knuckles gives each character more powerful attacks. Amy takes away the natural jump attack of each character (you have to manually attack after jumping) but gives each character a hammer for attacking on the ground). Cream only affects the way Tails flies, but her partner action is to lend Cheese to the player to use to attack enemies. To get Chaos Emeralds, you have to first find all the Chao in the zone (I recommend using the Knuckles + Tails combination), then find the special key in an act of that zone, which unlocks the special stage (it uses up the key), which you have to complete to get the Chaos Emerald. Once you have all seven Emeralds and have beaten the game at least one time, play the final boss as Sonic with a partner (Cream is the best partner for the final boss because of Cheese), and you'll go to the real final boss after you beat it. Oh, and I recommend playing Sonic Battle before playing this game.

I like all three for different reasons. Hopefully my reviews will help you choose which one you like best. :)",4,FireShield95,True,t3_2fjx3k,0,ckaa5sm,0,1427177955,

NOTHING. It was other kids, it was TV, it was every magazine cover. The world is against girls from the very beginning, especially girls who aren't exceptionally beautiful. 

I wish I had more advice to give you. She needs to find something that she can excel at. It will boost her self -worth and help her find confidence in other areas as well. Encourage her to explore new things/skills she can learn. She is bound to discover an innate talent for something eventually. Maybe it's art, maybe it's music, maybe it's html coding! You never know what is going to spark your interest until you try things out. 

I would recommend looking for youth classes in your area. It can also be good for a kid to take part in activities with a new set of kids. I remember when I was young, I had a lot of problems with girls in my elementary school being so mean to me, I didn't feel at all comfortable there. But I took acting classes at a children's theater and I was able to almost start fresh with this set of kids and made life long friends there. 

If shyness is too much of an obstacle for classes, there are some online classes offered to children. I know specifically (forgive me the name of the program is slipping my mind) there is a free online program somewhere designed to teach coding to girls. (This could be doubly helpful because if she is interested and starts developing this SUPER MARKETABLE skill early, even the sky will not be her limit.)

As to the weight issue, there are unfortunately no solutions to taking down the impossible beauty and size standards hurled at girls and woman. We are surrounded and outnumbered. The best thing you can do is reassure her that super models and actresses aren't real people. They don't have real bodies. You can also take a slightly cruel approach and assure her that all of the ""skinny pretty"" girls in her class will be ugly and fat and way past their prime when she is blossoming into her beauty. (Not the best advice but honestly, when I was going through similar self esteem issues as a girl, this was the only thing that my mom said to me that made me feel better.)

Another option is to as a family, seek to better your collective health. Forgive me if I am inferring but it sounds like weight is something you all have or are currently struggling with. Maybe a total overhaul of your collective health and eating habits are in order. You can start making a concentrated effort to cook better - and together as a family. It will bring you closer and your daughter might find a joy in cooking - just another skill she can develop to boost her confidence! Exercising as a family will also do wonders to bring you guys together. 

Family therapy is also an option. I know it doesn't seem at all glamorous but I sincerely believe that every human should be in some kind of therapy. 

I hope you find some of what I have offered helpful. It breaks my heart to hear stories like this one because I know how utterly awful and alone it can be to feel like the ugly kid. But there is hope. It is never too late! (Hell, I'm 24 and have only just learned to truly love my entire body, potbelly and jiggling armfat and all. And you know how I finally got to that point?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The real question is not whether *progressive* taxation is better or worse than flat tax but **what are the effective and marginal tax rates**.In the end it's down to how much tax you pay, not how many rates you have to deal with on your tax return. A 25% flat tax will be more harmful for the economy than a five-rate progressive tax with a top rate of 30%. People tend to forget that.

How you structure tax rates is primarily political but a progressive system is better than a flat system because it allows for smoother transition. If the income tax is very low (and I mean very low) then it's not such a big deal and it can be a flat tax but with current income taxes in OECD countries rarely going below 15% a flat tax is like a fist to the nose when you finally have to pay it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT: Flat tax is a problematic question here in Europe mostly because the progressive taxation in place  and government spending  is so high that it would be impossible to match it with a flat tax which would not increase the tax burden for the lowest earners. Some countries - most notably the new EU countries - have introduced the flat tax. It worked with varied results it succeeded in some , failed in others. It managed somehow mostly because those countries use comparative advantage - the low cost of labour - compared to old EU countries.

For those interested here's a wiki entry on [maximum income tax levels in the EU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rates_of_Europe)  and [countries with flat rate of income tax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_tax#Countries_that_have_flat_tax_systems)

Notice that of the countries I mentioned - Estonia and Latvia have high flat tax of 20+%. Bulgaria, Romania and Slovakia (not included) have low rates of below 15% but they compensate with insane levels of bureaucratic corruption and judicial inefficiency. Most of other countries also have very high social security tax rates - which are often much higher than income tax. For example Estonia has 30% social security taken off first and then the flat 20% tax is applied.

Flat tax is often used as a negative tax for the top earners. It works this way if social security - similarly to America - has a upper cap. I'll give you an example of a tax reform which was proposed in Poland before EU entry. It stipulated a flat 15% tax on personal and corporate income and vat. The problem was that before Poland had three rates 19, 30 and 40%. It also had significant social security totaling 35%. The trick was that social security wasn't collected on earnings above the 40% tax rate. Which effectively meant that the top tax bracket was taxed *lowest* and the most taxed bracket was the middle one. Introducing the flat 15% tax would further boost the non-taxable income after the 40% bracket making it effectively something around 40% and 15% total tax (income tax and social security included). It failed but IIRC similar measures were in place in some of the countries with low flat tax rates.

So there's that....Mind you it's not an argument against flat tax but against what often are the real intentions of those who support it. Context matters and income taxes are not *all* taxes that you pay. It's true more than ever in Europe.

I do feel that this is a really odd thing for the gaming community to collectively burst a blood vessel over, considering the industry is male dominated. I have friends who have done software engineering and the amount of awkward sexual tension they have to deal with makes them uncomfortable fairly frequently. I do not have friends in the gaming press, but I would imagine the experience is not dissimilar for many women that program and design games in studios (particularly large ones) where the gender ratio is skewed pretty heavily towards male employees. Now, given that statistically, a randomly sampled male is going to be straight more often than the other options, you suddenly realise there are comparatively fewer chances for a man to sleep his way to publicity than a woman. When you're male, chances are your boss is male, and his boss is male, and chances are you're all straight. Chances are you also know other members of the gaming industry, who are male, and more likely than not to be straight. So, a woman sleeping with a man for publicity is probably not a massive red flag. Statistically it was bound to be a woman, because of the inherent gender bias within the industry. This is assuming that is how it happened. Completely ignoring the fact that colleagues are frequently intimate because they may not have the social capacities to meet many people outside their immediate vocational area. I feel like this 'scandal' is symptomatic of a subculture that is... actually feeling pretty afraid of women and issues affecting women encroaching on their tried and true games industry, where women have largely historically been at worst objects (looking at you, certain H-games that will not be named), and at best portrayed as vulnerable plot devices to boost the fragile ego's of the largely male playerbase. It feels oddly similar to some of the attitudes that manifest as a result of homophobia, where you have some well-intentioned but misinformed people feeling concerned that homosexuals can marry and that will upset their religious icon, then you have members like the westboro baptist church that picket funerals for dead soldiers with signs saying god hates fags - I feel like that's pretty analogous to the death/rape threats hurled at the woman for her youtube videos. 

Kotaku may be leaning towards click-bait for some of its pieces. But, something can be click-bait and provide constructive and necessary analysis of a small problem before it becomes a big problem.

&gt;Hello everyone,

&gt;The Escapist ran a story about Quinn's harassment in late 2013 with little evidence other than her word. We will always default towards helping out people who are the subject of harassment on the internet. I do not support behavior of that kind and will strive to protect those who are feeling the effects of it. We will signal-boost those incidents because I think it's important to create change, and will only choose not to post such stories if I decide they will do more harm to the situation.

&gt;I continue to ask that you consider whether your actions in crafting a false narrative are helping anything. How will arguing about this situation on this forum make the world a better place? It just doesn't make sense to me why it's so important that this person is tried before a jury of the internet and found guilty of her alleged crimes. The parties directly involved have already resolved any personal issue they had, or I hope they are at least working towards it now. That is all that's important.

&gt;What you think is happening just isn't true. There is no conspiracy. There is no breach in ethics. There is nothing wrong except that a small group of posters on the internet think there is.

&gt;Contrary to your claims, harassment and abuse on the internet are very real things that cause actual harm to people. It's important for you to see how participating in crafting this story contributes to harmful actions and deeds. Please respect all people going forward.

Boosts also aren't a straight ""buy gold"", they also require you to play to benefit from it, and even if Mojang wanted no advantage for people that pay, it still hurts a large portion of players, as TotalBiscuit mentioned: there's a lot of people who like to play games, but don't have the time to grind so instead they are willing to put some money to shorten/skip the grind, and that kind of players are put off by that. Scrolls already gives huge amounts of gold by playing compared to games like Hearthstone, and yet more people play HS because you can just get anytime a few packs for money and reinforce your deck right away, without having to lose several more games against players to afford it.

Maybe they could add a different type of Scrolls pack, that can be bought with shards but it only contains Scrolls from the first 3 sets, or something like that, to still limit the power of real cash. It'd give paying players a way to quickly build a deck that doesn't suck, and it would also provide reliable means of getting multiple copies of certain cards, since with each set released the chances of getting 2nd and 3rd copies of Scrolls greatly diminish. In fact, I think with the 6th set coming out we could get 1500 or 2000 gold 10pack scrolls that only contain cards from sets 1-2-3 or 4-5-6, 1-2-3 available with gold or shards and 4-5-6 with gold only.",2,Mystia,True,t3_2fgnj6,0,ck932ox,0,1427198585,

I don't care that Churchill was racist or loved war (which by themselves are not damning), and I don't really care about Bengal or Iraq. I care that he was a unprincipled, flip-flopping, power-besotted, politically incompetent, quasi-fascistic, war-mongering war-criminal. I'll respond to this..

&gt; It seems odd that you several times admit that Churchill wanted to destroy Hitler ""at all costs"" yet you feel it's necessary (or rather the author does) to include that Churchill once said “one may dislike Hitler’s system and yet admire his patriotic achievement. If our country were defeated, I hope we should find a champion as indomitable to restore our courage and lead us back to our place among the nations"" Churchill even stated he disliked his political and economic system. 

1) I didn't ""feel it necessary"", and neither did Raico very much, considering it was a footnote. I added it primarily for the Mussolini praise.

2) The point, I think, is that Churchill saw war as a game or a sport. You can respect or even like your opponent (at the same time as disagreeing with them), and still want to demolish them in whatever sport you are playing. To an extent, that probably was the case with Churchill regarding Hitler. 

That said, what I didn't quote from Raico was Churchill's social/economic views which were, early on, essentially fascistic..

&gt; Churchill “had already announced his conversion to a collectivist social policy” before his move to the Board of Trade [1908]. His constant theme became “the just precedence” of public over private interests. He took up the fashionable social-engineering clichés of the time, asserting that “Science, physical and political alike, revolts at the disorganisation which glares at us in so many aspects of modern life,” and that “the nation demands the application of drastic corrective and curative processes.” The state was to acquire canals and railroads, develop certain national industries, provide vastly augmented education, introduce the eight-hour work day, levy progressive taxes, and guarantee a national minimum living standard. It is no wonder that Beatrice Webb noted that Winston was “definitely casting in his lot with the constructive state action.”

&gt; Following a visit to Germany, Lloyd George and Churchill were both converted to the Bismarckian model of social insurance schemes. As Churchill told his constituents: “My heart was filled with admiration of the patient genius which had added these social bulwarks to the many glories of the German race.” He set out, in his words, to “thrust a big slice of Bismarckianism over the whole underside of our industrial system.” In 1908, Churchill announced in a speech in Dundee: “I am on the side of those who think that a greater collective sentiment should be introduced into the State and the municipalities. I should like to see the State undertaking new functions.”

&gt; The statist trend met with Churchill’s complete approval. As he added: *I go farther; I should like to see the State embark on various novel and adventurous experiments.... I am very sorry we have not got the railways of this country in our hands. We may do something better with the canals.*

&gt; This grandson of a duke and glorifier of his ancestor, the archcorruptionist Marlborough, was not above pandering to lower-class resentments. Churchill claimed that “the cause of the Liberal Party is the cause of the left-out millions,” while he attacked the Conservatives as “the Party of the rich against the poor, the classes and their dependents against the masses, of the lucky, the wealthy, the happy, and the strong, against the left-out and the shut-out millions of the weak and poor.”

&gt; At this time, Churchill fell under the influence of Beatrice and Sidney Webb, the leaders of the Fabian Society. At one of her famous strategic dinner parties, Beatrice Webb introduced Churchill to a young protégé, William—later Lord—Beveridge. Churchill brought Beveridge into the Board of Trade as his advisor on social questions, thus starting him on his illustrious career. Besides pushing for a variety of social insurance schemes, Churchill created the system of national labor exchanges: he wrote to Prime Minister Asquith of the need to “spread... a sort of Germanized network of state intervention and regulation” over the British labor market. But Churchill entertained much more ambitious goals for the Board of Trade. He proposed a plan whereby *The Board of Trade was to act as the “intelligence department” of the Government, forecasting trade and employment in the regions so that the Government could allocate contracts to the most deserving areas. At the summit... would be a Committee of National Organisation, chaired by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to supervise the economy.*

This is why he praised Mussolini. And the ultimate irony, regarding labour unions..

&gt; Finally, well aware of the electoral potential of organized labor, Churchill became a champion of the labor unions. He was a leading supporter, for instance, of the Trades Disputes Act of 1906. This Act reversed the Taff Vale and other judicial decisions, which had held unions responsible for torts and wrongs committed on their behalf by their agents. The Act outraged the great liberal legal historian and theorist of the rule of law, A. V. Dicey, who charged that it *confers upon a trade union a freedom from civil liability for the commission of even the most heinous wrong by the union or its servants, and in short confers upon every trade union a privilege and protection not possessed by any other person or body of persons, whether corporate or unincorporate, throughout the United Kingdom.... It makes a trade union a privileged body exempted from the ordinary law of the land. No such privileged body has ever before been deliberately created by an English Parliament.*

&gt; [In the early 50s] he directed his leftist Labour Minister, Walter Monckton, to appease the unions at all costs. Churchill’s surrender to the unions, “dictated by sheer political expediency,” set the stage for the quagmire in labor relations that prevailed in Britain for the next two decades.

&gt; It is ironic that the immense power of the British labor unions, the bête noire of Margaret Thatcher, was brought into being with the enthusiastic help of her great hero, Winston Churchill.

Did Churchill change his tune later on? Sure, but ultimately..

&gt; When the Tories returned to power in 1951, “Churchill chose a Government which was the least recognizably Conservative in history.” There was no attempt to roll back the welfare state, and the only industry that was reprivatized was road haulage. Churchill “left the core of its [the Labour government’s] work inviolate.”

In summary..

&gt; Yet, in truth, Churchill never cared a great deal about domestic affairs, even welfarism, except as a means of attaining and keeping office. What he loved was power, and the opportunities power provided to live a life of drama and struggle and endless war. **There is a way of looking at Winston Churchill that is very tempting: that he was a deeply flawed creature, who was summoned at a critical moment to do battle with a uniquely appalling evil, and whose very flaws contributed to a glorious victory—in a way, like Merlin, in C. S. Lewis’s great Christian novel, That Hideous Strength. Such a judgment would, I believe, be superficial. A candid examination of his career, I suggest, yields a different conclusion: that, when all is said and done, Winston Churchill was a Man of Blood and a politico without principle, whose apotheosis serves to corrupt every standard of honesty and morality in politics and history.**

I'll respond to this quickly..

&gt; Are you denying that Hitler stewardship of Germany in the 1930s from an economic wasteland hurt by the Great depression to a larger extent than even the US into the most capable military, economic and industrial forces in the world in such a short space of time was anything but remarkable?

Yes. It's very easy to slash unemployment and get ""growth"" - i.e, a boost in gdp - when you are operating a war/socialist economy. The point is, it diverts valuable, scarce resources from their most desired ends (living standards drop) and, crucially, the boost is *temporary*. The German economy was doomed to failure. The real ""miracle"" was post WWII Germany that rolled back the giant bureaucracy/nationalisations which set the stage for decades of strong, legitmate growth (with the guidance from Austrian School scholars such as [Wilhelm Ropke](http://www.amazon.co.uk/German-Question-LvMI-Wilhelm-R%C3%B6pke-ebook/dp/B005DLQA82/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=undefined&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=wilhelm+ropke+lvmi)).

0,,t1_ck92bka,1,1409849648,,t3_2fgpop,False,wow,False,horde-paladin,t5_2qio8,"First time I ever tried WoW, I felt the same way.  The mechanics of gameplay, combat, and questing is really, really dull compared to many other games that are out there.  Dated, even.  Although some people genuinely enjoy the (very unbalanced) PvP, for me the main appeal is end-game PvE and exploring the world itself.

The mechanics of questing never gets more exciting (collect 12 bear asses, kill 5 kobolds, deliver my mail to the NPC across the zone), there are a few genuinely cool story lines sprinkled throughout the zones.  Reading the actual text and lore can make it more interesting.  Questing is just something you do to get to max level.  A necessary evil (though you can just buy a boost to max level these days, for those inclined).

Although questing is dull, exploring the world itself can be very cool.  Compared to a game like Diablo, there’s just sooooo much more to explore.  So many hidden secrets, Easter Eggs, quirky quest NPCs, etc.  That’s actually the main thing that kept me going the first time I ever leveled – that “explore what’s over them thar hills” aspect.

The point I was hooked was when I started end-game PvE in raids and dungeons.  It’s very rewarding (to me) to work together as a coordinated team to down difficult bosses.  WoW’s got more (and often more polished) end-game PvE content than any other MMORPG I can think of.  It will take a new player a very, very long time to run out of things to do.  Running through old dungeons and raids can be very cool for players that have not seen them before.  And there are A LOT of those old places.  When you see people moaning that they’re bored of the current Raid Tier… keep in mind many of them have been playing for years and years.   That’s YEARS of content before they got to the “I’m bored” phase.

TL;DR - gameplay can be dull while leveling but at least there's a massive world to explore with a lot of stuff to see and do",1,Vutter,True,t3_2fgpop,0,ck92bka,0,1427198936,
0,,t1_ck910yn,3,1409847127,,t3_2ffr46,False,SolForge,False,,t5_2unly,"Solforge is fundamentally different than a game like farmville, the new dungeon lord, or maplestory; just as is hearthstone. So you can't directly compared their models to games like those. They need to be compared to their parallel. They are collectible card games first and foremost and a video game second. Contrast to game like Card City Nights which aims to be a video game first. CCN is built around a single player experience and content was designed with AI encounters in mind, there are no timers, no tournaments, no need to draw in players past the initial acquisition, advertisement is weak point (the games health and profitability is not tied to an active player base), and no need to continue paying a development team past its release. 

Granted some of these are due to the fact that it's an not online game, but not entirely. To explain, as A DTCG it must incorporate several important things. You must be able to collect the cards, the cards must be of varying rarity, content must be updated overtime and new cards added, and players must be able to compare the strength of their decks and thus collection.

For the cards rarity to have meaning the amount of cards you can acquire must be limited in some way, be it in daily rewards or in the amount of money you're willing to spend. Of course since money spent isn't limited by forces within the game, those with enough money to beat the odds will do so. This converts the rarity from a means of adding longevity into a profit margin for players willing to spend as much as necessary. 

This only becomes an issue when this profit margin grows significantly greater than the profit margin the rarity system would have netted them in a cardboard TCG or when the restrictions on daily rewards grow to offer significantly less than what a player would have been able to get.

As it stands normal boosters have a good rarity ratio... However the cardpool never updates to cut out the old cards. I understand this is a calculated business maneuver to incentivize spending, however, the restrictions of solforge create a great enough disparity between what the same money will get you in a cardboard TCG as it is. Consider the inability to order singles from various vendors (CotD is a psychological trick meant to coarse indecisive buyers in the same way that infomercials beckon you to call in the next 10 minutes, as well as lacking any form of competition for the product) or trade (yes I realize tradings in the works) and its implications on acquisition costs. To get the cards you want you -must- spend significantly more on a release, and you -must- continue spend significantly more over the course of a sets release to stay competitive. Yes it is offset to a certain degree with the normal packs, silver, and stockpiling tournament booster; but this falls from a different pitfall. As cards are added to the pool but old ones are no cycled out the effectiveness of stockpiling goes down and down. In the SoS release you could cycle through melting legendaries down into silver and buying packs, opening platinum packs, and repeating for hours and still not have a playset of the new cards. 

This not only forces the disparity for money to collection to widen by a stream, but the disparity for free to play or low spending players to widen by an ocean. A friend could just hand another friend a deck to play with them, they can't here. Even with trading it won't be the same. A friend could throw their dupes to their buddy who can't afford to pay, not here. Just as examples of ways that a low spending or non paying player could be involved in a non-digital medium.

Another problem I see is that people put too much stock in draft. Draft evens things out significantly. Get your dailies for a week, play a draft, and play for hours if you're good enough. Though not all people enjoy draft. It's a painful chore that's only made worse by players who want to afk for a free win and mobile players running down the clock unintentionally. There needs to be an option for players who don't want to draft. 

Even with the tournament system, though there's no real metric to gauge it, I would say solforge comes out only slightly ahead so far as where their lines are drawn as compared to whats acceptable. It'll be nearly impossible to get the new set once 4.0 is released without heavy, heavy, expenditures. And in that way only the whales will be competitive.

Shaman is a very good support, so it may not be worth putting him mid over other heroes. As for Arc, it does little (spammable) AoE damage but that's it. No tower damage, and Zeus really shouldn't stand close to enemy towers in many cases either way. If it's wave clearing it could be considered ""anti push"" instead, like KotL who can clear waves but not push towers. Zeus' wave clearing ability is kinda weak as mentioned.  
  
I mentioned Clinkz and Riki because they do high damage quickly while you are silenced by orchid or smoke. As a squishy hero yourself going into a manfight against them will often mean your demise. Bounty has no silence and so can't fight you without damage items. Regarding fighting ""tanky"" heroes such as WK, Sven, they have a disable and often build BKB or blademail (Sven goes for BKB). Thus you need a hex if you want solo kill potential, but you can still scare bad or underfarmed people away.  
  
Items:  
  
Aghs refresher is about 10k gold and burns your mana once every like 3 minutes. In between these cooldowns, what do you do? Ult is on a 90 sec cooldown and hurts your mana by itself for very little damage increase. The thought behind Euls bottle is to get mana regen (150% regen from euls, 10 int), mobility and cyclone. Tranquils are cheap boots that kinda work well and increase mobility even more. With these items you spend a little more than 4k gold in TOTAL, the price of a single Aghs. Your problem of chasing people is fixed, your solo kill potential goes up, you can run away faster and most importantly your regen gives more sustain so you don't have to go back to base to regen. As a mid hero this means you can roam or farm a lot more, you don't want to waste the solo lane on a hero who will run back to base every once in a while.  
To clarify your combo goes something like Arc Bolt Wrath Arc, EULS, Arc, Bolt, Arc and chase if necessary. Euls is CORE on Zeus, every single piece of this item is good for you. Aghs refresher makes you a walking ult on a cooldown, Euls makes you a proper hero, does so earlier and boosts your farm. Global presence is good, but by the time it took you to collect 10k luxury gold it's probably time to group up as 5 all the time, and by then you might as well have nuked Void or whomever with your combos.  
  
Soul ring: Provides more HP regen, 50% mana regen and the mana active. Works nice with tranquils and/or bottle, is 800 gold which is cheap and increases sustainability. Zeus with good positioning shouldn't be taking much damage, and SR is more for lane sustain than fighting so don't use it all the time. I've never actually built it, but it's good if you have issues having rune control and getting right-click last hits, so you spam spells to farm. I would get SR after Euls, so yes it's to go with tranquils. 
  
As for Ult usage, in a traditional teamfight where many heroes are kinda close and fight eachother, you use Arc Bolt Ult ASAP because it's almost 3 instant spells that all trigger your passive. 11% of current health every time, that makes it 30% HP removal from the passive ALONE. If you bust the ult for runners, you could have done so sooner, done more damage and they'd be dead. Say you nuke a WR down too quick and she retreats early, but you don't have Ult. That means one less kill, but also one less hero in your teamfight. Had she stayed, she'd be nuked with Arc and passive so it's really good to use Ult earlier than later. Some heroes benefit from having nuked the enemy early, such as bloodseeker, axe, necro. Against huskar, bristle or razor it's also better to nuke them earlier, huskar because later on your magic won't do as much damage, and bristle/razor and similar heroes want to stay and fight for long. If you scare them away early they won't clean up your team with stolen damage, stacked quill and warpath, Slark essence shift or Necro aura and ult.

MtG/Hearthstone are actually a lot more fair than the single-drop crates. Since each booster-pack is multiple rolls it greatly increases your odds of getting an item of some value.

I did a lot of Mythic back in the day. This was the only proof of a [then] record setting score some friends and myself set on this map.

I could rewatch the film of it, but I think you'll understand my reluctance to watch a nearly 8 hour film.

So, these are some tips I feel like leaving here based on my experience from Mythic in Halo 3 and ODST. Like darksolgaming said, you can assassinate Hammer Chieftans while they're invincible. You want to wait for them to do the vertical swing from [their] left-to-right and circle around them as they do it on to your left and then get the back attack. They are really easy to deal with this way as long as you pay close attention to the cues of their attacks. In general, running toward them tends to get them to do the right swing while continually backing up will likely make them do a leaping strike.

For the love of god, grab Plasma Pistols and use them with the Pistol on Brutes. The Pistol in general is your friend, it bips Grunts and Jackals just fine. Drones are a pain in the ass but the Chopper can deal with them from a distance, it helps if you're backing up while dealing with them. On foot, the SMG works relatively well on them but they will gang up on you fast. Hunters are best dealt with by the Choppers from range, although if you can safely manage it boosting the Chopper to ram them works well. In later waves driving head-on against enemies can be highly dangerous, especially when Catch is on.

On the note of Catch, watch out for Fuel Rod Grunts (Grunts with Fuel Rods) while Catch is on. I don't know why, but Catch Skull makes them grenade lobbing machines in ODST and they just throw them crazy fast.

Helpful things to do in regards to Choppers is collecting them in the garage like area. EMP them with the Plasma Pistol, hijack it, and park it there for safe-keeping. When Blackeye is on, this also will let you regain your stamina.

I focused on skills that boosted wrath so I could keep chucking hammers, but don't worry about strictly adhering to high torment builds.  You can focus more on exploring your character's abilities at lower difficulties, seeing what you like, and what suits your gear best.  It's a fun time with a character because so many random builds are viable.  

Don't neglect the blacksmith or gambling as a fresh 70 either (but don't do it until you're 70).  Both myself and my brother became T1 - T2 viable by gambling shards collected from leveling/bounties and rolling rare rings and amulets.  Don't dump into a single slot looking for a set or legendary, but instead look at replacing every junk or lower level item with a decent to great rare, then move on to the next slot.  If you're missing lots of CC/CHD on slots, then simply getting middling rares with the right rolls will vault you into T1 territory.  

Lastly, on PS4 add as many D3 players to your friends list as you can.  There's a sticky post of PSN id's at the /r/d3ps4 subreddit.  Get a lot of active players on your friends list, and you'll soon be sending and receiving lots of legendary gifts.  It's nice to come back after a day or two and see there's legendaries in the mailbox.  The other benefit of a big friends list is more frequent Nemesis invasions in your games.

Edit - Best place for loot is rifts.  Gear up quickly with rares for T1 rifting and you'll soon be getting lots of legendaries and lots of shards to gamble.  ",1,4lkjaf,True,t3_2fbbzg,0,ck83w0f,0,1427216699,

This is a big help. Sit down for an hour one day and try to collect some notes/feedback forms/whatever you have and a rough timeline of your hire dates, performance reviews, or whatever.

Set up a meeting with the bossman and show him how much of an asset you are. Refer to your notes and all the positive feedback he himself has given you over the years. 

Then ask for a raise, maybe a bit higher than what is realistic but not too over the top. Hopefully he will meet you in the middle and you'll get close to what you wanted.

Strategic level play is pretty mediocre at the moment while waiting on the rest of the resource revamp (expected some time near the end of the year) and alerts are pretty much the only ""faction level"" element available.

2) By this I assume you mean small level engagements.  A vocal subset of players on most servers called for merges to improve the health of the game recently, and the developers agreed.  Now most servers are very full and there just isn't enough space available during primetime for small fights to happen.  Off-hours can still see some of that but yes on the whole it's difficult to get into a squad v squad fight.

3) Directives are fairly clear.  The rewards are viewable on the directives screen.  The armour textures are for completing the ""class"" directives, the weapon textures for the ""weapon"" directives, and the lumifiber trim for the ""vehicles"" directives.

4) Most weapons have their niche.  Some are complete junk though.  The good thing is that the 1000 cert guns are by no means the best things to have.  Most of the defaults are perfectly competitive.

5) There is a tutorial now, but it doesn't have much useful information for someone that has ever played an FPS before.  The quiz gives you a free alternative weapon, a camo and a boost - and you can pick ""Choose different"" to pick any class to get any one of the available weapons.

Otherwise, yep the game is really tough on new players.  My best suggestion is to search for some of the more helpful YouTube videos targeted at new players.  The Community has collectively put out a ton of really useful resources for those that really want to learn.

Well, it depends. 

There's a few hurdles the developer of this titanic game would need to pass with flying colors, or else the game would blow. 

First and foremost, the writings gotta be good. If it's a 200 hour story that I don't care about because my chair has more personality, the whole project is a waste of everyone's time. 

Second, there's gotta be something to always be working towards. For gameplay, I'm thinking something very customizable. I'm talking about pulling out all the stops regarding perk systems, upgrading gear for yourself and your party, skill trees, collectable items that give boosts (elixirs from Diablo 1, stat tomes in Baldur's Gate, etc). Just make it so that there's always a cool new piece of gear or a level up to get, and people will stay glued. I promise. 

Third, difficulty. This ties in to point #2. Some players will say ""200 hours? I'm gonna min-max the shit out of this!"", and some will say ""200 hours? I ain't got time to smell the roses, I'll just tune down the difficulty."" 
If it gets too easy or too hard, then all the writing in the world can't make a fight with no tension fun. 

I think that if the developers of this monstrous game could really nail these three points, I'd play the shit out of it, buy it 3 times, and tell all my friends. If any of the points was executed poorly, it'd be a forgettable, failure of a game.

That said, I still have a few qualms with battle mode:

* **With &lt;8 players and frantic mode off, it's still too slow.** The standard item selection doesn't really inspire much fun in the average player, but if you find a tournament with frantic mode activated, it multiplies the enjoyment significantly. Problem is finding a tournament with enough players and / or CPU on that allows this.

* **Tracks are too large.** Yes, this one has been said a thousand times, but I'm not specifically referring to the fact that there aren't actual arenas, just maybe that they should cordon off sections of track. The first half of Yoshi Valley works so perfectly in battle mode, but the latter section turns what could work as an intense battle into a bit of a sprawl. If they restricted the playable areas, it would help boost the action.

* **Lack of variety.** Whilst balloon battle has always been a favourite over, say, coin battle/shine runners, the latter did add some much needed variation to the battle formula. Plus, given that the tracks already have coin collecting implemented in standard races, it shouldn't require too much effort to copy over most of the game elements from there.

* **Gamepad players still get an unfair advantage.** Before the 2.0 update, they got the map screen, making locating the enemy much easier than the rest of us. Now this has been fixed, but skilled players can still use the gamepad screen to see what items upcoming players have, allowing them to plan out their next moves accordingly. Of course, asking for a character list on the TV screen with an accompanying item list will surely clutter it up a little too much, so just hide them from the gamepad player altogether. There is no reason for certain players to have access to potentially game changing information that others can't see, no matter how much it may be used.

* **Once you're out, it's dull.** Basically the only thing you can do when you've lost your balloons is dick over existing players. Sure, it still gives you SOMETHING to do, and they didn't just bring you back with little consequence a la Mario Kart Wii, but there's little gained from continuing to play - successful hits don't give you extra points or anything other than perhaps a smug feeling for screwing over any enemies you made. Adding a bit more weight to this phase, even if extra points earned are capped or worth half as much, would help to keep the excitement going.

The fourth point is the one that annoys me most simply because Nintendo put extra effort in to add a feature that does nothing but segregate players further. Hopefully a future update may fix one of the above problems, but unless battle mode specific DLC is added, I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't bother at this point.",6,snazzgasm,True,t3_2f9p9a,0,ck7c4je,0,1427235536,

However ""show matches"" are not playing for high stakes, and therefore teams don't take the maps as seriously as they should if it was for ""show matches"".

 I disguise as his previous disguise (ideally, accomplice 2, who is currently in full public view, across state lines, far away from where we are. Too far to make in a days trip. Getting recorded on camera. If no accomplices 2 is available, a random gentleman working in a shop nearby).

He books it to a safe hiding place, when questioned, he claims to have been trying to find the bathroom and hid when he heard gun fire. 

I book it, using my full boost, out past the cops. ideally, i avoid gun fire for some time. Once my dead ringer is triggered, I move quickly to a nearby hidey-hole and stash the money and hat. I move quickly back to the bank, tossing my blaster on the ground and using it for cloak recharge to make it in time. While invisible I move to where my rag doll from the first feign is, which has by now disappeared. I dive to the ground, and wait. If anyone asks, I say I was feigning death (Internal laughter). His gun really misfired, but I hit the ground to quick to notice.

Once questioning is done, accomplices and I meet by the money. We move it to a new bank, dsing the knife to disguise as ""Rich uncle Robby"" leaving a small fortune behind for his nieces/nephews.

- Horus/Hera/Siegfried/Echidna/Odin/FLHorus is a perfectly fine team, you'll want to replace Hera with Hera-Is for better stats and the color types. Max-skilling echidna when possible will be a big upgrade for your team.

- In regards to damage, you need to make sure that you are also clearing out other orbs that are not part of your 16-20x activations. Each combo after that still significantly boosts your damage, and decreases the likelihood of getting orb-trolled.

- Instead of Jewel runs, Run Zeus if you can, OoH when you can't. You'll want to be collecting all the +eggs you can and ranking up.

- You'll want to level your Izanagi to put into your Horus team later, since he's one of the only effective 1 turn multipliers for the team.

Obvious: Get your Horus Uevo'd to F/L when possible, 20x vs 25x is a significant difference.",3,Pakaroro,True,t3_2f2n5g,0,ck6105c,0,1427259733,

Use a portion of your money to bankroll a few jobs or general villainry. A few hundred thousand bucks has to a fair ways for some less notorious villains right? Essentially hire them as your guard/muscle, with the one major stipulation that you get the killing blow in as many operations as possible. Think old-school dragon ruling a town, except instead of gold and virgins, you're asking for people/animals to kill.

Use these sacrifices over the course of the next few months/years. Eventually you'll have enough intellect to start really gaming the stockmarket at a level to replenish/grow your funds without attracting attention from the law. You'll also be able to refine your hired villains activities to avoid the attention of any major superpower, political or otherwise. I'm sure at this point you'll be hiring more villains, becoming a sort of crime-boss. Still killing, still snowballing power of all sorts.

Once you've built up a secure but mostly unnoticed base of operations, along with a solid power level (I'm thinking around the level that you'd be able to go toe-to-toe with most minor to mid level heroes), start picking off minor villains/villain groups in countries without a major superhero presence. You want the least amount of trouble from superheroes as possible, because once they start teaming up to take you out, the cat's coming out of the bag and things will get really messy really quick. Absorbed longevity means time is no issue, so there's no real reason to rush. Indeed, you don't want to extinguish humanity too quickly.

Once you collect a balanced and varied set of powers from villains, find a set that works best for you and then focus on killing heroes and villains that will stack those powers. IE if you're going to be using teleportation a lot, kill as many teleporters as you can while avoiding as much notice as possible.

The real key to your plans will be to stay under the big league's radar as long as possible, which is why you should take out villains as much as you can. The Xmen or the Avengers aren't going to care as much if a bunch of villains start to disappear.

Once you're comfortable with your power level and feel you can move up to the big leagues, entrench yourself somewhere either close to, or actually in the United States. That's where most of the major players are so that's where your most powerful kills will be. 

After that it's simply a matter of picking off high powered villains and heroes until your cover is blown and it's all-out war, at which point you simply go berserk and kill everything you can. Mass explosions, poisoning water sources, mind-controlled mass suicides while also killing every superpowered being that comes after you.

Once you kill enough people you're going to be functioning at such an unfathomable level of intellect obviously no normal human could imagine in which direction your plans would go. Maybe you gain access to WMDs and take out whole cities at once for massive boosts? Maybe you find a way to simply take out dozens of major powered beings simultaneously?

At rate, as long as you keep quiet and keep killing, eventually you'll be unstoppable.",7,SimplyQuid,True,t3_2f4q3y,0,ck60o2u,0,1427259890,

On your Needs Menu, there is a little button/icon on the left side of each Needs bar. You can hit that button when a particular Need is low and it will automatically queue up actions in your action queue to satisfy that particular need, instead of queuing up all those actions yourself. 

You can make paintings that have Emotions associated with them and hang them in your house and they will affect the mood of your Sims in the same room as the paintings. i.e. you can make Flirty paintings for you bedroom etc. 

The Focused state helps you learn skills faster. 

If a Sim with the Loner trait does make a friend, they are better friends for longer and the Loner Sim actually gets a boost from being around their friends.

You can throw Prestigious Social Events, earn Medals by completing specific tasks during the event and unlock rewards depending on your success. 

There are in game [Achievements](http://simsvip.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/The-Sims-4-Achievements.pdf). 

Different collectables are in the different worlds. 

Jobs have daily tasks that you need to complete to improve your performance and get promoted. If you ignore these tasks regularly, it will be hard to fill your performance bar. 

You can change your Aspiration at any time in the game without losing progress on previous ones. 

Children have their own Aspiration and Skills. 

There is a specific garbage/recycling can that gives you Simoleans every time you throw something away. Not sure what the name is though. 

You can replace broken objects with brand new ones for Simoleans instead of repairing it yourself. ",96,JiveMurloc,True,t3_2f31tb,0,ck604yj,0,1427260137,

Serena almost felt afraid to probe further, but she had come all the way to Kiloude city and she was not about to leave without at least learning something about her Pokemon's potential. After all, the journey to Kiloude city had been excruciatingly difficult, as she had to traverse several uncharted jungles to arrive at her destination because she lacked the elusive Train Ticket that was only available to league champions. Serena decided that she would not let her journey be in vain. Hence, she mustered up her courage and said,

""I can take it. Please, tell me about my Fennekin, Mr IV Judge.""

""Like I said, just call me Judge. As for your Fennekin, this Pokemon's potential is above average overall. Incidentally, I would say that its greatest potential lies in its HP,"" the Judge said.

Serena raised an eyebrow in confusion and asked, ""That actually sounds good. Why did you think I couldn't handle it then?""

""I'm afraid you did not let me finish, Serena. Its Special Attack stat won't even leave a scratch on an opponent. And that Speed stat... Well, it's nothing to brag about, that's for sure,"" the Judge elaborated.

""Oh,"" was all Serena could say. She was visibly disappointed - not at her beloved Fennekin of course, rather, at her chances of winning the tournament. *It won't be easy to win the Pokemon League like this*, she thought.

""Fennekinnnn,"" Fennekin said sadly, upset that it had let its trainer down.

""Don't worry about it, Fennekin. This just means that we'll have to work a little bit harder to win. I believe in you!"" Serena said full of optimism, hoping to cheer her Pokemon up.

Just then, she heard a voice from behind her. ""You'd be better off releasing that Fennekin and breeding a new one. A Fennekin without its special attack is useless. Better yet, don't bother using Fennekin, or Delphox for that matter, at all in tournaments. It's not even in the OU tier!""

""What? Release Fennekin? I would never do that. Pokemon are our friends; just because some weren't born with the best stats does not mean that they should be resigned to no more than mere breeding tools, to be used once and then left in the PC forever!"" Serena said angrily at the boy.

""Whatever you say, miss. I was only trying to help. Now, if you'd excuse me, I need to get my newly hatched Pokemon evaluated,"" the boy replied.

""Don't worry, Fennekin. We'll always be together, regardless of what others may say,"" Serena said to Fennekin.

However, though she had spoken with such conviction and strength, Serena could not help but entertain the possibility that the stranger might have had a point. She'd never give Fennekin up of course, but should she try obtaining statistically stronger Pokemon?

Her deliberations were interrupted when she felt a gentle touch on her shoulder. She turned around and saw the IV Judge.

""Don't worry too much about that guy. His name is Smogon, and all he ever does is try to tell others what Pokemon they should and shouldn't use. You just do what you think is right, and what makes both you and your Fennekin happy, Serena. Stats are important, but they aren't everything,"" he said.

""It's funny hearing that from the IV Judge. Anyway, I should be going now, but thanks not just for evaluating Fennekin, but also for the advice, Mr IV Judge,"" Serena said, feeling better already. 

""Haha. Well, have a safe trip back and good luck in the Pokemon League!"" The Judge said. 

The Pokemon League was an annual tournament held in every region, including Kalos, in which trainers from all over the world could compete to determine which one of them was 'the very best'. Initially, Serena had not even given a second thought at joining the tournament. After all, she wasn't particularly interested in being a Pokemon Master. Instead, her interests were far more focused on a certain hat-wearing, Pikachu-loving boy. Unfortunately, her infatuation for Ash, while blatantly obvious to everyone else, went completely unnoticed by the said boy. All he ever talks about is collecting badges and becoming the Pokemon League Champion. It was obvious that Ash's true love, for now, was Pokemon. Eventually, Serena decided that the only way she was going to get Ash to reciprocate her feelings for him was by being a Pokemon Master herself. And that was why she had left her group of friends, promising to meet up again soon. She wanted to do this on her own, without the help of her friends. But Serena was no fool of course. She knew that it would be difficult, to say the least. She would first have to collect all eight badges in the region before being granted admission into the league, and things would only get harder from there. But she wasn't going to give up so easily. *Don't give up till it's over*. She would never forget those words. The fact that they were uttered by Ash when they first met helped too, of course. 

And so she had journeyed to Kiloude city, hoping to meet the legendary Judge. She thought that it would be useful to learn about Fennekin's strengths and weaknesses, so as to decide which aspects of her Pokemon required more training.

""Alright, Fennekin! You heard the Judge. We'll do this our way! If your Special Attack and Speed aren't too good, we'll just have to find some way to make up for them,"" Serena said. 

""Fennekin!"" The fox Pokemon replied with equal determination. 

*Six months later*

""Fennekin, use Flame Charge now!"" 

""Finish it off with a Dark Pulse, Zoroark!""

The two attacks collided and exploded in a cloud of dust.

""**It looks like this may be it for Serena and Fennekin, folks!**"" The loudspeakers boomed with the commentator's words.

But the dust settled and to everybody's surprise, Fennekin was still standing strong. 

""Fennekin!"" The fox Pokemon cried out energetically, grateful that it did not have a weakness to Dark type moves yet.

""Way to go, Fennekin! Looks like that Eviolite really helped,"" Serena cried. ""Now that our speed is boosted, use Powerup Punch!""

""Zoroark, use Dark Pulse again!"" Calem, Serena's opponent, said.

The battle went on for quite a while, and with each Powerup Punch, Fennekin's attack became stronger and stronger. 

""Now, let's finish this with a Flame Charge,"" said Serena.

""**And Zoroark is unable to battle. Serena wins the match!**"" The stadium roared with applause. Within just a few matches, Serena had unexpectedly earned the adoration of most of the audience. It would seem that almost everyone had begun to root for her. When she first joined the tournament, most people, spectators and competitors alike, had dismissed Serena as either incompetent or weak, as she had brought only one Pokemon, and a non-fully evolved one too. But Serena and Fennekin continued to surprise the crowd battle after battle, eventually facing Calem, another trainer from Vaniville Town, in the semi-finals, and defeating all three of his Pokemon with just Fennekin. 

""Congratulations, Serena,"" Calem said. ""Whoever you face in the finals, I hope you win.""

""Thanks, Calem. I do wonder who won the other match though,"" Serena replied, as they walked towards the scoreboard to find out.

When they arrived, they saw that both competitors in the other semi-finals match had only one Pokemon each remaining: Ash's Pikachu against Smogon's Garchomp. Obviously, Serena was hoping that Ash would win, but the match could go either way. Nonetheless, regardless of who emerges victorious, Serena knew that the finals would be her most difficult battle yet. Facing Smogon would be hard because of his repertoire of Pokemon knowledge and his selective use of only the strongest Pokemon. Indeed, on paper, he was the one most people expected to win the tournament. Ash on the other hand, while lacking the intimidating aura that his current opponent possessed, would also be an equally tough opponent to Serena. She was unsure if, given the opportunity, she would be able to beat him. *What if I win, and he blames me for robbing him of the chance to be a Champion?* *What if he doesn't speak to me again after that?* *Or would he be so impressed that he'll finally like me too?* Serena wondered. In retrospect, she thought that perhaps her plan of winning the Pokemon League in order to gain Ash's attention might not have been as fool-proof out as she had initially thought. Somehow, the possibility of facing Ash in the tournament had not occurred to her at that time. She wondered if it wasn't too late to pull out. But then again, she had already come so far, defeating all the gyms and previous contestants.  *Perhaps it would be better if Smogon wins this round,* she thought, before mentally scolding herself for not supporting her friend. 

**DING!** Serena's train of thought was interrupted as the scoreboard was updated. Slightly nervous, she looked up at the screen and saw the identity of the winner, and her final opponent. It was none other than Ash Ketchum. ""This won't be easy,"" she thought out loud. 

With that, Serena exited the stadium and began making her way towards the hotel in which all the competitors were staying. She had until the next morning before the final round, and she wanted some time alone to think. 

As she was walking towards her room, Serena could not help but roll her eyes when she overheard some of the comments from defeated contestants and their supporters. ""Oh my god, how could a Fennekin possibly win the Pokemon League? Or a Pikachu for that matter! I mean, we're talking about Pikachu, the electric mouse! That's as ludicrous and improbable as oh, I don't know, a Pachirisu winning the World Championships!"" Serena chuckled quietly at those comments.

*Later that night*

Serena sighed as she got up from bed for the umpteenth time that night, still unable to fall soundly asleep. ""Since I'm clearly not getting any sleep tonight, I might as well go for a walk,"" she thought out loud.

As she entered the hotel lobby, she stumbled into a familiar figure.

""A... Ash. I didn't expect to see you here,"" she said, surprised.

""Oh hey Serena! You couldn't sleep too?"" Ash aked.

""Pika pika!"" Pikachu greeted Serena.

""Yeah, I guess you could say so,"" Serena answered.

""Well, I'm just excited that we'll get to battle one another in the finals tomorrow,"" Ash said.

""Um... Ash? Aren't you worried that I might beat you in the finals? I'd be delaying your dream of being a Pokemon Master yet again.""

Ash was shocked to hear that. He looked down dramatically as he always does in such situations, with his fists clenched, a hallmark of his motivational speeches.

""Of course I want to be a Champion and Pokemon Master. But it wouldn't be a victory unless my opponent is as determined to win as I am. Besides, Serena, if you do win tomorrow, I'll be just as happy as well.""

""You will?"" 

""Of course. Whatever makes you happy will make me happy too.""

""Really?"" Serena asked as she felt her heart skip a beat.

""Sure! You are one of my best friends after all, Serena,"" Ash replied. 

*Best friend*. Serena sighed. However, her worries were now assuaged now that she knew that Ash would be happy no matter what happens tomorrow.

""Thanks, Ash. In that case, I'll try my best tomorrow. And good luck to you and Pikachu too!""

""Pikachu!"" Pikachu expressed its gratitude.

""Thanks, Serena. But don't expect us to go down easy,"" Ash replied.

They chatted a little bit more before returning to their rooms, both eagerly awaiting their upcoming battle. Serena was finally able to get a good night's sleep.

*The next day*

**This is it, folks. The winner of this battle will be the new Kalos League Champion. We have Serena from Vaniville town versus Ash Ketchum from Pallet town, all the way in the Kanto region. Who will win?**

**What's this? I've just been informed that Ash has decided to also use only one Pokemon in this battle. This should be interesting!**

""Ash, are you sure about this?"" Serena asked Ash regarding his decision.

But Ash, of course, was not the type who would happily win an uneven match. ""Of course. It's only fair that we both use the same number of Pokemon. Otherwise, I could never call myself a true Pokemon Master if I win,"" Ash replied.

**Now that both trainers are ready, let the battle begin!**

""Go, Fennekin!""

""Pikachu, I choose you!"" Ash said as he performed his signature move of turning his cap around.

""Alright, Fennekin. Let's set up a Light Screen first,"" Serena said.

""Fennekinnnn,"" Fennekin cried as it conjured barriers of light around it.

""Don't worry, Pikachu. Use Quick Attack!""

With that, Pikachu dashed at an incredible speed and slammed into Fennekin, sending the latter flying backwards.

""We won't last long if he keeps that up. Fennekin, burn it with Will-O-Wisp!""

Unfortunately for Serena, Pikachu was too fast and succeeded in avoiding the attack.

""Pika pika!"" The electric mouse said as it began charging a Volt Tackle.

""Fennekin, use Flame Charge!""

The two Pokemon collided in a magnificent display of fire and lightning, leaving both Pokemon visibly weakened.

""Now use Will-O-Wisp again,"" Serena said.

""Pikachu, dodge it!"" Ash cried.

However, Fennekin's Flame Charge had given it just enough of a speed boost to prevent Pikachu from dodging the attack this time. Purple flames engulfed Ash's Pikachu, burning it.

""Pikachu! Hang in there and use Thunderbolt.""

""Pikachuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!"" Pikachu cried as it used what little strength it had left to unleash a devastating Thunderbolt towards Fennekin.

""Oh no, Fennekin, dodge it!"" Serena said, but she knew that it was too late.

The lightning bolt struck Fennekin as its unavailing efforts to avoid the attack failed.

As per usual in such battles, the arena was enveloped in smoke. The audience was on their feet, most of them fearing that the battle was over. However, when the dust settled, the crowd began to cheer when they saw that Fennekin had survived the attack, albeit with only a sliver of health remaining.

**Looks like that Light Screen really made a difference. And now it seems like it might be Pikachu's turn to be in trouble**. The commentator announced as Pikachu continued being hurt from its burn.

""Good work, Fennekin. Now, Powerup Punch and follow it up with a Flame Charge!""

Pikachu was now too weak and slow to avoid the attack, and the Powerup Punch dealt a decent amount of damage on it. Pikachu tried to get up, but the subsequent damage-boosted Flame Charge sent Pikachu flying to the edge of the arena with crosses in its eyes.

**And Pikachu is unable to battle. Serena wins!**

""Nice work, Fennekin. You were great!"" Serena said before looking anxiously at Ash, worried that he might be upset about losing. But true to his word, Ash and Pikachu were both smiling as they ran towards Serena. 

Ash gave Serena a congratulatory hug.

""Congratulations, Serena. That was a great battle. Now that you're champion, would you like to be my partner?"" Ash asked.

""Part... partner?"" Serena asked. Could this finally be it? Did her plan work?

""Yeah, my double battle partner in the Multi Battle Tournament in the Battle Maison next week. Together, we'll be unstoppable!""

*Battle partner?* Serena sighed. *At least it's a start*, she thought. *Besides, I did get a hug from Ash, so it's not all bad. And being Champion is great too.* Serena realised that in fact, things weren't bad at all. As for her romantic endeavours, they were only ten. She knew there'd be plenty of other opportunities for that in the future. She'd be travelling with Ash again after all. She smiled; knowing this was not yet over. No, it was just the beginning. She knew that Ash wasn't going to give up on being a Pokemon Master, and so she wasn't going to give up on Ash either. *Don't give up until it's over, right?* She remembered. 

And with that, Serena proudly looked up and waved at the crowd as they stood up in thunderous applause.

You don't have to buy random packs to make a decent Magic deck. The thing that you have to do with Magic is know which cards you need and then just buy those using the Magic secondary market on TCGPlayer.com. I do not buy boosters and all and only buy singles of commons and uncommons. I can make decks that cost $5 or less and do decently against my friends who do use rares.

With Netrunner, if you want only want one card from a data pack to add to your deck, you still have to pay $15 for the entire thing.

My point isn't to say that one game in necessarily more expensive than another, but that the price you pay is determined by the style you play. If you want a top tier deck, Magic will probably run you more money. If you want to play with casual decks, you can easily make cheap decks in Magic.

I've played Mage Wars once and I own Android: Netrunner. I'm going to also lean towards Netrunner here. Mage Wars is a good game, but it's cumbersome in many ways. First of all, the game just has a lot of tokens to have around. You have to have a big board. You have to carry a giant book of spells. Then you have wooden pieces, etc. Other than the money and a few counters, Netrunner is self-contained with cards. I will admit though that things can be hectic when you have lots of servers. Netrunner plays faster and has a more exciting, bluff-based gameplay. You do things like set traps, collect money, etc. Mage Wars feels less varied and more fixed because you know exactly what is in your deck and so on. Netrunner also has more players which you may want to think about when if you want to find others to play with.",2,AmuseDeath,True,t3_2f3md2,0,ck5qxt3,0,1427264469,

* Base Pledge   -   $100
* Warlord of Galahir (Greenskins) Expansion   -   $25
* Infernal Crypts (Abyssal) Expansion   -   $25
* Resin Counter Upgrade (Injury/Bonepile counters)   -   $10
* Acrylic Counter Upgrade (Rulers/Tokens)   -   $15
* Doom Guard Miniature Pack (They just look so cool!)   -   $30

I may add on the newly reached Stretch Goal for the ""Tyrant of Halpi"" but only when the pledge manager is opened up and if I can afford it at the time (who am I kidding, I probably will) and I'll likely do the same with the Black Fortress tiles and current stretch goal, the Black Fortress campaign should it be reached, which is likely to happen.

So, the reason I pledged for the expansions is that they're relatively inexpensive for the amount of content you get. And it gives you adventures for the minis. The reason I got the resin/acrylic counter add-ons is because I value quality of product and if I can get something alternative to cardboard, I will. I really wanted to get couple of the collected miniature add-ons, but I have far too many minis already. However, I thought the minis in the Doom Guard add-on were unlike anything I currently own.

Regarding the other add-ons, I didn't want to pay more for the same miniature, but in resin. I know I said quality is important to me, but spending up to $115 for resin versions of the heroes and bosses just seemed like way too much. 

Regarding the legendary versions of the hero minis, they look great, but again it's just more minis with no gameplay content. However, if you're into KS exclusive, high quality miniatures cast in resin and are an avid painter, then these are a good bet for you. Otherwise, I have other minis that could represent more experienced versions of the heroes. 

The ""Halls of Dolgarth"" tile set are the same included in the base game, and and unless the current stretch goal is met (which it likely will be) the Black Fortress tiles have no campaign with which to use them, and I have too many tiles from other games already lol 

With the monster ""booster packs"", you already get one or two of each in the base game, and more if you get the expansion. So, $25 for the Warlord of Galahir expansion including 19 minis is a better deal if you were going to simply get the Greenskin booster pack of 9 minis for $15.

As far as the 3D traps, furniture, and doors are concerned: the furniture you get in the base set and for myself, I backed the HeroQuest campaign when it was moved over to Lanzanos, so theoretically speaking, I'll have a bunch of doors and traps to use already. 

And I'm not sure if there are many dungeon-crawling, miniature-owning gamers out there that need more rats and spiders! I sure do not haha

Currently playing a run of X with a team of 4 battlers and 2 HM slaves. Not using exp share and I'm keeping in pace with the gym leaders levels. I literally just go into an area, beat up the trainers, collect the items, move on. I've repelled through the caves and sometimes just run from the more annoying wild encounters.

Many gens it isn't that much of a deal until that level jump from the 8th gym to the E4. 

Gen 4 was the worst. Gym 8 is like level 50 and Cynithia gets to level 70. Spent frickin' 25 hours just jogging near the door of Victory road, hopping up to the center when my team ran out of PP,  to get my team of four to a level that would survive the Champion.

On the face of the hobby it is simply assembling and painting toy soldiers basically. 
The tabletop game is actually best described as chess with dice. Both players take their armies and agree on a limit to make the match fair, and through dice rolls and measurement each player attempts to out maneuver and defeat the other. While chess restricts you with and 8x8 board, this gives you more freedom to play by customising your own force and your own strategies while dice and a certain random element to it, meaning that despite flawless strategy, sometimes you might get unlucky like in life.

coupled with this tabletop game , some of the most enjoyment can come from collecting your force piece by piece , assembling them and painting them in your own distinct design,and using them to battle. 
It can give a sense of pride in what you have built and accomplished as well as a welcome ego boost if you kick a friends ass.

overall it is a fun hobby if you can invest time and money, and it is even more fun if you have a community to enjoy it with, such as the nice folks at /r/warhammer .
also the painting can be quite therapeutic

For example with just the base game you get a predetermined set of cards,  instead of random cards every time like booster packs.  The base game box comes with three or two copies of most cards and one copy of very few. You will get every single unique card in the set but you might not have three copies, which is the max number of each card of the same name you can have.  Because of this you can get all cards you need for Netrunner base game by buying three base games.  There are also $15 expansions, but I think they also give you all the cards in that expansion. 

To be competitive you may need three boxes and expansions but you only need one box to have fun. Each base box is probably $20-30. Each expansion box is $15. For Magic, boosters of 15 cards are $3+ where you may not get what you want and four copies of a  single are often $100+.  A deck can easily be $1000+ for magic.

Water supplier considers dropping mandatory reductions
Riverside Press-Enterprise-10/31/10
By Janet Zimmerman
 
Southern California's water supply improved enough this year that the region's largest wholesaler is considering lifting restrictions through 2012 so local districts won't be subject to penalties for using excess water.
 
The board of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California will get a supply update during its Nov. 9 meeting in Los Angeles. Directors are expected to vote next month on whether to end mandatory 10 percent reductions.
 
Metropolitan's regional water storage is showing ""a significant recovery,"" with about 1.6 million acre-feet expected in storage by the start of next year, 600,000 acre-feet more than last January, according to board documents. One acre-foot of water is enough to supply about two families for a year.
 
That's a turnaround from the start of the year, when the first allocation from the State Water Project was a record low 5 percent. By June it had been increased to 50 percent of what was requested, thanks to late-spring rain and snow.
 
""In Northern California and on the Colorado River, the availability of water has improved,"" Metropolitan spokesman Bob Muir said.
 
Storage of more than 1 million acre-feet puts Metropolitan in a good position to deal with a critically dry year, a staff report says.
 
The district serves almost 19 million people in the region. Its supplies come from the Colorado River and the State Water Project, which ferries water from Northern California reservoirs and through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to Southern California.
 
The district imposed its Stage 2 Water Supply Allocation Plan in July 2009, and voted this spring to continue it through fiscal 2010-2011.
 
Under the plan, water agencies that contract to buy supplies from Metropolitan paid stiff penalties if they exceed their target allocations. The penalties go into a fund to finance conservation programs.
 
Doing away with the restrictions would allow local water districts to buy excess water to replenish their groundwater basins -- an insurance policy against drought, said Jeffrey Kightlinger, Metropolitan's general manager. Those basins were overdrawn during the three previous dry years.
 
Residents should continue to conserve, he said. ""Don't go back to watering your lawn every day. Better yet, get rid of the lawn.#

State panel approves Huntington Beach desalination facility
Orange County Register-10/30/10
By Jaimee Lynn Fletcher
 
Poseidon Resources Inc. is one step away from getting its final approval before starting construction on its $350 million desalination facility.
 
The State Lands Commission on Friday gave Poseidon the green light for the facility at Pacific Coast Highway and Newland Street. The company will now have to take its project before the Coastal Commission for final approvals.
 
The desalination facility would turn out 50 million gallons of fresh water a day, which is expected to account for about 8 percent of the county's water supply and help combat the excessive drought plaguing the county.
 
Company officials say the project would create jobs, generate tax revenue for Huntington Beach and provide $1.9 million in improvements near the desalination facility or along the pipeline route and another $2 million for citywide improvements.
 
Project opponents say the desalination facility would harm sea life and use up too much energy. They also say desalinated water would be too expensive for tax payers.
 
Despite those concerns, city officials approved an environmental report that said there would not be significant impacts on the environment that would require halting the project.
 
Poseidon first gained approvals from the city in 2006 but had to come back after the company tweaked its plans. The desalination facility is planned to be built adjacent to the AES power plant, which has an intake pipe in the ocean it uses to suck in sea water and cool its equipment.
 
The State Water Resource Control Board plans to require AES to reduce its salt water intake by 2020, which means Poseidon will have to operate independently of the power plant. Poseidon would use AES discharge water until the state policy takes effect, company officials said.
 
The new proposal would allow Poseidon to either take discharged seawater from the Huntington Beach Generating Station or the facility would pump its own ocean water using the generating station's pipeline, according to city reports.
 
City Council members in September approved the project with Councilwoman Jill Hardy casting the dissenting vote saying she thought the project was ""full of holes"" and she wanted to further explore the possibilities of desalination.
 
The project is anticipated to go before the Coastal Commission in mid-2011.#

Inland Empire Utilities Agency to power up with waste
Inland Valley Daily Bulletin-10/31/10
By Neil Nisperos
 
The Inland Empire Utilities Agency will begin using a renewable bio-gas fuel cell system to power its water recycling operation in Ontario as part of a goal to use only renewal power sources by 2020.
 
The water agency, which provides water and wastewater services to nearly 1 million local residents, recently signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Encinitas-based UTS BioEnergy to build, operate and maintain a 2.8-megawatt fuel cell system, making it the largest unit of its kind in the world, according to agency officials.
 
The green energy will provide power and thermal energy to IEUA's largest water recycling plant near the 60 Freeway and Archibald Avenue. The agency says costs to build the bio-gas fuel cell system were handled by UTS, though it will pay the bioenergy company for the power produced at a cost of $2 million annually.
 
""Right now, we're buying the power off the grid from Edison for that plant for about $2 million a year,"" said Patrick Sheilds, executive manager of operations. ""So when we get it from the fuel cells, it's about the same cost as it is from the grid, but we're replacing the grid power with clean, renewable power.""
 
IEUA will purchase power generated from the fuel cell plant over the next 20 years and use the heat generated from the process to heat the bio-gas producing anaerobic digesters at the water recycling facility. The fuel cell plant is expected to be operational by 2012.
 
Methane produced from solid waste in the wastewater being treated reacts with a chemical in the fuel cells, creating energy in a battery-like process that leaves no carbon footprint, said Thomas Love, general manager of the agency.
 
That energy then powers the Ontario water recycling plant producing treated water used a parks and golf courses, in addition to helping replenish the Santa Ana River for later water usage.
 
""This project will significantly increase the amount of electricity we need,"" Love said.
 
Sheilds also said the agency is saving money in the long run because renewable costs would be stable as opposed to rising oil energy costs.
 
""Having a fixed price protects you is a hedge against rising prices and uncertainty in the future,"" he said. ""The sun is always there and the bio-gas is always there ... They're renewable.""
 
The plan is part of the agency's overall strategy to go ""gridless"" by 2020. The agency aims to use only renewable energy sources, such as the sun, wind and bio-gas, by then.
 
The water agency already uses the sun to generate 3.5 megawatts of energy, and plans to build a 1-megawatt wind power energy system at its water treatment plant in Rancho Cucamonga next year.#

Water system loan up for vote
Redding Record Searchlight-1-/30/10
By Alayna Shulman
 
The long-awaited Elk Trail water system may be one step closer to moving forward after the Shasta County Board of Supervisors decides Tuesday whether to approve a loan for the project.
 
Properties in the Elk Trail area were annexed to the Jones Valley water district in 2007 after studies showed that about 70 percent of wells there had excessive amounts of iron and manganese, said Public Works Director Pat Minturn.
 
The Jones Valley water system has received more than $6 million of federal and state grant money since then, but another $4 million is needed to get the project moving, Minturn said. Supervisors will decide Tuesday whether to authorize Minturn to sign an agreement with Umpqua Bank for the loan, which Elk Trail residents would pay back over a 30-year period.
 
Minturn said merging with Jones Valley would not only provide healthier drinking water but would also make the area better prepared for fire season.
 
He estimated that wells in Elk Trail currently produce only one or two gallons of water per minute.
 
“That’s just not enough to run a proper household,” Minturn said.
 
Properties could receive 500 gallons per minute if necessary updates are made to the Jones Valley system, he said.
 
Because the area has suffered two major fires since 1999, the project would be especially helpful to Elk Trail residents, he said.
 
“It’s an incidental benefit,” he said. “This will finally give them fire protection. It’ll be a huge improvement.”
 
Minturn said that in polls from 2007 and 2009, more than 80 percent of Elk Trail residents said they favored the project, although it would cost them around $65 a month to repay the loan.
 
At an Oct. 12 public hearing, residents voted on the project once again, and the majority of them were in favor, Minturn said.
 
Still, some residents say their water is fine and they don’t have the money to repay the loan, he said.
 
But Minturn said merging could save residents $200-$300 monthly in fire insurance bills.
 
“If you’re a very high fire risk, there are a limited number of firms even willing to write a policy out there,” he said.
 
Minturn said around 80 percent of the money needed to begin the project would be used to build two new tanks and 13 miles of water lines. The other 20 percent would upgrade pumps, filters and transmission lines, he said.
 
If supervisors decide to move forward with the project Tuesday, Minturn said Public Works will begin advertising for construction bids May 1.
 
The entire Elk Trail area would be graded before the water could reach homes, and Minturn said he expects construction would wrap up in late 2012.#

La Nina system could mean more wildfires and less rainfall
Torrance Daily Breeze-10/30/10
 
The strengthening of a weather system known for bringing drier and warmer winters to Southern California has water and fire officials bracing for shortages and wildfires in the coming months.
 
Since tracking began in 1949, average rainfall during so-called La Ni a years was about 70 percent of normal in the region.
 
But combined with depleted groundwater supplies and reservoirs, and restrictions on water imports from Northern California, it could make for an upcoming dry year, climatologists said.
 
""At best (rainfall) will be 80 percent of normal, but it could be as low as 50percent. That's not much,"" said Bill Patzert, a long-range forecaster at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
 
This La Ni a has been building since spring and has grown increasingly stronger.
 
It is not unusual for a La Ni a pattern to follow El Ni o, the abnormal warming of surface water in the eastern tropical Pacific that can deliver heavy rains in the Southwest. Last year's El Ni o, which brought near-normal amounts of rain and snow, had weather watchers cheering after three years of drought.
 
In La Ni a years, trade winds grow stronger than normal and cold water that normally exists along the coast of South America extends to the equator in the Pacific. The system shifts weather patterns around the globe, bringing less rain along the coasts of North and South America, the equator and the far western Pacific.
 
With La Ni a, the Southwest typically is hotter and drier while the Pacific Northwest gets more rain and flooding. The southern and eastern United States turn hot and the chance of hurricanes in the Atlantic often increases.
 
In 1988, a strong La Ni a caused significant drought across North America. Another in 2008 fueled a ferocious hurricane season that included Hurricane Ike, which hit Texas and killed almost 200 people.
 
However, the unpredictability of La Ni a's impacts has kept some weather experts from worrying.
 
In the past, the pattern has brought everything from critically wet to dry weather, said Michael Anderson, the state's climatologist at the Department of Water Resources in Sacramento.
 
Drought teams and flood responders are on standby, he said.
 
If a ridge builds up over the Pacific, tropical moisture could be routed to the state ""like a fire hose,"" he said. Those storms tend to be warm and bring flooding, but occasionally offshore flows mix with arctic air and bring cold storms. But if the flow blocks storms from hitting California, it ends up a dry year, Anderson said.
 
""We're doing much better than we were last year at this time,"" Anderson said. ""But it's still below average. We're not out of the woods yet.""
 
Anderson said La Ni a will last at least through next spring.
 
""It really creates a lot of uncertainty. Where and how it forms and how the weather patterns revolve around it make a big difference in terms of what we get in water.""#

Making it rain: Scientists hope to boost precipitation in Tahoe
Tahoe Daily Tribune-10/31/10
By Matthew Renda
 
Scientists with the Reno-based Desert Research Institute are giving Mother Nature, a local snow fiends a hand.
 
By inserting chemical compositions into clouds, the scientists try to stimulate precipitation in Lake Tahoe during the winter in the hopes of increasing the snow pack.
 
A heavier snow pack will supply more water during spring run-off and prevent the Truckee River Watershed from drying up in the autumn.
 
The scientific technique — called cloud seeding — is becoming more prevalent as it can spur a 5-10 percent increase in annual precipitation at a targeted area, according to DRI research scientist Arlen Huggins.
 
“Cloud seeding can be extremely beneficial, especially in the drought-stricken west,” Huggins said during a a recent presentation at the University of California, Davis, Tahoe Environmental Research Center at Sierra Nevada College.
 
Huggins is a research scientist with the Desert Research Institute who has studied the evolution of winter storms over mountainous terrain He manages the Cloud Seeding program at DRI, which is designed to augment snowfall in selected mountainous regions of Nevada, California and Colorado.
 
There are two primary branches of cloud seeding. Warm cloud seeding uses salt particles to create larger cloud needed to form rain. Glaciogenic cloud seeding uses chemicals to convert cloud water to ice to instigate snowfall.
 
Glaciogenic cloud seeding is primarily used in the basin, as there are not enough clouds in the summer for warm cloud seeding to be effective.
 
Scientists, use silver iodine particles — silver idodine has a chemical composition similar to ice — in a chemical solution, which is then sprayed across a flame. The silver iodine solution then rises into the cloud, causing the moisture already in the cloud to from into ice crystals.
 
The ice crystals become to heavy for the cloud to carry and they fall to the ground in the form of snow.
 
Huggins is confident the process works as researchers have repeatedly found trace amounts of silver iodine in snow samples collected in target areas.
 
DRI has ground cloud seeding generators on four separate mountain peaks along the West Shore of Lake Tahoe. The clouds generally take 40 minutes from the time they are injected to produce precipitation instigated by the silver iodine solutions. Scientists concentrated their follow-up analyses in the Tahoe Meadows region just east of the Mt. Rose Highway. Researches consistently found traces of silver iodine collected at that location.
 
“The precipitation rate is estimated at one quarter of a millimeter per hour, which is a nominal increase,” Huggins said. “However, if you add that up over time, it becomes a significant amount of water.”
 
Increase in water is not the only benefit.
 
Huggins said Vail Ski Resort has preformed a cloud seeding for the last decade. Also, DRI has been contacted by Heavenly Ski Resort in South Lake Tahoe, which expressed interest in having a cloud seeding generator installed on Echo Peak with the hopes of increasing snow fall at the resort, Huggins said.#

Soquel Creek Water District launches recirculation system rebate program in water-conservation bid
Santa Cruz Sentinel-10/28/10
By Kimberly White
 
In an effort to encourage conservation, the Soquel Creek Water District is offering one-time rebates of $75 to customers who install hot-water recirculation systems in their homes.
 
The board voted unanimously at its Oct. 19 meeting to implement the program, which would apply to roughly 50,000 households in Capitola, La Selva Beach, Aptos, Soquel and Seascape.
 
The recirculation systems cost up to $300 and would save a four-member household approximately $600 over 30 years, according to Ron Duncan, the district's water conservation and customer service field manager. Though the savings are negligible, he said the program is part of a larger conservation issue that affects the entire county.
 
""A recirculation system will save a typical household over 3,000 gallons of water per year, maybe more if the people are diligent,"" he said.
 
The systems deliver hot water quickly so users don't waste water while waiting for it to heat up before, for example, showering.
 
One such system is activated by pushing a button, while another is activated on a timer system. The third type of system, in which cold water is continuously recirculated, is not recommended because it wastes energy, Duncan said.
 
Bob Bosso, who serves as legal counsel for the water district, said his system - which is on a timer that operates about five hours a day - was installed about two years ago. When the system senses water that's starting to cool, he said, it
 
sends that water to the hot water heater and replaces it with water that's already hot.
 
""We love it because you don't run a lot of cold water in the morning ... It saves a lot of water and a lot of frustration waiting for the water to heat up,"" he said.
 
The program is the latest in a string of rebate programs that the district began implementing in the 1990s to create incentives for customers to consume less water.
 
""Water falls free from the sky and we never have to think about it,"" Duncan said. ""Unless you've lived in Africa or India, maybe China, you're not pressed for water issues around here.""
 
However, city and county officials have been looking for ways to increase water supplies in case of a drought, when the amount of available water is projected to fall short by 45 percent.
 
""Santa Cruz County is not going to receive any outside water, so we're on our own,"" Duncan said.
 
The city of Santa Cruz obtains nearly all of its water from surface sources, while the Soquel Creek District obtains its water from groundwater sources.
 
Dried-up creeks and river beds serve as visual reminders of dwindling surface sources, he said, but it's not so evident when the source is underground and invisible.
 
A water basin that dries up eventually could be replenished, but what county and water district officials are especially concerned about is salt water intrusion, which occurs when salt water from the ocean begins seeping into the water basins, which would destroy the aquifer.
 
Duncan said officials are not sure how much water the aquifers now contain, but they discovered that the 4,800 acre feet of water they thought was available actually could be closer to 2,500 acre feet.
 
""We've lowered our water usage 25 percent from the peak pumping that we had back in the '90s,"" even as the population continued to increase, he said. ""How much lower we're going to be able to lower it, we're not sure. It probably depends on how much the customers want to do and what kind of technology comes out.""#

- It takes at least 20 minutes for a resting brain to enter deep sleep.    
- It take about 20 minutes for caffeine to hit your bloodstream after you ingest it.    
- Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors.

The trick, then, is to time the release of caffeine into your bloodstream at the *same time* as when you wake up, so that the caffeine hits while your adenosine levels are low but *before* your brain enters deep sleep.

If you waited until you woke up to drink the coffee, then your brain would have an extra 20 minutes to increase adenosine levels before the caffeine has a chance to block the receptors, and the trick is less effective.

I want to add a few notes about caffeine/adenosine balance, caffeine addiction and withdrawal, and my own thoughts on coffee specifically.

Your brain is tricked by the use of caffeine to block adenosine receptors, but abuse of caffeine for this purpose is harmful. Your brain will figure out what's going on, and respond by making more adenosine receptors. As a result, it will take more caffeine to produce the same effect. This arms race can advance quickly, and is the basis of caffeine addition -- the inability to function normally without substantial doses of caffeine, adequate to block enough adenosine receptors to inhibit drowsiness. Without caffeine, you will have difficulty functioning, since your adenosine uptake is always elevated. And you may have difficulty sleeping, due to the profusion of extra receptors no longer receiving adequate adenosine.

Sudden withdrawal from caffeine after reaching this level produces unpleasant effects, as your brain freaks out from constant high-level adenosine uptake. It's like those first few seconds after you wake up, except that it doesn't stop. Headaches are a common symptom.

Having said all that, I personally feel that coffee -- and caffeine -- are overrated. This is not scientific, only my own suspicions from personal observation and testimony I've collected from a few other people. There's around 5000 chemicals in coffee, and we don't know all the biochemical effects or synergy of a lot of them (maybe most of them). We know a lot about one of them, caffeine, but what about the rest?

Most of us equate coffee with a large dose of caffeine, and that's accurate. And because we know the effects of caffeine, we connect coffee with those effects. But I strongly suspect there's a good deal more than that going on, and the caffeine is getting more credit than it deserves. Here's why.

I used to work all day in a place that had no coffee. (Yes, this was in the U.S., and yes, that is somehow legal.) I had a one-hour commute through very heavy traffic, and would hit a coffee shop right before coming into work. *Most of the time*. Some days, traffic was so bad that I couldn't make it to work on time if I stopped, so I had to skip. On those days, I got something with caffeine from the vending machine. Being the daughter of a scientist, I dutifully researched the actual caffeine content of those drinks, from resources like the one linked from OP's article. I say this to clarify that I *knew* how much caffeine I was getting, because I'd looked it up: I didn't just *think* I did. That knowledge is key to my speculations.

What I noticed after several of those soda-instead-of-coffee days is that even large amounts of high-caffeine soft drink did not provide anywhere near the effect of feeling awake and alert like coffee did, even when I had *less* caffeine from the amount of coffee I'd have over the same period. For whatever, reason, only coffee had the effect I desired.

My suspicion is that some combination of those many other chemicals is what produces the distinctive feeling of wakefulness that we associate with coffee and probably erroneously attribute to caffeine alone.

She still had the hand-eye coordination of a three-year old. 

She had it on the second try. She took her glass, walked to the living room, and plopped herself down on the couch. The TV still babbled to itself. For hours she had been transfixed by the new colors, shapes, images that flashed before her, but now it seemed to have lost its charm.

*Why had he lied?*

This was her sixth or seventh glass of whiskey and she felt like crying. How long had they been living in this dump, this utter garbage heap, while he spun her an entirely separate tale? For years he had told her that he was a high-level sales associate at an insurance firm while he really worked in the rock quarry. She wouldn’t have cared, but why had he lied? What did he stand to gain?  He even used to buy her cheap, fake jewelry, telling her they were diamond, sapphire, gold, whatever he thought she wanted to hear, even though he knew she was scheduled for the implant, that she would regain her sight.

She never even wanted any jewelry. It wasn’t like she could even see it up until now.

Still, she had walked around in that stuff, unknowingly living out Ralph’s lies. And she felt like idiot for buying it, too. What kind of rich couple eats mac and cheese and pasta every night for dinner? How many times had she had her credit cards denied, only to have Ralph explain some backwards, nonsensical reason why this card or that card had been disconnected? How badly had she wanted to believe that she overlooked all the little signs?

And she knew he cheated, had been for years. Now that she had gotten herself nice and drunk, she managed to bypass all those parts of her that maintained the lie – the fiction that Ralph was a good man, a loving husband, the thoughts she would never have permitted herself to think sober. She now believed, deep down, that he used her to collect a disability check every month. Meanwhile, he stuck his dick in anything that would let him, which included half the meth-head-looking white-trash that surrounded them. She could often smell the pussy on him, the perfume, the whiskey and cigarettes on his breath, though she never made a peep.

The tears started to flow now. This time she would make a peep. But she wouldn’t just say something. She would *do* something.

Of course Ralph had tried to explain himself in the days after the surgery, unleashing a torrential downpour of crocodile tears. He said he loved her more than anything else in the world, that he only said all those things because he didn’t think she would love him otherwise. She believed it for a few hours too, until he went out and didn’t come back until four in the morning. She just knew that he was visiting the little tramp just on the other side of the park. She could see the lights on in that place.

Ralph saw her as less than human – somehow invalid because of her lack of sight. He saw her as an easy boost in his paycheck, a bumbling idiot that would believe anything he told her whole-heartedly.

She had been a fool for five long years as she waited for that implant, but now she had it, and he would never make a fool of her again.

His snores still sounded from the back bedroom.

She went to the kitchen and began looking through the utensils, constantly wiping her own tears away. She grabbed a big butcher knife and a spoon, figuring they would do the job as nicely as anything.
She stood over Ralph as he slept, studying him intently with her new flawless vision. He approached him, lowered the knife and spoon to his face, and began scooping.

He let out a scream that was hardly human. He flailed wildly, punching her, but she was unphased. She did her work quickly, intently, determined. She stabbed  his eyeballs, doing her best to wrench them from their sockets. He finally managed to throw her off, where she crashed into the dresser, spilling all the fake jewelry she hated so much. He got up, still screaming, ran into a wall, got up, and stumbled out into the road. 

She pulled herself up, grabbed her already-packed bags, found the car keys and left. He would be on the list for an implant. It would take years, but he would get his vision back. In the meantime he had plenty of thinking to do in the infinite, all-encompassing darkness.

3. Bonesaw

So as having everything at max security would be overly inconvenient there is multiple levels of security. However the basics first, the first step is to build a bank, to make sure everything is extra gleamingly nice and durable the walls and everything are made from artifact tier mithril from the Fantasy Map Game, basically it's just near totally immune to physical and magical effects, however it's primary weakness is very low resistance to divine power. Luckily for us neither Marvel or DC have much divines in the typical fantasy sense with mainly absurdly powerful magic users instead. Cover all the structure to look prettier with marble and wood or whatever. Then put XACTs and SRAs hidden everywhere to block pretty much all reality warping and time distortion effects.

Next is boosting the personnel to be tougher in the case of assaults, this is done by getting Bonesaw to figure out how to implant a decanter of endless potion into them, the potion they give is Guardian Potion+, in addition she also embeds dnd mind blank devices into all of them rendering them immune to mental effects or detection in any form. In addition to that Molly rewrites their minds in advance so they are incapable of giving away secrets or leading others through the protection into the vaults, this will mean needing a version of mind blank that doesn't counter existing effects which is a valid interpretation of it. EDIT: As an additional step every member is run through [the Logan supersoldier program](http://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/2eifhv/you_have_full_access_to_all_the_technology_and/cjzt13j) boosting them even further.

The third step of this indestructible bank is the primary vaults, these make up the vast bulk of the storage and only the top security doesn't go in here. The step is a secret room placed under the Fidelius before the secret is distributed to all of the staff preventing anyone else from finding or accessing the room, in this room there is a vast series of portable holes placed inside each other which contain the vaults, each hole is also placed under the fidelius with less access as it gets deeper for slight increases in security. After construction Molly erases from everyones mind knowledge on who the secret keepers for each of the hundreds of fidelius' are in addition to the whole not being able to give them up thing.

The top level of security is the final vault as it were, this is created by taking the mithril from before covering the whole thing in celestial bronze, in addition nanothorns cover every surface to be able to slice through anything that tries to get past that. XACTs and SRAs from before as well. Then it's transported to the primordial pre-universe time by Molly so it no longer exists within the universe, it's then covered in Death's cloak so it can be unfindable even to abstracts. It's furthermore put under 504 successive Fidelius charms with a different secret keeper for each one, the final Fidelius at the center is with Molly. All the knowledge of the secrets is then erased from everyone but Molly's mind and she erases the knowledge of the secret keepers from her own. As the final protection the bank is in a non-Molly Moon verse, the only hypnosis compatible time travel crystal is stored at the end of the primary vaults and it's a forwards only one.

EDIT: Ultramax security. The collective consciousness of all the staff members is combined and made manifest in the physical form of a vault. This is backed by hypnosis so that they are only aware of how to do this while time is frozen a dozen times over, the vault is then formed and the items are deposited or removed before being allowed to return to consciousness with the items inside the vault. As the form is distributed evenly within them it requires all staff members to work together to be able to access them intact with each missing member containing scattered tiny portions of it. This means that even kidnapping 2 or 3 staff and making them open it won't give more than half a percent of it's contents and will probably ruin it's contents anyway.

For the final level of security the entire bank is put under the Fidelius and a separate front is setup some distance away, only customers can gain access to the real bank and it requires an eternal agreement to bank with them along with stringent protocols. In exchange however mind blank and anti-extortion protections are placed on them to prevent theft of the secret, as part of that a hypnosis backed agreement not to attack the bank in any way is included.

---

So did I go overboard enough for you? Your team of six isn't going to get in within the time limit, I'm not even sure if they could get access to the real bank without getting under the no stealing mind rewrite and given the password time freeze mind blank combo that should be pretty much impossible to counter.

**Sentence boundary disambiguation, and sentence segmentation (each sentence on a new line) – search and replace**

To aid me in reading very long and difficult pieces of text, I sometimes segment the text by sentence boundaries (put each sentence on a new line).

This can be done with a text replacement of “period” “space” with “period” “manual line break”.

i.e. Search for: . Replace: .\n

or 
    
    “period” “^l”.

This is mainly for more difficult material that requires re-reading, as your eyes immediately find the start of the sentence.

Ditto (open-source clipboard manager) can be used to gather multiple clipboard copies, and then you can paste all the text collected in Ditto to a word processor.

(I eventually want to find or make a piece of JavaScript to do this. 

I’ve already seen a couple scripts that do simple word replacements. e.g.  https://github.com/lazerwalker/literally. 

“Replaces occurrences of the word 'literally' with 'figuratively'”.).

(In the ""Google I/O 2013 - Cognitive Science and Design"" talk, the speaker says that experiments show that you can be faster with reading longer lines, but a lot of people prefer, and are more comfortable with reading shorter and more narrow lines: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2exxj4COhU#t=1409.

Sentence segmentation also narrows some rows.).

**Deleting text that that is already understood**

*Immediate Reactions*

Israel itself was devastated. September 7th was declared a day of national mourning, flags flew at half-mast, everything closed down, and Israelis gathered to mourn and read the story. This was unlike anything before for the Israelis, who had endured hijackings and wars within the less than 30 years the nation had existed.

Arab forces began to prepare for retaliation. They expected wrath, absolutely, as Western nations condemned the killings and the Israelis mourned. The usual response by Palestinian groups was to prepare for scripted airstrikes, and operatives left their bases following radio orders in anticipation of the response. Even the Lebanese and Syrian armed forces went on alert. On Friday, September 8, the retaliation came. A dozen jets went deep into Lebanese and Syrian territory and bombed 11 Palestinian bases. They killed over 200 people, undoubtedly some who were civilians as many of the bases were in refugee camps. None of the dead or injured apparently had any connection to Black September: this was blanket retaliation against all groups who had attacked Israel in the past.

&gt;At a press conference that day, IDF Chief of Staff David Elazar was asked whether the air strikes were an Israeli response to Munich.

&gt;“No,” he said. “Can there be a response to what happened in Munich?”

&gt;The strikes, he continued, “were part of the war we are forced to wage against the terrorists so long as they continue to kill Israelis.” When asked whether Black September had been hit, he said: “Black September is part of Fatah. We don’t concern ourselves with whether or not the members of this wing are present in Syria or Lebanon. There are terrorist organizations operating from there and they have declared war on us. We must strike back.”

Some columnists wrote that the airstrikes were the 21 gun salute to the athletes, who had not been given a military funeral.

Then came the raids. The IDF raided bases in south Lebanon, in a mission called ""Turmoil 4"". The Israeli wrath was palpable. 1,350 soldiers, 45 tanks, 133 armored carriers, 4 artillery units, and several planes took part in the raids. Over a period of 42 hours, over 150 tons of bombs were dropped. Villages and towns were searched by the IDF. Still, no connection to the Black September group visible, and the IDF claimed to have killed 60 operatives, and destroyed hundreds of homes. But the Israeli public was not placated by this: they wanted revenge, still.

*Long-term Response: Operation Wrath of God*

What they didn't know was that Golda Meir had authorized a special hit team. They would be tasked with an operation whose name perfectly conveyed the fear they hoped it would strike into any Palestinian terrorist organization. The name of the operation was ""Operation Wrath of God"", also known as ""Operation Bayonet"".

The idea was to scare every Palestinian into fearing retaliation, into looking over their shoulders and thinking of Mossad as almighty and all-knowing, and it certainly had some success to that effect. The operation drastically boosted the reputation of the already-feared Mossad, which had helped (with its intelligence capabilities) engineer attacks in previous wars that helped secure victory far more easily (ie. planting trees as markers, according to some reports, to hit enemy troops during wars as they used the trees for shade).

Operation Wrath of God resulted in the eventual (and I do mean eventual, the operation continued for over a decade by most reports) assassination of multiple operatives and members of the PLO and Black September. Many may have been connected to Munich, but this was not the criteria judged on. No, they went after anyone who was connected to main infrastructure in terrorist organizations. Israel went on a bloody, bloody rampage.

One of the most notable parts of how the world reacted to this, and how it affected media opinion, is Operation Spring of Youth.

Arab nations had already reacted angrily to the operations and how they were progressing. Radio-detonated bombs, letter bombs, etc....everything was used. However, Operation Spring of Youth was another story entirely. Commandos sailed to Beirut on missile boats, led by Lieutenant Colonel Ehud Barak and by Colonel Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, who would later become Israeli Prime Minister. The operation was conducted principally by Sayeret Matkal and other naval commandos, Sayeret Matkal being an elite Israeli unit of which current Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a part. His brother was also in the unit, and was killed in the Entebbe operation. Nine missile boats along with some patrol boats landed south of Beirut, coming ashore in rubber dinghies. They picked up cars left by an advance Mossad team, and split into two detachments.

The first, led by Barak, killed a guard and broke into three flats between two apartments in downtown Beirut. The targets were:

* Muhammad Yusuf al-Najjar (""Abu Yusuf'), head of Fatah's intelligence rum (which ran Black September)

* Kamal Adwan, who headed the PLO's ''Western Sector,"" responsible for PLO activities in Israel and the occupied territories

* Kamal Nassir, the PLO's spokesman

All were killed. Documents were collected, and the only non-target killed was Najjar's wife, who reportedly tried to shield him. The rest of the families were left unharmed. Bar-Zohar writes in his book *Mossad* that a civilian was killed when she opened her door to investigate the commotion and was hit by a burst of gunfire.

The second detail, led by the Colonel, drove to the headquarters of the PDFLP, later to become the DFLP. After a brief skirmish with forces there, they planted a large explosive charge inside, and detonated it before retreating. Dozens of PDFLP men died, along with two Israelis, and one Israeli was wounded. From Benny Morris *Righteous Victims*:

&gt;Two secondary forces attacked the Fatah headquarters for Gaza operations and a Fatah workshop in Beirut's southern Uza'i district. A third independent force, of naval commandos, landed in northern Beirut and blew up a small Fatah explosives plant, and a paratroop unit destroyed the PLO's main garage, just south of Sidon.

The reaction was outrage, among the Arab nations. This operation, carried out on April 9, 1973, was audacious. But the rest of the world paid little attention. Europe was a base for many terrorist operations, and Israel operated there, but they also didn't pay much attention to that. So while Palestinian operatives and weapons flowed freely and European authorities declined to get involved too deeply, they also didn't react too harshly to Israeli operations...at first.

&gt;Abu-Iyad himself said that after Fatah terrorists opened fire on the Jordanian ambassador to Britain in downtown London, “The British authorities, like many of their European counterparts, preferred to avoid complications, taking no great pains to capture the Palestinian commandos.”

Turns out that even terrorists apprehended thanks to Israeli intelligence didn't really get stopped. 204 terrorists were convicted of terror-related felonies in countries outside the Middle East between 1968 and 1975; by late 1975, only three remained behind bars, according to the Israeli foreign ministry.",7,tayaravaknin,True,t3_2ex36d,0,ck3xc3r,0,1427295703,

The article is frustratingly context-free: I have to wonder whether the baseline here is *what the city was owed* vs. *what they expected to collect.*

Summer property taxes are payable ""on time"" between July 1 and Sept 15.  Winter property taxes are payable ""on time"" between the end of December and late February.

So...was the $50m July-December over-collection a result of more people paying their summer taxes on time than anticipated?  (And then fewer were paying them delinquent in the later quarters?  When were these forecasts made?)

Or maybe more people paid last year's summer taxes than anticipated, and then they similarly boosted expectations of winter tax payment?  (And then people didn't pay those in similarly increased rates, from a combination of brutal winter utility bills, wait-and-see attitude about the bankruptcy and new mayor, etc etc?)

Several papers that had once been considered the definitive word on the subject of theoretical FTL travel had been torn up by their respective authors, who were now starting over from scratch based on the new evidence.

At the same time, a cadre of researchers were pouring over the video taken by Samuel, and had forwarded demands to NASA that the *Eir* team dismantle the gravity field generator so they could determine the functions of various items. These demands were flatly refused, since the Dulutewae needed the generator to survive. After one researcher refused to accept this and kept escalating his demands, a NASA engineer arrived at his house with a bag of tools asking if he could take his pacemaker apart to see how it worked, which resulted in his demands being withdrawn.

While all of this had been going on, Mark Wittenburg’s arraignment had taken place, where he was formally charged with public intoxication, assault, attempted kidnapping, and possession of an illegal firearm, all compounded by the insistence of the prosecution that his actions were a premeditated hate crime. His lawyer had entered a plea of not guilty due to diminished capacity due to his alcohol problem, and asked for a pre-trial release so that he could seek treatment.

To the surprise of the prosecution, the judge agreed, accepting Mark’s lawyer’s argument that his violent actions were only due to the over-consumption of alcohol, and ordered that Mark be put into a 60-day treatment program in lieu of detention. The only consideration that the judge gave the prosecution was that Mark was to wear a monitoring device to track his movements.

Not even his own lawyer was surprised when he was notified that Mark had cut the device off and was nowhere to be found.

“Okay, we’re ready to give it a try. Tell everyone to settle down,” warned Kuba, standing next to a cobbled-together relay panel that connected one of the main drive power units into the gravity field generator. “I hope we got the voltage right,” he muttered to Peter.

“You and I both, mate,” he replied. “You three ready in there, Samuel?”

“Aye, and you bloody well better be slow about the power, I don’t want to get any shorter.”

“Here we go, one… two… three…” Slowly ramping up the available power, and everyone standing as far away as safely possible, nothing happened until about a full megawatt of power was applied, and the gravity generator kicked in with an almighty *clunk*.

“Hold it! Hold it!” yelled Samuel. Kuba stopped the power increase. “Getting a partial field, less than a percent of a g, aye, drifting slowly down, okay, up it a bit lad, steady, hold it. Looks stable. Yasuo, Ruxzcon, how does it look for the two of ya?”

“*Hai*, good,” the Japanese responded, the alien echoing his sentiment.

“Okay, bring up it, up, more, okay at two percent, keep going, give it some willie there Kuba, yea, take it you naughty girl,” Samuel called out.

“You do know we’re on a live feed, right, Mr. MacSual?” Amanda chastised him with a voice so cold he felt his ears freeze.

“Yes mum, sorry mum, won’t happen again mum. Kuba, what’s the power level?”

“We’re at 90% and holding,” he replied.

“Getting some thermal loading on the power lines, we need to back this off before we melt the insulation and short things out!” Peter warned.

“Back everything off and shut it down,” order Amanda, and the crew complied, returning the *Jewel* to zero gravity. The passengers, who were initially thrilled with the results, collectively groaned when zero-g returned.

“That only got us to about .2 g,” groused Daniela.

“We’ll need about three or four times that much to survive,” worried Ruxzcon.

“No two ways around it, we need to lay more cable to share the load so they don’t melt, and use all four engine units. The good news is that it’s working! Ruxzcon, can you work with Yasuo to see if you can fix the broken emitters? Maybe if we have those we can boost the available effect. What about it Kuba, think you can make a bigger relay panel?” Amanda challenged him.

“Oh yea! Sure!” he eagerly responded, pleased he could strut his stuff.

“Excellent! Sounds like a plan! And once the bigger units get here, we can swap’em in and get the rest of the ship online!” Amanda enthused.

The team got to work with a vengeance.

While the police searched for Mark, they put a protective detail on Marty Mosely as a precaution, just in case he tried again. Marty complained loudly about this, agreeing in the end, but refused to stop going into work or other social events as needed. The detail was hyper-vigilant in their protection, and scrutinized everyone coming near as a possible threat.

The former threat, however, had no interest in tangling with the lady that had took his gun away and beat him with it, and then tied him up with jumper cables. Instead, he was in one of the city’s lower-end drinking establishment, morosely nursing a beer that his dwindling supply of cash had purchased. Looking up at the TV that was silently playing the news, he almost choked on his cheap beer when they ran more coverage of the *Eir* mission and their current status.

Opening his mouth to ask the bartender to change the channel, he abruptly snapped it closed and looked back down at his glass, gripping it tightly, not wanting to draw attention to himself.

“Need something buddy?” the bartender asked, noticing his sudden action.

Looking up at him, Mark said, “naw, thanks.” Downing the last of his beer, he said, “guess I’ll be on my way,” and shoved himself off the stool. As the bartender watched him leave, wiping down the area where Mark had been, he pulled a cell phone out of his pocket and dialed a number.

“Lousy goddamn town”, Mark muttered to himself, hands in his ratty coat pockets, one of the few things his landlord had kept for him after he threw his stuff out of the apartment. “Can’t get a drink without someone bothering me.” So intent was his self-absorbsion he didn’t notice the car pulling up to the curb next to him.

“Hey!” a voice called, causing him to stop and look around. “You Mark?”

The voice was coming from a weathered face that was peering out from the open window of a beat-up Ford truck, lit by the sickly yellow-hued light from the overhead streetlamp. Deciding that he wanted no part of this, Mark said, “nope, got the wrong guy,” and kept walking.

He heard the door open behind him and someone get out as the man hurried to catch up with him. Clenching one fist in his pocket, he turned around, ready to start punching if the need arose.

The man stopped a few feet away and raised his hands, saying “whoa partner! Just want to have a conversation, maybe buy you some beer.”

Relaxing his hands, Mark asked, “how much beer?”",46,j1xwnbsr,True,t3_2ewv4g,0,ck3oj9p,0,1427299881,

It's an action RPG similar to Wayward Souls. The characters themselves are rolled out via an egg machine, but if you reset until getting a 4*, you're pretty much set even as non-IAP. 

It's possible to solo the entire game with a 4* lancer with a 2* healer (easily rolled with the jewels you'll get for clearing a stage), including hard mode. I've played the game for about a week as non-IAP and cleared right up to the final chapter of normal mode and rolled a total of 2 4*, 4 3*, and a bunch of 2* characters, so it's not like they're super rare either.

The character growth system is a lot like FFX's sphere grid/Path of Exile, where you can collect gems from fallen enemies (just like spheres) and souls (distributable exp). Most of the grid consists of stats improvement like attack +4, defense +3, etc, but there are special nodes where you will unlock secondary active skills (nukes, heals, passive skills, combo increasers) and any dupes you pull from the REM will give rainbow gems that you can use to power up any character with a massive stat boost.

It's completely possible to finish the game without spending a dime, and with the massive amounts of jewels you can get by clearing quests, it makes for an excellent action RPG.

There's also online co-op to clear harder dungeons/raid bosses with a total of 4 players, so it's even got a slight edge on other action RPGs.",4,Vervy,True,t3_2ewp3q,0,ck3nz3f,0,1427300143,

* Your most immediate problem right now is cash flow. Get on the phone with every lead you currently have and offer them a 50% discount on your product for the first year if they sign up in the next 14 days. Say you're running a promotion. You need a longer runway, so don't worry about the discount for now. You'll make up for it later if you make it and hopefully some volume will help make up for it. Collect the money up front.
* Change your homepage content. It doesn't need to be perfect, but it needs to be done tomorrow. As DavidARoop mentioned, you need to have a video demo of your product. You can use http://camstudio.org/ or an alternative (http://www.shoutmeloud.com/camtasia-alternatives-free-windwows-mac.html) to create the video, You also need screenshots of your product.
* The sales copy needs to change as well. It should be immediately apparent to a visitor what your product does. Place the screenshots and a brief description above the fold. Follow up with both benefits and features. You're going to need more than the 3 you have currently.
* If you have any case studies or white papers with actual stats for how your product has helped a dealer, put it on the site. Bonus points if you have video testimonial, but that's not the highest priority right now.
* Add a pricing page. Include your normal price and then have it discounted 25%, for example: ~~$199~~ $149 for a limited time. You might not always need a pricing page, but for now, it'll do 4 things: It'll shorten your sales cycle, it'll weed out non-customers so you can concentrate on those with higher commercial intention, it'll let those you offered the 50% deal to on the phone know that they're getting a special deal, and it'll give new visitors a higher incentive to buy.
* Forget about social media and online advertising for right now, they're a longer play, not always the best fit for B2B customer acquisition, and they cost more money than you have right now. The exception to this might be LinkedIn, which could be used for you to help build a list (but don't buy ads on LinkedIn).
* Build a list, but not just any list. Because you need an abbreviated sales process right now, you need a focused list. Forget the bigger dealers for right now, it'll take too long to go through the sales cycle with them. Concentrate on smaller dealers where you can talk with a decision maker or owner who can decide to buy on their own authority. Build the list through LinkedIn, Google, and the Yellow Pages (online). You can use LinkedIn to correlate the size of the dealership by the number of employees it has. List building is tough, though, so take the person who is probably going to be the worst at phone sales and have them build the list for others to call.
* I'm assuming you already have a working product (if not, most of this advice is moot). For now, until you get above water, stop development except for critical bugs and get as many people as you can on the phones. If you don't already have it, put together a basic sales script. Get together at the end of each day, discuss what worked, what didn't, and make changes accordingly. 
* Don't leave the impetus of follow-up on the customer. Say you'll contact them in a few days and then actually do it. So many sales are lost on follow-through.
* Consider additional services that you could offer as a cross-promotion or supplementary service. You have 3 developers, you understand the auto industry, and I think there are some possibilities to play with there with custom development to help carry you over. However, only offer these as an opportunity presents itself and if it's clear the initial product isn't a match, otherwise you'll dilute your sales pitch. If you do make a sale, though, you can offer an upsell.
* Cut out any non-essential expenses.
* I normally don't recommend going into debt and so I would only do this as a last resort after your sales push if you need it, but if you have a boost of purchases, you may be able to get a line of credit or a bridge loan from a bank to see you through for a month or two. Don't go crazy with this, though, because debt is serious.
* This is up to you, but I would tell everyone in the company where we're at as their livelihood is also on the line. At the same time, this is the time you need to lead the most. Show you have a plan, win, lose, or draw, and then be the one leading the charge.

Some of what I said above shouldn't or wouldn't apply for building a business long-term, but it's appropriate for an emergency situation like this. If you make it, there is a ton that you'll need to look at long-term, but a key focus should be tightening your sales cycle. You might also want to consider other verticals that could use some or all of your product: schools, day cares, churches (the nurseries), hair salons, pet groomers, food delivery, bakeries, etc. But that's for another day. For now, just concentrate on getting through the next month.

Above everything else, don't despair. This isn't the end and there will be other opportunities, whether it's with this venture or not. You've taken a huge chance to chase your dream and that's something a lot of people don't even have the courage to attempt. It's been a tough road, but hang in there.

I think Dexter has been an incredible asset to CLG, a team so used to playing with a non-jungling jungler. When he joined the team the improvement was immediate and noticeable and CLG shaped up to be one of the top teams earlier in the split. Dexter does have some weaknesses though. He often will go too deep into the jungle without the support of his solo lanes and will play over aggressively and die early. If this happens, its really hard for CLG to come back, because he will continue to try and force plays from behind and it snowballs against them. Conversely, when these aggressive plays go well, he can largely snowball the game himself from the advantage. I personally think the stuff about his dedication and drama about him going to Alex Penns going away party is utter bullshit and won't address it further. Given the boost in their performance and Dexters decisiveness early game being good for shotcall problem laden CLG, I think it would be a mistake to replace Dexter, and there is not a lot of jungle talent floating around anymore either. At least with Doublelift they would have a ADC lined up in Gosu.


As a former disciple of Chauster myself, I really wanted Link to live up to his potential that everyone has talked about since S2. He was always described as being intelligent and mechanically very good, yet consistently underwhelming in NA, a region not particularly known for its mid lane talent pool. The stark contrast between Link and Dexters playstyle is a problem when jungle and mid synergy is going to become all-important with the rebirth of assassins viability.  Aside from outlier outstanding performances, Link in general plays very passively in lane and never pressures. Part of the reason why Dexters aggressive early game plays fail is because Link never reacts to help Dexter, by either leaving the lane to skirmish or even pressuring/pushing up his lane so the enemy mid laner can't go help. This also limits Dexters options as a jungler immensely. Consider this (very probable) in game scenario. CLG is playing vs &lt;insert whatever team here&gt;. The most likely scenario with how the game is right now is standard laning, with 2 hypertanks slapping each other and scaling with TP up top lane, Lee/Elise/Evelynn/Rengar/Nunu in the jungle, either waveclear mids or assassins (depending on the player) and a hypercarry bot lane and either an engage or disengage support. For the sake of the hypothetical lets say Dexter is on Lee Sin, Link is on Ziggs, and the enemy 2v2 they face is Evelynn Oriana. Dexter really has no options to gank mid that much in the current meta due to most mid laners being super safe long range wave clear. So there is no kill potential on mid lane which rules out one option. Dexter also can't really impact the game from top either. There is 0 snowball potential in a tank vs tank matchup, espcially with TP or in a way to make it impactful (the typical exception being a splitpush Nidalee pick). So now he is either left with the option of counter jungling Evelynn and either fighting her/placing deep wards, or he can gank bottom lane. However, invading without Link pushing up and either following or keeping Ori there is risky and allows Dexter to be easily collapsed on, which leaves this option out. This further enforces CLGs one-dimensional playstyle of focusing on DL, and is also fairly predictable. However, if Link was aggressive and kept Oriana mid, then Dexter on Lee can kill Evelynn, or he can roam and win the 2v2. This also open up a lot of opportunities for dragon if a pick is made. I don't know if Link just has consistency/performance issues or if he really never had the potential that people thought, but his play has been overall underwhelming on CLG and has proved he does not show up in pressure situations. It's scary to possibly lose him as he is one of the shotcallers, but I think Aphro can take over that role for the most part and it would work a lot better for CLG. They could also try to pick up some EU midlane talent like Nukeduck or something.


Seraph also hasn't really performed ever since arriving on CLG. TO be completely fair to him, when he first joined CLG he was a wreck of nerves and had every right to be. And he has taken great strides in controlling them and becoming a much more collected player. His teamplay has also improved (keeping in mind his only real experience was solo queue previously, one competitive game on Shield doesn't count). However, Seraph has also said himself in a tweet that he feels his mechanics are not what they used to be (hopefully this is an easy fix that can be worked out by grinding solo queue). He also has never really looked especially comfortable on any champion CLG has him play outside of Shyvana and maybe Renekton. THe argument can be made that he will be a more potent top laner with the return of top lane Nidalee, but so far has not shown any special or outstanding performances, has had quite a few weak performances, and is prone to have performance anxiety issues. He has only had 1 split to develop with CLG so far, and there really isn't a whole lot of know top lane talent around for CLG to pick from, so it's a pretty tough call whether or not Seraph should be replaced or not. I'm 50-50

tl;dr CLG should either wait for the sports psychologist to come in, see what he can do and then roster swap, or roster swap now. In terms of who, keep DL Aphro and Dexter, boot Link, and I can't tell with Seraph (and these are all based on how the players are performing as of now. Doesn't mean I don't hope Link will prove me wrong and start beasting everyone)",3,MyTeamSux,True,t3_2evcbj,0,ck3d9eb,0,1427305270,

In particular, they mention that it's a good thing because being far ahead in Mario Kart isn't fun, because you can't do things such as use items. Well, yeah, that's true, but if the game was better designed, it wouldn't be.

For an example of a contrasting case, take [Crash Team Racing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Team_Racing), which was essentially Mario Kart 64's opposite number on the the original Playstation. In CTR, while in first place you exclusively receive items that are useful to a player in first place; almost entirely droppable TNT and beakers, which explode when hit by a player, with occasional defensive items. As you get further back into the pack, you get more and more speed boosts, bowling bombs and missles (analogous to green and red shells, respectively), Aku/Uka masks (very much like stars), and, if you're close to the back, the two massive-catchup items: Lightning Balls and the N.Tropy Clock.

There is a critical difference in how items work in CTR, however: being ""Juiced-up"". Similar to the coin mechanic found in some mario karts, there were 'Wumpa Fruit', which can be collected off the ground or some (fairly rare) crates, up to a maximum of 10. Unlike coins, having a few coins does nothing for you. You got no benefit unless you have a full set of 10, in which case you are Juiced-Up and get a passive speed boost and an upgrade to your items. This has two effects: Getting hit with a weak attack is more impactful, since getting hurt (including most crashes) takes away at least one fruit. And there is still something that needs to be done even if you are well ahead of the pack. If you are trailing significantly, moreover, it becomes easier to get Juiced Up, since the fruit crates, while rare, regenerate quickly enough that if you can't see the opponent slightly ahead of you, it will have regrown for certain.

Also, the item differences bear some specific mentioning.

Bowling bombs and Missiles: These are fairly straight ports of green and red shells, including the capability of acquiring three at once. If juiced, the bombs explode in a bigger radius, and the missiles move much faster, gaining the ability to home in even around sharp corners.

Crates: TNT, the ordinary version, gives the player it hits a few seconds to avoid the explosion, which requires hopping their cart repeatedly and losing all their speed. The upgrade is Nitro, which explodes immediately. 

Beakers: These cause a very small explosion in the base form, though they can be aimed and shot cleverly. The juiced version causes no explosion, but removes 1 fruit and drastically limits the top speed of the player hit for several seconds.

Shields: The basic shield, which is common and can be acquired even while toward the front, protects from one hit but fades over time. It's upgrade does not fade. The advanced shield is Aku Aku/Uka Uka (depends on character), which acts like a star, granting you continuous bonus acceleration and invulnerability, as well as dealing large damage to other players if you pass through them and increasing your hitbox for this purpose only; this shows up commonly, if you're not near the front of the line.

Energy Ball: This is this game's Blue Shell equivalent, and it serves largely the same purpose while being much less frustrating. It deals less damage and moves less quickly, and shows up on the game minimap as if it was a racer; good players can see it coming and prepare, such as by dropping an explosive behind them to stop it. When juiced, it moves quickly and hits every single opponent in front of you; when not, it's slower and easily avoided for everyone except the first player. Additionally, even while it's juiced, a player moving very quickly can outrun it for several seconds before it catches up. This powerup *can* show up for anyone who isn't in first, but is much more likely as you are further back in the race.

N. Tropy Clock: This is the serious catchup mechanic of CTR, extremely uncommon unless you're extremely far behind. It hits everyone instantly, stopping them and blurring their screens for several seconds, during which their controls are less responsive and their top speed is reduced. The juiced version slows them down for slightly longer.

In general, the non-juiced versions of items are fairly weak, and could be shrugged off, except that they cause you to lose juice. But most importantly, they deal with all the problems in Mario Kart, *without* imposing capricious penalties for racing well. Where Mario Kart has catchup mechanics so strong that it's beneficial to be bad, CTR smoothed it out to create a good balance where clever timing could let you escape attacks or make them more effective, even when you were  far from the lead.",9,VorpalAuroch,True,t3_2eu5da,0,ck3cg4n,0,1427305652,

While its nice to go and bash a bunch of baddies in an instance or collect a dozen pieces for a backpiece it becomes a passing fancy. The content coming out now has 2 major flaws: firstly, no repeatability. Hardcore dungeons and fractals are a great way to do this, theynwould have to both be rewarding and be so hard that a group of players really have to get into a rhythm with eachother in order to FEEL like they had to evolve as a team to accomplish the task. The second major flaw is that people want to feel important in a battle. The reason wvw is so lackluster is because you currently just run around facerolling a few champions until finally you run into an enemy zerg and either you steamroll them or they steamroll you. In wvw you are not a skillful player. You are a number in a zerg there to do nothing more than boost overall dps. Its hard for people to take pride in their servers accomplishments in wvw when the deciding factor of who wins is who has the most players.

Poppy Flower by Coach: LOVED this one. It's got such a fresh, lovely, mouth watering scent. I don't wear it anymore but use it to  spritz around my house and in my closets for a little boost.

Viva La Juicy by Juicy Couture: I'm not a big fan of Juicy Couture, so I was really surprised at how much I like this. It's sexy and full-bodied but fades to something really subtle and lovely. It's my day-wear perfume currently.

Playing Carcassonne with a three-tile hand theoretically makes the game ""more strategic,"" except that what it actually does is greatly reduce the chance that someone will be forced to play an unfavorable tile, which reduces the rate that new opportunities open up on the board and makes certain tiles (e.g. monasteries) much too powerful.  And of course we all know what happens when you put money in the middle of the Monopoly board so that it can be collected when someone lands on Free Parking.

But there are a lot of games on the market today that are, for whatever reason, less finished.  This can be good (elaborately expandable games that get more interesting over time, like Sentinels of the Multiverse), and it can be bad (half-baked games whose buyers have to figure out how to finish baking them, like Myth).

CCGs are a great field for this kind of thing, since CCGs are unfinished by design.  Just about any CCG can be played with the Highlander variant, in which your deck can contain only one copy of any card.  One of the things that gets lost with the LCG model is booster drafts, which are fun enough that entire games have been designed around drafting.  The Commander variant of Magic got popular enough that it became an officially supported format of its own, with all the sucking-out-the-fun that entails. 

My favorite variant, which I've used on many games:  add a time limit.  It's possible to play a five-player game of **Princes of Florence** in 25 minutes.  **Tikal** is a lot more fun if you only get as many of your 10 action points as you can spend in 75 seconds.

The SLS is going to be a huge drain on their resources and they know it. They didn't decide they wanted to build it, Congress passed a law that makes them do it, and Congress was intimately involved in the design of it. 

One of the requirements of the design was that they have an early version of the SLS that launches in ~2017 and that it later evolve to a larger payload at a later date. 

Thus they are flying it once in 2018 (they've slipped the deadline slightly) and then they arent' doing anything with it for 3 years at the very least. 

So why this early deadline and then a big gap?

Because if you give them a decade and lots of money, they can do a clean sheet design. They can make something completely new and figure out the best way to go about it. 

Congress didn't want that. Instead, congress wanted to keep all of the infrastructure from the space shuttle in place. So by saying ""make one soon"" they essentially forced them to make a shuttle-derived launch vehicle that uses the same source for the fuel tank, the engines, the solid rocket boosters, etc., and thus all of that pork stayed in place. 

NASA has been forced to make this thing, and even the NASA director has suggested openly that it should be cancelled. And a former NASA director has called the current strategy a fraud:

&gt;Tom Young, a former director of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center and retired Lockheed Martin executive, who said NASA lacks an executable exploration strategy.

&gt;Unless the council said as much, he said, “I really think collectively we are perpetuating a fraud.”

&gt;He's worried NASA is on a path to spend perhaps $160 billion over the next two decades but end up no closer to Mars.

The biggest problem with SLS is that it's prohibitely expensive and does absolutely nothing to bring down costs. Meanwhile at SpaceX they are drastically cutting the costs down and that's before they've done anything with reusability. If in ten years they are reusing rockets, they will have reduced the price to orbit so far that the SLS won't be just a white elephant, it'll be a dinosaur.

95 prayer for turm/ss. fastest way is frost bones, most cost efficient but long is infernal ashes (i'm doing it this way, pain in the ass but will be worth it). World 31 has open guilded altars you can use.  This is pretty essential for any bossing but will cost you a pretty penny. 92 is soul split which is enough to do most bosses, but 95 for turmoil is incredibly important for the high level bosses.  You'll also need to do the quest Temple at Sennisten to use curses, so look it up and its quest requirements so you can use them.  

96 summoning for pack yaks. 67 for War tortoise.  Obviously yak is preferred but you can occasionally get by with war tortoise.  if you're looking for a team, yak will almost always be required.

96 herb for ovls (you can use boosts to get there, 94 for god banner, 92 for stews, which is a lot of luck). 85 for super antifires.  85 is enough for QBD, which is 5m+/hr if you're decent at it, 7m+/hr once you get good.

For stats, get your levels to 75+ and get t70 gear minimum to be efficient.  Godsword/chaotics for melee, hand cannon/royal crossbow/zaryte bow/dual chaotic crossbows for range, staff of light/polypore/armadyl battlestaff/chaotic staff for mage. Chaotics require 80+ dung to get enough tokens to buy.  Also, mage/range are the current preferred styles for bossing, as most bosses are weak to them.  Slayer is a good way to get your stats up, and will provide some additional cash along the way.

Gear: GWD armor will be okay for beginner bosses like GWD/QBD, but once you get a bit more into it you'll want to upgrade to the highest gear you can.  Nex (t80)/Ports (t85) are next up.

As for what to do with your money, its up to you to decide.  Everyone has an opinion on whats best to get first, so look up the skills and decide.  Personally, would say prayer and herb first, then summoning, since you'll need to collect charms to be able to train summoning, which you will get by doing slayer.

I don't know many of last year's threads you read, but I'm going to assume you've read them all.

And in the case that you've read every previous post you know that I wholeheartedly agree that it's difficult to see any real ""statistical"" value to the concept. Some have claimed it's helped them gaining ranks, but the author most certainly never experienced any such kind of boost himself. A couple of times last year the opposite seemed to have som kind of correlation in fact.

So why does the concept live on?

1. It's fun to write.

2. The overwhelming majority of the response received is positive.

I agree that tons of other kinds of analysis based of the same idea may be done. And they would probably make this much more of a tactical and usefull tool.

But as this is done by a single individual, in his spare time, with no statistical education or ability to program anything that can make him throw away his Excel sheet and the time spent collecting the data manually, it is in its current form a good balance between fun to write, and interesting enough that I would read it myself.

And it will probably continue as long as it is exactly that.

From an author's perspective I actually like to look at it as more of a story about people and their choices told for entertainment purposes than anything else. I like the fun facts, they're my favourite part both to write and find.

So let me just quote the one sentence I disagree with you on ""There's good insight to have here but this blog isn't doing enough work to bring it out.""

This blog is doing pretty much what the author wants it to do for the enjoyment it gives him and the time it takes to put it together. And your suggested alterations would probably change that up a bit, so I'll refrain from executing them.

Thanks again for your constructive criticism though. It's what makes blogs like this one better in the longer run.

* Game Booster: boost games to give you more fun
* Android sensor box: show you all available sensors on your Android

One of another big feature of the app is that it offers users an easy access to check the performance status and system information of their smart phone, including some facts such as ROM, RAM status, battery percent, CPU speed, temperature of phone and other information.

  1.  Yes people can use the exo movement mechanics to get away but you can use them to chase after them.
  1. Also in regards to the abilities like stim, shield, and cloak some one using them will be an annoyance more than a big advantage. By this i mean it will be annoying when some sticks up a shield to block your bullets or it takes an extra bullet or two to kill someone but you can still kill them with out much extra effort. 
  1.  ***On the other hand is i feel the movement will make the game more about who is the better bunny hopper and not the better shooter.*** It will end up being a combination of the two which is just who can play the game better. You might be able to jump out of the way and boost dodge like a pro but if you can't aim well then 
you will die. Same goes if you can shoot well but can't dodge or jump well you will get out maneuvered by the more skilled jumper. 

1. **Camping:**
  1. People will always camp and there will be the people that cloak and sit in corners with stealth perks and a silencer. Now with the added movement/exo abilities you can get boost dodge out of their way or quick pop up a shield.




1. **Supply Drops:** 
  1. You can get any gun from a supply drop but you can't use it until you unlock the base gun by leveling up.
  1. As for camos, you can unlock them normal way too but the ones from supply drops are (as far as i know) exclusive to them. So if you really like the camo on a supply drop gun then you will need to decide if you like it enough to deal with the stats/attachment (which could end up being a great combo).
  1. As of now with ""The Armory"" limiting you to 84 items that's my only gripe with the system. I would rather be able to collect all of the supply drops and have access to them when ever instead of having to remove some for other ones.



1. **Perks:**
  1. Toughness: He says it won't be a crutch perk and i believe him. Just as you said, the movement mechanics will play a part in its effectiveness. In BO2 if you started getting shot your options were to try and sprint away, get to cover, or shoot back. Now in AW, you can boost dodge to the side/backwards, double jump out of the way, pull up a shield, get extra health, or sprint away with extra speed.
  1. Blast Suppressor: It sounds like the perk stops you from showing up on the minimap but not the sound of you doing it. Also I hope that if you don't have the perk on that the symbol on the minimap it isn't a bright orange spot like you firing an unsilenced gun.
  1. Danger Close: This perk is in a category with a bunch of other great perks (Overcharged, Low Profile, Lightweight, and Flak Jacket). The main people using it will be explosive only people or people who use explosive kill streaks a lot. Explosive only people will be annoying but they won't be that bad with the movement mechanics and no C4.


1. **S&amp;D:**

When you are in Shaper select you will see four options: Predator, Hunter, Gladiator, and Tactician. For the sake of saving space, you can see what they do in full here: http://www.moba-champion.com/roles/. In this guide, I am only going to be covering on why the apply to the “Break the meta” slogan.

""why the"" should be changed to ""why they""

&gt; Remember that item Spelltheifs edge?

Isn't it Spellthief's Edge?

&gt; The last thing I would like to note on, is that there is no limited recourse in this game to cast spells, like mana. All champions have relatively low cool downs and no mana or stamina. Some heroes have a secondary bar like rage or energy, but this usually gives them second effects on skills.

1 character has 'mana' referred to as ""Spirit""... but it recharges so stupidly fast it's nearly unnoticeable. 

&gt; Spirit wells are probably one of the most interesting part of Dawngate. Spirit Wells bassicaly control your income per minute. Think of it like Starcraft, you have workers that go from a recourse pool to your base, and give you more minerals to buy items, that’s Dawngate! Spirit Wells will generate a worker every twenty seconds, and that worker will collect vim for your team (max of 18 workers.) Wells are locked to a team up until the 15:00 minute mark, and then for four minutes after being captured. In order to capture a well you need to stand on it without taking damage for 20 seconds. Also note that at any time you can kill workers, even if you can't capture the well. This helps your team as it generates less vim for the enemy team, but be careful while doing so, as the other team will have vision on you and get an alert warning of someone at their well. It is possible to take all 4 wells and have the other team generate 0 vim a minute.

Incorrect.

Solo wells take 20 seconds, for every extra allied Shaper that number decreases by 2 seconds. (Someone correct me I feel like the numbers here aren't correct, but I know there is a reduction.)

In addition every team has a base income that they will get regardless of wells own. Wells captured deny them bonus income on top of the base, and boost income for your team.

&gt; Okay, so yes, Parasite is a baron like monster, but at the same time it works so insanely different. For one the parasite will spawn and 5 minutes.

at?

&gt;  In this game, the parasite can evolve, with each of its evolution giving it a new trait. Evolutions occurs at 12:30, and 20:00 mark.

15 and 25 minute marks. No clue where you got those times.

&gt; When you kill the Parasite, an announcement will be made declaring to you and the enemy team (regardless if they have vision), stating that your team is now spawning striders. Striders are basically a super minions baddass grandmother, they are strong, tanky, and push the hell out of whatever lane they are in, that’s right, the parasite is also an inhibitor. This is important guys, you really need striders, I have never seen a game end without the winning team using the parasite to push in lanes. Parasite control is key! Ward it, secure it, take it. This thing can take you from the losing team to the winning team in a heartbeat, I really can not stress how important this guy is.

Tier 2 and Tier 3 Parasite Striders are awesome. T1 Striders suck royally.

Games have ended without para being taken. It requires extreme co-ordination.

Explain how easily Parasite can be contested and that it is in the middle of the map.

The DawnGate Gamepedia is so hilariously out of date, that you should be using TSG and Moba-Champ for pretty much everything.

&gt; As you can see each of these buffs do much different thing then in League. For the most part, I see people start with the Cute Mushroom, as he lets you spam your ability’s much faster, and move around to the other buffs quickly.

Do you want every jungle player here to hate you? Starting at the Blue Mushroom is plain out BAD ADVICE. 

If you start mushroom, I can freely invade one side, get the buff you'll consider counter-invading before you realize it and put you behind 2+ levels easily. DO NOT FOR ANY REASON START THE BLUE MUSHROOM BUFF THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME. 

If you want to give people information on jungle direct them to /u/t0ss  's videos where he goes over mechanics.

&gt; revetment 

What does this word mean?

&gt; III d. Warding

&gt; Okay, so like League and every other MoBA, Dawngate is a vision game. You need vision, just not the same way in League. If you are a revetment player, you can remember a time in League when there was no cap to wards, meaning an unlimited number of wards could be placed. Shortly after the release of Spiritstone, the cap was 3 per person, giving 15 possible wards on map, 20 if you count pinks. In Dawngate only one ward per person can be played, and it restocks in your inventory over time. This is both a good and a bad thing, it's good in the sense that no one has any reason to not ward, but bad in the sense that you must be very careful with placement. 

&gt; It's really hard to tell you exactly where to ward, but a few general notes should be taken

&gt; Never ward bushes in your lane unless you are being destroyed/camped heavily
Do not ward Parasite until mid game
Always keep one ward on Parasite late game
Ward places that will grant you the most overall vision
Communicate with the team, everyone has a ward, so if you ask someone to ward somewhere then ping it, odds are it will happen.
Try to ward key zones for the jungle during laning, getting early sight on a gank can really save your life.

We have full VIDEOS explaining where to ward AND WHY. Use them! Feel free to use pictures! This reads like a bad gamefaqs guide with one of those ASCII maps that I absolutely HATE at this point.

&gt; III e. Meta

&gt; Okay, so now we get here, the what I will assume to be most conversational part of this guide. I really don't know how to cover this games meta, you can be really creative. Most of the time, I personally see 2 glads, one being ranged and one melee, two tacticians one being utility and one being tank, and a hunter that is an off tank. But honestly, anything will work if you play it right. The only things I really advise is do not run more then 2 glads, as their isn't enough minions to take advantage of the bonuses, and don't run a predator, its bad. Aside from that, go crazy! Be sure to communicate with the team and pick what you all feel most comfortable with, and remember, if you are unsure, just go with the default 2 glad 2 tact 1 hunter.

This comes off so non-chalant and lazy the entire paragraph needs to be re-written and explained. Here's the deal:

The standard meta for DawnGate is 1 Gladiator and 1 Tactician in each lane with a Hunter roaming. This is the standard GTHTG (Gladiator-Tactician-Hunter-Tactician-Gladiator) format. Other styles of play include tri-lanes, both (GTTGT and GTTHT), while double jungle also works (HTHGT), and in the second form the solo TACTICIAN goes top. (I can go personally into why when you solo-lane you take the top if needed.) Other methods are viable but are far more difficult, since we've even seen Tri-Hunter work as well as 5 Pred (neither of these are recommended).

&gt; So Dawngate provides different items then League, yes there are a few items that are similar, but there are also many news items. To start, all items build from six base items. From there you have advanced items, which means they build from a base. Past advanced is legendary, which well, means they build from advanced. It's also key to note that advanced items build from only one base, and legendary builds from only one advanced, there is no multi recipe items in Dawngate. 

Yes, there is. 2 items specifically. Empathy and Hope which both build from Resilience and Will.

Stop using gamepedia. Don't.

&gt; IV Dawngate is fun!

Okay now, I really spent a while trying to think of what to put here. As you can tell I'm sure, I got this guide heavily from Staboteur, and I can't even start to think him for his League to dota guide. Guys I really got to say, Dawngate is an amazing game. It feels so much more laid back then League, and the game is very action oriented. I'm not going to put anything like “Dawngate is better, Dawngate is harder, etc.” and I really suggest you don't do that either. No one likes that guy that is constantly comparing League to dota, so don't be that guy in Dawngate. Yes it's a moba, but it also takes a lot of turns that League and DoTA don't. Play the game, relax, and enjoy. Try to separate that “Wow this is exactly like League” mentality, because I don't know if you noticed, but the differences section is much larger then the similarities

Reads like an excited school kid. Rewrite it.

You can't even be bothered to spell Viridian correctly?



I may be coming off as a dick (don't worry, I am), but I used to run a magazine. I think this can be made MUCH BETTER.

With my board member hat on I'd say: Having a clear idea of how you are going to issue the tokens and how you'll distribute them is crucial. You want it to be fair, you want it to be safe and compliant. 

Fair: There is clearly some work done prior to crowdsale and it makes sense to reward those who have put in their work and money into the development of the application.

Safe: Have you identified the mechanisms with which the tokens are to be issued and secured, read up on and practice the best methods on the token safe-keeping.

Compliant: It goes without saying that these tokens are not shares, so do not try to issue shares of a company that is supposed to be private-issuing shares and selling them to the public, this is a non starter.

With my decentralized applications fund member hat on I'd say:

As it so happens with tech initiatives chances are the project will evolve and pivot. If you aim to have some traction under way, then you'll likely have worked through the kinks. It will be hard to change the model-in people's minds mostly- after a crowdsale.

Beyond the certainty of the path, gaining some traction also makes sense because you want to spend the money collected, in an intelligent way. Remember the crowdsale is a boost to the development efforts and you want to have a list of targets / milestones to hit.

In addition to building out the product and giving clues about the success of the model, it also helps to have thought about: 
Who is the competition? Both centralized or decentralized.
How much money the project will need to become self sustaining. 
Do you have the incentive mechanism that will boost the adoption AND also contribute to the sustainability of the project? 
Is it easy for people to join in and provide or receive the services, are you setting up the service to take advantage of the network effect in the best possible way?

You'd need to purchase at least 7 versions of the base game to get all of the discontinued cards, 6 of which are out of print, and most of which are not commonly sold - a lot of sets on ebay are counterfiet so even if you went there, you wouldn't necessarily be getting real cards. You'd have to do the same for the four (soon to be five) expansion packs, as well as a couple of Canadien editions for the exclusive Canadian conversion kit (in several versions) and what I assume to be several UK versions with UK-exclusive cards.

That said, if you just want one of ever PRODUCT they've ever sold you could just buy the latest base game and accept there are cards that have been added and removed over the years. It may still be difficult to get certain things though like exclusive packs that were only available at events like PAX in 2013. Again, many of the ones on ebay are fake. It will also cost you hundreds of dollars if not thousands at common prices to get all of those packs even if you can find real copies.

Some people who are obsessive collectors who need to have EVERY card, have turned to self-printing the cards removed from past versions or packs they can't easily find. It's not ""official"" cards from CAH, but you would have one of every card.

Nearly 200 Buffalo State students will live in Canisius College residence halls this year – a consequence of growing enrollment at the public college and declining enrollment at the private one.

What’s happening at the two campuses, which are two miles apart, highlights a broader trend in college enrollment in Western New York.

Tens of thousands of New York residents will fill the halls and classrooms of the region’s 20 colleges and universities for the start of the 2014-15 academic year this week and next.

But the pool of potential students continues to shrink. The state Education Department projects a drop in the number of high school graduates in New York by nearly 17 percent between 2008 and 2019.

Private colleges and universities in the area are bearing the brunt of enrollment declines.

In the meantime, overall enrollment at State University of New York campuses in the region, including community colleges, saw 6 percent growth between 2008 and 2013, according to a Buffalo News analysis of federal enrollment data.

The University at Buffalo fared particularly well, even with more than 90 percent of its incoming freshmen coming from instate.

UB saw an increase of 1,690 students over the five years – the largest gain among all four-year institutions in the SUNY system.

Five years ago, UB officials promoted an ambitious plan to increase the university’s enrollment by 10,000 students. But state funding to put that plan into action never materialized, and university administrators have quietly backed away from that goal.

This year, UB reduced the target size of its freshman class to 3,350, down from 3,512 in 2013.

“We want to make sure the students we bring in can get their classes,” said Lee H. Melvin, vice provost for enrollment management. “Right now, the plan for us is to stay stable.”

Buffalo State had 198 fewer students in 2013 than in 2008, but a record-setting freshmen class of 2,000 this year will more than reverse the previous declines.

The class includes Shedeene Hewitt, of the Bronx, one of the more than 1,000 freshmen forced to triple up this year because of the huge influx of new students and renovations at a large campus dormitory.

“They tripled up a lot of people, so I figured there were a lot of acceptances this year,” said Hewitt, who will study political science.

Hewitt and her roommates spent part of their first day on campus determining how to reconfigure their Porter Hall room for three people instead of two.

“Right now, it’s tight, but when we all learn to work around each other, it’s not going to be that tight,” she said.

Canisius College had the exact opposite problem this year: lots of dorm space and not enough students to fill it.

The area’s private colleges and universities collectively saw an enrollment decline of nearly 5 percent between 2008 and 2013. Canisius had 388 fewer students in 2013 than in 2008 – about an 8 percent drop.

Medaille College, located between Buffalo State and Canisius, had the steepest decline, 860 students, or 27 percent – although all of that drop-off was in graduate students.

The declines contributed to a $2.2 million deficit last year and prompted college officials in May to shut down the college’s satellite campus in Amherst.

The demographic trough, combined with a brutal recession that steered many would-be students away from college because they simply could not afford it, has led to plenty of soul-searching among administrators.

Area institutions have hired new enrollment managers, redoubled their efforts to recruit students from outside Western and Central New York, opened their doors to more veterans seeking higher education and expanded online course offerings. Four-year schools are putting a heavier emphasis on attracting students from community colleges.

“Enrollment is definitely our biggest priority right now,” said Sister Denise A. Roche, president of D’Youville College, one of a few campuses that managed to gain students over the last five years.

The area’s largest private institution, Canisius College, had an undergraduate population as high as 3,485 in 2007.

But college officials have recalibrated their expectations, and the Jesuit school will likely enroll on the level of 2,500 undergraduates for the foreseeable future, said President John J. Hurley.

Canisius and other schools want to back away from discounting tuition in an effort to fill seats – a practice that has hurt the bottom line at many colleges, which rely heavily on tuition for the bulk of their revenue.

“When you set unrealistically high targets for whatever reason, you then build a cost structure around that, and if the revenue doesn’t materialize, then you’re stuck with the cost,” Hurley said.

Canisius has trimmed $12 million from its operating budget over the last three years, mostly through attrition. This May, 13 nonteaching positions were cut, and a handful of tenured faculty members accepted early retirement incentives. So far, the college has been able to avoid laying off untenured faculty, but it’s still a possibility, Hurley said.

St. Bonaventure University, located outside Olean, recently laid off two staff members and reduced some employees from 12-month to 10-month annual contracts. The university also offered a buyout to senior faculty members.

Overall enrollment at St. Bonaventure dropped by 7 percent in the last five years, and this year’s numbers aren’t any higher.

The freshman class is smaller than what university officials aimed for, despite intensified student recruitment efforts.

“We find we’re working three times harder for every student we land,” said Sister Margaret Carney, president of St. Bonaventure. “We’re off by about 45 in our freshman count. That’s steep for us, and we’d like to build that up next year.”

The lion’s share of undergraduate students at all of the 20 colleges and universities in Western New York traditionally have been state residents.

Demographic realities helped spur the ongoing discussions between St. Bonaventure and Hilbert College in Hamburg about a possible “strategic alliance.”

Private college and university presidents acknowledged that SUNY schools present an increasingly formidable challenge.

“There is no question that SUNY is a significant competition for us,” Hurley said. “The price point is the issue.”

Another factor for the area’s seven Catholic colleges and universities is the decline of the parochial school network in Western New York, which has been battered by dozens of closures over the last decade.

“Those served as a kind of informal feeder system,” Carney said.

Students displaced by Catholic school closures into the public school system are less inclined to seek out a Catholic higher education, she added.

Canisius, looking to expand its reach, plans to focus on the Chicago area as a potential new source of students. Students from warmer parts of the country are less likely to be interested in Canisius, and Chicago still has a significant network of Catholic elementary and high schools, Hurley said.

But any payoff from boosting recruitment in an area probably won’t happen for years, he said.

“There really isn’t a way for an institution to open up a spigot in Cleveland or Chicago and have the students flow,” he said. “It involves a lot of personal relationships. There is no way to go into a new market and flood it with advertising. That’s not the way it’s done.”

Canisius hopes to get more students in the future from Maryland, Washington, D.C., and northern Virginia – a population-dense region where St. Bonaventure also is putting more emphasis, along with Philadelphia, New Jersey and Long Island.

Like D’Youville, some private colleges have bucked the trend of shrinking enrollments, at least so far.

Daemen College and Hilbert College saw slight enrollment growth in 2013, compared with 2008.

At Trocaire College, in South Buffalo, the student body grew by a third – to 1,457 students – and college officials are aiming for 1,500 students in the near future.

Villa Maria College recently announced plans for a residence hall and intercollegiate sports as part of a long-term effort to double enrollment at the Cheektowaga campus.

“We have to grow through our challenges,” said Brian J. Emerson, vice president for enrollment management and student services at Villa Maria.""",1,pete716,True,t3_2embjx,0,ck0tevf,0,1427353004,

Assumptions:

* You can afford $29 up front
* You can afford $20/week for 3 months
* You're an average player who is semi-serious about the game and wants to collect a playset (4 of each card as well as have a couple of competitive decks)

With your initial payment of $29, buy:

* 15 Set 1 packs off the AH for ~$1.3 ($20)
* Set aside $5 for 5 x Swiss Tournaments
* Subscribe for the VIP program for 1 month $4

Week 1

* Play 5 x Swiss Tournaments (1 tourney a day takes about 3 hours)
* Each player has about 85% chance to win at least 1 round which rewards you with one pack, so let's assume that you win 4 rounds out of 5 tourneys - you get 4 packs
* You get 1 pack a week from VIP

Week 2

* You start with 5 packs and have $20 in your account
* Buy 10 Set 1 packs from the AH for $13
* Play 5 drafts, get 5 packs at the end of the week

Repeat for 3 months.

You get to choose 450 cards per week. At the end of 3 months, you will have amassed 5400 cards (A playset of Set 1 is 1360 cards) and assuming you diligently sell extras and buy cards that you need off the AH, you will definitely have completed more than 85% of your collection and will have at least one competitive deck that can do well in the bigger tourneys. 

What have you accomplished at the end of 3 months?

* Total $ spent = $20 x 12 weeks, $29 initial, 3 x $4 VIP = $281
* Hours of entertainment = 3 x 5 x 12 = 180
* Cost of entertainment = $1.6/hour
* Account balance from $2 difference/week = $24

This is a very, very conservative cost estimate. I haven't considered: 

* Platinum you make from sales of extras 
* Winning more than one booster a tourney
* Chances of winning a primal pack

So, realistically, assuming a 10% discount on the total cost, you could probably:

* Get a Set 1 playset for $250 
* Become a much better drafter with 3 months of practice
* Set yourself up for gold grinding in PvE when it comes out

0,,t1_ck0gpuh,6,1409013069,,t3_2ejcu9,False,WritingPrompts,False,,t5_2s3nb,"Lynk, a multifaceted global corporation that made its millions when its CEO Syllus Manning invented the Quantum Distortion Field. A device capable of transporting a single person to a coupled unit anywhere in the world in an instant. Teleportation, like something out of a sci-fi movie or something. Travel became instantaneous, congestion, a thing of the past. Time became more about fulfillment than anything else well, for most of us anyway. For one small device it had a huge effect on us and the way we interacted with the world. Man, were we duped.



""Hey Jakob, what's up man?"" The sudden greeting pulling me from morning trance. I still wasn't fully awake yet, 9 am starts did this to me every time. Dazed and only half conscious. ""Oh hey Darrel, sorry about that"". Darrel was a tall and dark man. Semi-pro basketball player in his spare time and a serious fitness freak. ""Arn't you bright and cheery this morning"" I went on. ""Ha! you need to get some vits in that scrawny ass body of yours"" he joked. This was our routine. Working with friends always has a way of making the day not suck as much as it normally would.

""You takin' the QDF to work ?"" I asked during the walk from the local Auto-taxi rank to the local station. ""Nah its only a couple of miles and Lynk can handle things without me for an hour or so, I figure its such a nice day why not walk"" Darrell replied a half grin plastered across his face. I glared at him through narrow eyes ""Dude you say that every day "" I said begrudgingly. His grin widened ""That's coz it always is"". ""Urgh"" I noise I thought perfectly emphasized my lack of enthusiasm ""Fine then, But there is no way you are forcing me to join you again"" His lips parted to produce his clamped teeth in an almost sadistic smile.

Not again , why are we running again ? We do this every morning. Ever since Lynk opened its doors and we managed to secure a position each on the security teams. We always ran. It would start out as a leisurely walk, and then Darrel would run off ahead and I'd have to keep up with him. By the time we got to the giant glass tower of Lynk global headquarters I felt like my lungs were going to give out. ""Come on Jake, I went easy on you today coz I pushed you so hard at the gym last night"". I stood hunched over, hands on knees, breathing heavily and sweating profusely. ""Why do we run every-freakin'-morning?"" I complained between husking breaths. ""No way your pinning this on me man, I run, you choose to follow me"" Darrel said with that same sadistic smile. ""Fuck..."" A breath ""...You"" . ""HaHa!"" two simple sounds had never conveyed so much evil, I remember thinking when he gave his customary short laugh. I always thought it wasn't to signify something was funny but he derived great pleasure from causing someone else misfortune. ""Let's head inside man"" Darrel said after I finally stood up straight. ""Yeah"" I replied and nodded.

The inside of the building was almost all white. A circular front desk stood about 20 yards away, passed the security checkpoint, manned by the seemingly ever present beautiful receptionists. ""Hey Jake, Darrel, Head on in guys Chief Mallony wants to see you two"" Karl, the day post guard. ""Thanks Karl we'll head on up now"" Darrel replied for the both of us. After a quick second scanning our I.D.s the gates let us pass and we headed left through the retina scanner protected guard door and into the locker room. ""Whadda ya think the Chief wants ?"" I asked Darrel whilst stripping off my jacket and replacing it with my matt white nanotube vest and side arm holster. ""Probably another bullshit assignment in the parking lot of something"" he replied, his voice filled with spite. ""Yeah he does seemed to have it in for us."" I said, walking over to grab my side from it genetically locked case on the far wall. 

We moved through the unseen corridors of the security wards with relative ease now. Knowledge of every pipe and radiator grill ingrained into our minds. When we first started here these tunnels, referred to as *The rats nest* by the employees was a maze but over the years we had managed to adapt and move here as swiftly as we could anywhere. Originally designed for ventilation of the Lynk tower, nicknamed Babel by the security staff, ran the length , width and height of the entire tower and was now used by the security personnel for rapid response to emergencies within the tower. We arrived on the 4th floor and the end of corridor 7 from the security only access port. What greeted us upon our exit was the steel door and blacked out windows of the briefing room across the hall. 

""Reporting, Sir"" Said Darrel upon entering, directed at the chief of course. ""Will you two ever be on time ?"" Chief Mallony spat through barely contained fury. ""Sorry Chief"" replied Darrel, surprisingly apologetic ""It won't happen again"" an obvious lie, but enough to sedate the chief. I looked around the room. The rest of the squad had already arrived, Mac, Carol and Leon the unspoken leader of our team. ""Ok you guys will be patrolling the basement labs today"" Chief Mallony ordered ""Uh Chief ?"" Mallony shot a glance and raised his left eye brow ""What is it Maconahey ?"" he groaned still clearly pissed at Darrel and me. ""Well don't the earthworms- Err I mean- the basement laboratory personnel have automated defenses why do they need us ?"" Mac replied with just a hint of insubordination. ""Basement defenses are down for the day while maintenance is done you guys are the eyes, ears and guns down their today"" replied the chief.

The basement levels of Babel weren't much different from the rest of the tower, besides a lack of windows of course. Bleach white hallways interspersed with automatic glass doors leading to all kinds of different labs and offices. As security personnel we didn't have clearance to enter the labs except in an emergency so we had no idea what research was being done here and it wasn't our job to know so we didn't care. ""Well isn't this cozy"" Mac said with a smile nudging Carol with his elbow ""wanna go find a quiet storage closet"" he continued with a smirk. Carol shot him a glance through narrow eyes ""I will snap your scrawny neck little man"" at this point me and Darrel burst out laughing ""Give it up man"" I said through tears of laughter ""she gets more pissed at you every time"" I said still laughing. ""Enough!"" barked Leon and the corridor fell silent ""We have a job to do here, lets rendezvous with the lower sector security post"" We all began walking in silence. It wasn't so much that we were afraid of Leon but he commanded a lot of respect. Ex-military or so they say. He never talks about it and we're not sure we want to know. All we know is he is quiet, confident, focused and competent and he can take down Darrel in a fight, something we have all seen first hand. 

The lower sector security post was, from what we could tell, perfectly normal. Nothing broken, no glass, everything in the right place, no abnormalities what so ever. Besides the fact that it was barren. Not a guard in sight. In fact we hadn't seen any security personnel since we arrived down here and the fact that we were sent to relieve another team and that team isn't around, never mind the rotary posted guards, was ... odd to say the least. ""Hey Leon, where is everyone ?"" asked Mac sounding more bewildered than worried. ""Yeah man its like they just up and disappeared"" added Darrel ""Come to think of it, we haven't seen anyone since we came down here"" I remarked. ""yeah genius we know, that's what everyone is talking about"" said Carol with her ever present sneer ""No I mean, anyone, not just the guards, but there's no staff either"" everyone suddenly looked at me, faces either shocked or in thought ""no techies, no scientists not even a freakin' clerk or cleaner, there's no one down here, not anyone I have noticed anyway"" I went on. ""Don't be stupid Jake we saw someone earlier"" replied Mac , clearly not believing it himself. ""Oh yeah , where then ?"" replied Carol ""there was that , Ah- erm-"" Mac paused ""yeah no one, Jakob's right, this place is deserted"" Carol said turning to Leon ""Boss man, want me to call it in ?"" Leon looked up from the patch of carpet in the security office he was staring at and directly at Carol. ""No - No we have to find out where these people are, don't want to panic the powers that be until we know for certain they arn't around here"" said Leon as calm and collected as ever. ""Yeah your right, they could all just be a having a tea party on the fucking beach!"" replied Mac clearly rattled. ""come on lets check the other floors"" I suggested ""Mac radio upstairs and ask for another team, if they ask for a reason, tell them I have on site command"" ordered Leon. Mac pressed the button on the side of his ear piece. ""Security main gate this is team Gamma can we get another team in the lower section please"" ... ""Main Gate ?"" ... ""Main gate come in""... ""No answer Leon , just getting some weird static"" Mac said clearly calming down. ""hmm that's odd, something must be jamming us"" Leon now deep in thought. ""Alright, Mac you stay here and try to by pass the computers"" he said pointing at the security command consoles ""and try to rig up a booster for our transmitters, Jakob you and Carol sweep level B3 and Darrel we will take B4 , no one descend any lower than B4 until we get some answers"" we all exchanged glances and nodded. ""Alright team break!""

* Even though we won powerups, we lost the match.  Also, the powerups all were taken within seconds of the last one, so that by the end of the match the powerups all 3 powerups were reappearing at the ""25"" mark. This isn't anything we really need to ""work"" on, but we just need to know that more than any other map the powerups will usually stay close to on time.  You don't really need to time powerups, rather just get them when they show up.

* We got beat because they pulled off ""anti-regrab"" and we didn't.  It worked for them and they didn't need powerups to beat us, their strategy in general was better than ours. We had no chance, and if we played the match 10 more times with the same strategies we could get beat 10 times.  We have to practice anti-regrab at all our practices for our match on Blastoff this weekend. 

* PM/Slide made a few boost spikes, both of them would benefit by just running around the map for 5-10 minutes by themselves and just practicing all the angles.

* Gin/Slide had way too many flaccid grabs, especially coming off Boombox where they almost never flaccid grabbed. Utilizing the same ""conservative"" mindset would do wonders for our team, although its harder on blastoff because of how quickly they can end up in base.

* After watching 4 matches of Felix/PM play together, it's clear that PM is the slight better of the two at making open field tags, and Felix is the slight better of the two at containment.  Based on this, I think the winning formula would be for PM+FC to do the chasing, and have Felix be on anti-regrab.  The anti-regrab person has to do a very nice job of containment 1v1, and it could use some practice 1v1 with someone to get good at it in that specific base.

* **We lost** 3-6

**Middle Powerup**: **They** won 4-6

**Right Powerup**: **We** won 7-3

**Total Powerups**: **We** won 16-14 

[Match 2, Half 1, 8:52](http://www.twitch.tv/legmantv/b/561669501?t=32m06s)

* Stalin gets a flag rolling bomb and slide has flagpro. Slide spikes himself on accident and since im high has a tagpro also, they are easily able to block out the front of their base for a cap.

* **Whose fault was the cap?** Mainly slide for popping himself, PM could have probably done a better job at moving to stop Stalin but he thought stalin would use im high as a TP-lead but it probably wouldn't have mattered even if he guessed right.

[Match 2, Half 1, 7:38](http://www.twitch.tv/legmantv/b/561669501?t=33m19s)

* Both teams have the flag again, Slide with rolling bomb and Tiza with nothing. Slide gets diffused and quickly cornered bby Stalin/bally, and Tiza boosts up top and with Ginseng being blocked out they easily score.

* **Whose fault was the cap?** Slide should have tried to keep evading more instead of get cornered, Felix missed a boost to get out of position, PM guessed wrong and was in a bad position to stop him from boosting, and Ginseng reacted too late (probably due to us poorly communicating with him) to be able to avoid being blocked out.  Not our finest team moment.

[Match 2, Half 1, 7:26](http://www.twitch.tv/legmantv/b/561669501?t=33m31s)

* Immediately after they score they score again by getting regrab and having all 3 people defending being in poor positions. Ginseng flaccid grabbed which wasn't totally his fault, PM should have been on the button, and Felix had no idea where to go so he went to clog the top-middle.

* **Whose fault was the cap?** Mostly PM for not getting on that button. 

[Match 2, Half 1, 6:06](http://www.twitch.tv/legmantv/b/561669501?t=34m52s)

* Slide/Stalin have the flag, and while Slide stays alive, PM tracks down Stalin. Tiza is on regrab and spikes himself leaving an open lane for Slide to easily score.

* **Who helped score the cap?** Slide did a solid job, PM did a good job getting a return, but mostly it is Tiza for spiking himself.

[Match 2, Half 1, 4:11](http://www.twitch.tv/legmantv/b/561669501?t=036m47s)

* Stalin is trying to score but PM snipes him, and im high then uses the base bomb, boosts into the blastoff, and scores quickly.

* **Whose fault was the cap?** Slide flaccid grabbed making it hard for us to start with.  Felix shouldn't have followed PM since they were both going to the same spot leaving open the corners.  If we communicated better (we didn't) ginseng could have moved to block the blastoff but as it was he had no idea.

[Match 2, Half 1, 3:23](http://www.twitch.tv/legmantv/b/561669501?t=37m35s)

* Slide has rolling bomb in our base and im high is running around the map with the flag. Slide gets diffused and cornered in our base and im high allows tiza to use tagpro to clear out the base and make room for him to cap.

* **Whose fault was the cap?** Slide for waiting in our base for too long, but not much more than that.  The real reason they scored was Tiza got incredibly lucky to snipe Felix blindly. 

[Match 2, Half 1, 2:55](http://www.twitch.tv/legmantv/b/561669501?t=038m02s)

* PM/Felix do a nice job to contain im high and tag him, while slide evades. Tiza then accidentally snipes himself into PM and Slide is free to cap.

* **Who helped score the cap?** PM/Felix for containing tagging, and Slide for solid flag-running.

[Match 2, Half 1, 2:36](http://www.twitch.tv/legmantv/b/561669501?t=038m23s)

* Stalin grabs the flag right after we score and Felix is being pushed out by the anti-regrab.  As Stalin goes up, Felix goes to get powerup and slide doesn't block the middle well enough and they score.

* **Whose fault was the cap?** PM for boosting for no reason, Felix for collecting that powerup while Stalin was coming in, and Slide for not positioning himself in a good enough spot.

[Match 2, Half 1, 2:24](http://www.twitch.tv/legmantv/b/561669501?t=038m34s)

* Ginseng grabs the flag with juke juice and PM clears our base by killing two people, and blocks the front to kill a 3rd boosting in.  Easy cap.

* **Who helped score the cap?** PM for using his TagPro to good effectiveness and Ginseng for a nice escape with juke juice.",1,PrivateMajor,True,t3_2ekfn6,0,ck0bii3,0,1427361599,

And what could have happened and I said COULD HAVE HAPPENED was that the player could have been AFK then got back and collected tags. He also could have had lag based on the hosts connection. And messing around is not BS it is called having fun you probably take the game too seriously and tryhard all the time. Either way our clan wars was over and they won that game any ways so its not bad. And these are statements of what might have happened and when are you not allowed to have fun? and also it is completely legal for someone to join a game and play and they were not boosting most likely and he did not even get a 2kd that game so he could not have boosted. They should have been banned and not the whole clan being taken off the LB and if that is fair explain how. And pyrelus  there is no video evidence to back up what he said or what I have said.

In a 1v2 situation the Defender needs to have an advantage, but only if they are defending an objective.  As someone else pointed out it is very likely that experienced players are going to zone the defender out of the creep wave, so your chances of collecting that vim is slim, unless you're playing someone like ashabelle.  Even still, as a Defender, you're not getting that extra vim bonus for cs, so it should even out (again all of these ideas would need extensive play testing to verify).  I do like the potion idea though, very cool.

I think the one thing maybe we're forgetting is that you could end up with a 1v1 situation as well.  So in this case there needs to not be penalties for pushing a lane, which is why I think the bush ward makes sense, giving you just a little extra visibility so you're not getting ganked.  However, I will concede that it is strong, and that perhaps it needs to fall to your missing lane partner on the team to help you out with their ward.

It very well may be that the Defender roll is more optimized for draft mode (Waystone pls!), but I don't think that's a problem at all.

&gt; How to earn massive gp fast, as of now simply onslaught wave 3 restart and repeat if the only one for good gp fast.

Objective game modes generally allow for you to play the full time meaning you get the time spent GP bonus.

&gt; Will there be hrv scopes? Aka 2-3 seconds of hrv with a 7-10 second recharge.

Likely not, closest you'll get to an effect like that would be the infrared scopes.

&gt; Can you move with shooting with cloak active? Mk2 of course.

Nope, that would be way overpowered. Halo gets away with it because the cloak system doesn't work well anyway and everyone's a bullet-sponge. With how quickly and easily you die in Blacklight that wouldn't be fair.

&gt; Why does that bastard machete not lunge every time and of will just slash and then lunge after a random swing miss. I love my machete, but dang.

No idea, the melee's been crazy since forever. Kinda fun at times, but widely unpredictable from my experience (long time ago when the breach hammer would fling you across the map).

&gt; Onslaught. Best build opinions, any gear, for solo survival and winning. I usually play with bad ransoms where I carry objectives and 70% of kills.

If the parts are available, I suggest a full damage AR with a double drum magazine. Heal/revival injectors are great, cloak could work to your advantage, ammo refill could work too. For health I'd suggest the 210-220 range. Recommended gear would be at least a melee weapon in case you run out of ammo.

&gt; Idea, would anyone like a chakram or boomerang type weapon similar to throwing knife but returns, causing a catch animation to take play for 2 secs.

That would be interesting. I'm not quite sure how the widespread community would take the idea, but I'd have to see it work to really have an opinion.

&gt; Why is there no bullet penetration?

Blacklight's combat system allows for quick kills, any more opportunity to kill like that would make it a little BS.

&gt; Will we get a suicide option in the pause screen? I get under the map, by accident, multiple times or spawn with no gun and just need a death to get back to normal.

Would be nice, but PC doesn't even have that yet.

&gt; Will search and destroy be boosted, like either more xp per kill (because entire match respawn) or like 20-40 go per round if you win, 10 for completion if lost. EG win 6 of 10 get 120gp bonus, loser gets 40gp.

That would be nice, but since S&amp;D's launch it's always been this weak (reward-wise).

&gt; Speaking of throwing knifes, can you collect it after throwing it and it misses or hits? Arrows vary, 100% pick up for misses but 40% for bodies. Also can you pick up other peoples knives? What about other peoples arrows?

You can recollect your knives, not so sure about others' knives/arrows.

&gt; Will we get achievement based titles or emblems? Like ""Hardened"" for 500 hardsuit kills, while it, or ""Hard on stealer"" for burning out and stealing the hardsuit x times.

That would be neat, but I have no idea about any upcoming titles, last title we got was for the level 50 update.

&gt; Seriously annoying, why can't I buy emotes for gp. I want roar and bring it, but not for zen.

I think there's only a select few that can be purchased for GP, such as the crane emote.",3,Feffington,True,t3_2eja0w,0,ck080m3,0,1427363230,

&gt; **Continued Improvements to the Megaserver System**
&gt; 
&gt; We’ll be using the September 2014 Feature Pack to bring some exciting changes to the megaserver system!
&gt; 
&gt; Since first introducing it in the April 2014 Feature Pack, we’ve kept on improving the megaserver system on a regular basis. A lot of those changes were made during regularly scheduled updates and were targeted at improving what we call “integrity” metrics, which are how we measure how well the system works to get you into a map instance with people from your party, guild, home world, and language. Because the evolution was continuous and smooth, you might not have noticed much change, but the metrics got a lot better over time as we kept making the system smarter. We won’t stop there: with the second feature pack, we’re releasing some new systems and working to make the core system more effective!
&gt; 
&gt; **Global Guilds (New to North America and Europe)**
&gt; 
&gt; When we released the megaserver system, we told you that we’d be focusing on guilds for future improvements, and now we’re ready to introduce the global guild system to North America and Europe! This system has already been rolled out in China, and we’re very excited to bring it back over to our other regions. Instead of having a separate guild chapter on each world, everything in your guild—your bank, merits, influence, and upgrades—is now global and shared across all worlds. We built this in a way that makes sure that nothing is being lost for anyone:
&gt; 
&gt; * The influence and the merits that your guild earned in each world will now be combined into your global guild. To make sure that you’re not losing anything there, the combined merits quantity can go over the normal limit of 250. However, your guild will not be able to earn more merits until the count gets back under that threshold.
&gt; * Any upgrade you’ve unlocked on any world will be available in your global guild. If you’ve unlocked the same upgrade on multiple worlds, the influence and merit cost will be refunded. Again, the refunded merits will be allowed to exceed the normal limit, but you will be unable to earn more merits while over the limit.
&gt; * All guild consumables unlocked on any world will be available in your global guild. For this purpose, the number of consumables in stock can go over the usual limits, but you will not be able to build new consumables of the same type before going back under the usual threshold.
&gt; * Guild boosts that are enabled will be returned to your guild inventory and you will have to reenable them from your global guild to activate them.
&gt; * The guild vault from the world that had the highest number of slots will become your global guild vault. If your guild had the same number of slots on multiple worlds, it’ll pick the one with the most items. However, the items from other worlds’ banks will not be lost—instead, their contents will be put into extra slots, which will only be available to withdraw from and will disappear once empty.
&gt; 
&gt; **Guild Missions Improvement**
&gt; 
&gt; Since the launch of the megaserver system, we’ve improved guild missions by making sure that all missions could be completed by multiple guilds simultaneously. With this feature pack, we’re making getting your guild together for a mission easier than ever by introducing significant improvements to the way guild missions work in the open world. The megaserver system will be extended with a reservation system that is automatically enabled whenever a guild member joins a map to do a guild mission, which will prioritize adding guild members to that map. This system, however, is limited in the number of spaces that get reserved on the map instance, so it’ll work best for small- and medium-sized guilds.
&gt; 
&gt; We are working on further improvements that are focused on larger guilds.
&gt; 
&gt; **Finding Allies in Different Map Copies**
&gt; 
&gt; As the population on a map changes over time, the megaserver system sometimes needs to close certain copies of that map. It does that by ceasing to add new players to that map (unless they intentionally join to be with their party) and by waiting until that map copy is empty to finally close it. This has occasionally created an odd experience for players left in the map, who will see fewer and fewer companions.
&gt; 
&gt; With the September 2014 Feature Pack, we’re introducing a new mechanism to solve this problem. When certain copies of a map need to be closed, the players on those copies will be notified and will have the option to be moved to a different map copy right away. This will help you make sure that there are always allies by your side, and it’ll help us more efficiently manage maps—which in turn makes everyone’s experience better. If you choose to volunteer to move to a new map, you’ll even get a reward in the form of a new effect, the Volunteer’s Blessing, which increases movement speed by 15%, karma gain by 5%, and experience from kills by 10% for 10 minutes. This effect persists if you move to another map, but the movement speed bonus is applied only in PvE.
&gt; 
&gt; **Language in Europe**
&gt; 
&gt; One experience we’ve been working to improve between April and today is the European language diversity. We’ve deployed several system updates to better sort players by language, especially when the population on a specific map is high.
&gt; 
&gt; This is an important issue for us, and we’re still working hard on improving the game experience for our European players.
&gt; 
&gt; For now, we’ve decided not to entirely separate the different language communities onto unique map copies. While we understand that it might be difficult for some to communicate across the language barrier, we still think it’s important to have maps that feel populated no matter where in Tyria you go or at which hours you play. The megaserver system gives us an opportunity to expand the game world without having to fear that doing so would make some of the older parts of Tyria feel empty to the players who’d still like to enjoy them; splitting the European community by language would hinder that capacity to some extent. Our hope is to avoid doing so, relying instead on systematic improvements to megaservers and our amazingly friendly and awesome community of players.

We’ll be using the September 2014 Feature Pack to bring some exciting changes to the megaserver system!

Since first introducing it in the April 2014 Feature Pack, we’ve kept on improving the megaserver system on a regular basis. A lot of those changes were made during regularly scheduled updates and were targeted at improving what we call “integrity” metrics, which are how we measure how well the system works to get you into a map instance with people from your party, guild, home world, and language. Because the evolution was continuous and smooth, you might not have noticed much change, but the metrics got a lot better over time as we kept making the system smarter. We won’t stop there: with the second feature pack, we’re releasing some new systems and working to make the core system more effective!

###Global Guilds (New to North America and Europe)
When we released the megaserver system, we told you that we’d be focusing on guilds for future improvements, and now we’re ready to introduce the global guild system to North America and Europe! This system has already been rolled out in China, and we’re very excited to bring it back over to our other regions. Instead of having a separate guild chapter on each world, everything in your guild—your bank, merits, influence, and upgrades—is now global and shared across all worlds. We built this in a way that makes sure that nothing is being lost for anyone:

* The influence and the merits that your guild earned in each world will now be combined into your global guild. To make sure that you’re not losing anything there, the combined merits quantity can go over the normal limit of 250. However, your guild will not be able to earn more merits until the count gets back under that threshold.

* Any upgrade you’ve unlocked on any world will be available in your global guild. If you’ve unlocked the same upgrade on multiple worlds, the influence and merit cost will be refunded. Again, the refunded merits will be allowed to exceed the normal limit, but you will be unable to earn more merits while over the limit.

* All guild consumables unlocked on any world will be available in your global guild. For this purpose, the number of consumables in stock can go over the usual limits, but you will not be able to build new consumables of the same type before going back under the usual threshold.

* Guild boosts that are enabled will be returned to your guild inventory and you will have to reenable them from your global guild to activate them.

* The guild vault from the world that had the highest number of slots will become your global guild vault. If your guild had the same number of slots on multiple worlds, it’ll pick the one with the most items. However, the items from other worlds’ banks will not be lost—instead, their contents will be put into extra slots, which will only be available to withdraw from and will disappear once empty.

###Guild Missions Improvement

Since the launch of the megaserver system, we’ve improved guild missions by making sure that all missions could be completed by multiple guilds simultaneously. With this feature pack, we’re making getting your guild together for a mission easier than ever by introducing significant improvements to the way guild missions work in the open world. The megaserver system will be extended with a reservation system that is automatically enabled whenever a guild member joins a map to do a guild mission, which will prioritize adding guild members to that map. This system, however, is limited in the number of spaces that get reserved on the map instance, so it’ll work best for small- and medium-sized guilds.

We are working on further improvements that are focused on larger guilds.

###Finding Allies in Different Map Copies
As the population on a map changes over time, the megaserver system sometimes needs to close certain copies of that map. It does that by ceasing to add new players to that map (unless they intentionally join to be with their party) and by waiting until that map copy is empty to finally close it. This has occasionally created an odd experience for players left in the map, who will see fewer and fewer companions.

With the September 2014 Feature Pack, we’re introducing a new mechanism to solve this problem. When certain copies of a map need to be closed, the players on those copies will be notified and will have the option to be moved to a different map copy right away. This will help you make sure that there are always allies by your side, and it’ll help us more efficiently manage maps—which in turn makes everyone’s experience better. If you choose to volunteer to move to a new map, you’ll even get a reward in the form of a new effect, the Volunteer’s Blessing, which increases movement speed by 15%, karma gain by 5%, and experience from kills by 10% for 10 minutes. This effect persists if you move to another map, but the movement speed bonus is applied only in PvE.

###Language in Europe

One experience we’ve been working to improve between April and today is the European language diversity. We’ve deployed several system updates to better sort players by language, especially when the population on a specific map is high.

This is an important issue for us, and we’re still working hard on improving the game experience for our European players.

For now, we’ve decided not to entirely separate the different language communities onto unique map copies. While we understand that it might be difficult for some to communicate across the language barrier, we still think it’s important to have maps that feel populated no matter where in Tyria you go or at which hours you play.

2. Turn graphics settings all the way up (note FPS)
3. Turn graphics settings all the way down (note FPS)

Customization is done just like D3, you have a powers page, and ever time you level up or do certain missions you get a power point to assign.  YOu have both active and passive powers to assign points to.  The game is mostly populated with well known heroes at the moment but there's enough characters and enough different costumes that no you don't see  abunch of one toon running around except on new toon release day which is once a month.  Then you may see that one toon running around a lot.  Further customization is done through slotting gear, there's oh i don't know, about 15 different item slots to equip all of them available in white, blue, purple, yellow and orange varieties.

Then there's the omega tree which is a giant passive skill tree similar to Path of Exile, you earn omega points to spend via collecting XP .  They do that to let you keep evolving your toon past the level 60 cap, omega points are capped at 7000 which they figure will take the average person a year to earn.  If you have 10 points you can spend 10 points in the tree for every toon you have.  Also there's roster synergies you can turn on, each toon gives you passive buffs at level 25 and 50 and you can turn those boosts on for each toon you own.

The game isn't pay to win, nothing you can buy makes you any better than anyone else just like Path of Exile.

For end game content there's daily challenges, raiding, cosmic terminals and one-shot missions.  There is also X-Def (wave defensive) and MIdtown Manhattan patrol but you can play those really at any level.

I have noticed a lot of frustrated players both on reddit and on the elite forums. Most of the frustration seems to come from the fact that it takes ages to actually make any money so you can buy the juicy ships and equipment.

So here comes the story of how i made 3 million in one weekend. (Game version 1.03 Beta)
It requires some level of grinding but nothing to tedious, the risk is also pretty low if you run solo or private group. It does however require you to know and understand the basics of elite gameplay (like managing power distribution to your weapons) including dogfighting.

Since you start with the sidewinder you are pretty limited in what you can do, most bulletin board mission pay next to nothing and are sometimes very dangerous (Like the ""Kill the Pirate Lord"" mission which pays 6000 credits, sounds good right, except he is in an Anaconda that will blow up your sidewinder in seconds)

Here is how I did it. (There are of course variations of this and you can most likely do something similar in most systems, I chose Eranin because it is close to the staging area by planet 2, about 800 Ls)
Grab your trusty sidewinder and go to Eranin. Supercruise to Planet 2. When you come really close to the planet (below 2 Ls) one or more contacts will pop up outside your cockpit. The one you are looking for is called ""Federal distress signal"". Target it and exit supercruise when instructed too. You should find yourself in a battle between Federal and Eranin forces, there is also a Federal Dreadnought on the battlefield but don't worry about it, unless you crash into it it won't hurt you. 

The first thing you need to do is to choose which faction to fight for (Don't worry about getting shot at, until you choose sides the AI will not engage you) 
You do this by going into your right interface panel. Since we are in Eranin and we want to fight for the winning side we choose to join the Eranin Defence force. Now a bunch of Federal fighters will turn red and you can go ahead and start popping them one by one, every kill you get gives you 350 cr in a bounty voucher which you can turn in for cash at the Eranin Station. If you are somewhat proficient at dogfighting you should make about 20.000 credits in 30 minutes. The enemy will constantly jump in new fighters which are really easy to take down even with the sidewinder. The only things you have to be careful of are the following:

1. Don't stand still (This is pretty much the only way you can get shot down by the AI)
2. Watch out for the big ass dreadnought, it won't shoot you but flying into it while maneuvering at high speed will make your ship go poof.
3. Be careful of head to head passes against the AI, this is the only way i have died doing these missions. Sometimes when you go head to head you get a little bit overconfident before you make evasive maneuvers and both of you end up crashing into each other creating a massive fireball.
Dying will make you loose all your bounty vouchers that you haven't turned at the station
4. Turn in your vouchers at the station every 30 minutes or so, set a timer on your phone if necessary, it really sucks to have been collecting bountys for 2 hours straight when suddenly something goes wrong and you loose them all, believe me!

Ok, so after about an hour or two you should have a minimum of 30k in you'r wallet, probably closer to 60k. Go buy an Eagle, equip it with 3 C2 pulse lasers, you can go for more fancy guns but remember that although the Eagle is the most nimble fighter in the game the powerplant is made from recycled scrapyard parts and it will overheat in a heartbeat. Blow up some more shit and maybe change to C1 gimbaled lasers, don't use multicannons, although they are very good they use ammo that cost money and requires you to go back and rearm at the station all the time, especially if you are crap at hitting stuff :)

Keep this up until you can afford a Viper, I think it's about 122k without calculating the trade in cost for your eagle + weapons, so it should be around 90k depending on what modules you have equiped on the Eagle.
**Remember,** always make sure you are left with enough money to pay the insurance in case you loose your ship or else you will have to start over with the sidewinder again!

Equip the Viper with 2 C2 Pulse and 2 C4 Pulse lasers, go back to Planet 2, now the AI should be melting like ice cream on a hot summer day. This is why i like the pulse laser, gimbaled lasers and guns are good but they are only effective below 1 km and often you need to get down to 800m and in PVP they are probably the better choice. Pulse lasers are effective up to around 3km and against the shit ships that the AI is flying in the ""Federation Distress Signal"" encounter their shield will go down in 2-4 bursts and 2-3 more to blow them to hell.

Now the money should be rolling in pretty fast and unless you screw up to many times by crashing into other ships or the dreadnought loosing your bounties you should be able to make around 250 to 300k in a couple of hours and it is time to switch ships again, unless you want to play it safe then go make 200k more.

Now we are going to buy the Lakon Type 6 which is a hauler. It is valued at around 240k so with the trade in for your old ship you should have plenty of money for insurance and to fill it with cargo, this is the part where we start making some serious cash but it is also the more tedious part imo.
The type 6 has 100 units of cargo space and a jump range of 30.31 light years (without cargo and mods) with the setup I'm running, 2 C2 missile launchers and 3 point defense turrets you should get around 15.5 ly jump range with a full cargo hold, this is more then enough for most runs.

Now go to [elitetradingtool.co.uk](http://www.elitetradingtool.co.uk/) which we will use to determine what cargo gives us the best profit according to where we are and how much money we have in our wallet.
For example, lets say we are in Eranin and have 60k to spare on cargo, i would recommend saving atleast 40k in the wallet in case you fuck up and loose the ship that will leave you enough money for insurance (10k without modules) and some cargo.

Use the trade calculator part and punch in how much cargo space and money you have and which system you are in. The page will give you what type of commodity you should buy and where you should sell it to make the maximum profit, the page is however not 100% accurate on the pricing at all times and sometimes you will earn a little bit less. Pro tip, sometimes the best paying system will be far away which requires many jumps and thus you might be better of selecting a system which pays less for your commodities but that you can reach within one jump.

Fuck this is getting long....

Repeat this part as many times as you like, remember to update your credit balance at elitetradingtool as you get richer because you can then buy larger amounts of more expensive commodities which in turn give you more profit, you will max out at around 110 to 150k profit per hauler run with the L6. You should now be making a good chunk of cash for every run an before you know it you have your first million, here is where the tedious part begins, we now want to upgrade to the L9 heavy hauler, which has a cargo space of 440 units but since it costs 3.5 mil we need to find a good short route which pays good money and keep grinding it, since you will only make around 120k per haul it takes a while to get to 3.5 mil and you also have to take into consideration that you need money for cargo and insurance.

This is how I made 3 mil in one weekend, I will grind an extra mil tonight and buy the L9, according to elite trading tool i should be able to make around 500k per haul the the L9.

Before i end this ridiculously long post let me mention the biggest risks when hauling.

1. Human factor. Hauling is boring as hell and after a couple of hours your mind starts to drift, that's when you usually forget to request for docking clearance or some other stupid shit which ends with your ship in pieces and your fist through your very expensive mechanical keyboard.

2. Interdiction. If you suck at this game and have no integrity as a gamer you will press escape and save and quit as soon as the interdiction message appears then you just rejoin and you will be floating in space by yourself all safe. I personally think this sucks and there will be a log off timer introduced sooner or later into Elite to deal with this kind of crap. I have had a lot of interdictions with my hauler and the way i deal with them has never lost me a ship. As soon as you see the interdiction message appear prepare because this need to be done fast. As soon as you drop out of supercruise divert all power to your engines and make sure you have full throttle set, immediately after this turn the flight assist off and punch the afterburner once or twice until you reach your maximum boost speed which is 350 m/s for the L6, since flight assist is turned off your ship will maintain it's maximum boost speed indefinitely, make sure you don't make any other control inputs during this time. As soon as you have reached maximum boost speed switch your power distribution to the shields just in case they start shooting at you. now just wait for you frameshift to come online and punch the J key to initiate supercruise again, at the moment i have fount this technique to be foolproof against the AI. REMEMBER TO ENGAGE FLIGHT ASSIST AGAIN ONCE YOU ARE AT YOUR DESTINATION :)

That was all, any suggestions for improving your profit are welcome :)

Excellent OP, and excellent discussion thus far. This is something that I, too, have pondered at length.

I think it's really quite simple, and mostly a matter of psychology. The fact that the world is a corrupt, wealth/power-siphoning machine in which we are violently abused and rendered powerless is **extremely** terrifying, and potentially traumatizing. Fear and powerlessness of such a scale is a very difficult thing for anyone to cope with, and our minds have numerous ways of dealing with it - most of them irrational, but very useful for our mental health.

Most people are simply stuck in the very initial phase of resistance to this terrible truth: denial - every human brain's go-to ""first line"" of defense (and rightly so; it's very good at its job). Those who have found their own denial to be insufficiently believable or pacifying, or who have broken through it in other ways, move to another psychic self-defense against what is essentially profound and unparalleled fear: false empowerment.

In our case, this false empowerment first re-asserts some agency or dominance: the terrified person is eager to feel that they have ""figured it out,"" and indeed, our brains love nothing more than collecting and connecting information into patterns, even when those patterns aren't real. The grand conspiracy theory allows a terrified, disempowered person to feel like they have a ""leg up"" on the conspirators, while injecting their self-esteem with an incredibly vital boost. That the conspiracy theory is unpopular, a ""secret,"" subject to misinformation by powerful entities, etc., serves well to make their privileged knowing all the more valuable, and make the theorist ""victorious"" against even greater odds. This is an unfortunate but very forgiveable position for a human to assume. In the absence of the right historical and/or class analysis, it's probably one of the only safe havens for such a mind to arrive at.

Unfortunately, because of its nature as a desperate (and incredibly important) psychic self-defense measure against utter despair and perceived impotence, this thoerizing must be cemented and shored up copiously, and the investment that people put into it very quickly grows immense. The conspiracy theory becomes the one thing that allows the person to retain some understanding or agency - and if not actual agency, then at least egoist superiority of some kind, compared to the ""sheeple."" Again, really quite forgiveable considering the circumstances - I would not declare myself or anyone I know to be immune from these incredibly powerful defenses within our minds (and I would further say that I'm grateful that they're there).

So what's missing, here? And where can such a mind go from that point of desperate, clinging defense of the ego? (note: ""ego"" has quite a tarnished reputation, these days, and I must clarify that I mean it in truly the broadest sense - one's sense of self as safe, good and empowered, mostly.)

Well, for one thing, we can provide an alternative source of understanding and agency. Replace the grand conspiracy with the simple truth about the [emergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence) results of hierarchical society and economy - what I've heard described as ""the un-spiracy."" Replace the deployment of [""cloud busters""](http://www.orgonite.info/how-to-make-chembusters.html) and Zeitgeist screenings (okay, maybe the latter aren't the *worst* idea) with on-the-ground organizing, community and workplace projects, direct action etc. Really, with the typically more social component, these sources of agency are much more effective at supporting mental health, anyway.

The problem is, again, that conspiracy theories placate some of the most very basic, **primal** parts of our mind, and this form of defense must, by its very nature, be **extremely** resilient. Breaking through it might be comparable to how some mental health professionals struggle to tear down the similarly self-defensive conceptions of some of their patients (whether those conceptions are worthy of such destruction or not) - sometimes for decades without success. As to how to go about doing that, I have no specific tips, just general guesswork:

* Education is almost never a bad thing, and may provide the framework for a more rational, class/race/gender/etc-based socioeconomic analysis. The emergence principles that I linked above can also be a useful tool for showing how some very intricate and ""inexplicable"" patterns can emerge from a field with just a few very simple rules, just like water molecules arranging themselves into snowflakes.

* Welcome and social acceptance might be the most important thing of all. Social drives are perhaps the most powerful that our minds possess, and giving someone the opportunity to join and participate in a community that truly cares about them can overcome almost any other situation which does not offer those things. Our modern anarcho-habits of talking shit on everyone, machismo et al are not doing us favors, here, but I wouldn't claim to know their value or motives to those engaging in them (and I do it, too - though I try not to).

* Participatory, empowering action could be just as vital. There are so few footholds to gain a sense of real agency and empowerment in this overwhelming shithole of a societal ""order"" that a well-executed direct action, or even a simple radical newspaper, can be an absolute game-changer in terms of how a person copes with the awfulness. I think it's this action-based empowerment, as well as the social supports as just mentioned, that have allowed the Occupy movement (and really, most movements) to have a remarkable legacy of people still dedicated to activism when they had never considered it before getting involved.

* Let's **support** each other! Our dominant culture is one of subtle social dominance games and individual isolation, and in many of our little circle-a scenes we haven't gotten as far from that as we might like. People turn to conspiracy theories, in my analysis, because they have real, legitimate needs in order to sustain their mental well-being. We all have such needs! Let's embrace those needs, and each other, and form communities that are honest, caring, welcoming even to those who believe differently, and understand that we don't just ""want"" the people we know to support us - but **need** them to!

TL;DR: To ""convert"" a conspiracy theorist, offer them an analysis that doesn't need a conspiracy, stroke their ego, give them an outlet to be empowered, and offer social welcome and support.",3,sapiophile,True,t3_2ei2lc,0,cjzxpo8,0,1427368099,

It was the age of empires my friend every empire spread by the sword. 

The Jizyah was actually set to be less than the equivalent Byzantine tax. Islam spread through numerous Christian regions particularly the Levant. Sorry about the cut and paste job but its an important paragraph.

*At the time, the Umayyad taxation and administrative practice were perceived as unjust by some Muslims. While the non-Muslim population had autonomy, their judicial matters were dealt with in accordance with their own laws and by their own religious heads or their appointees.[8] They paid a poll tax for policing to the central state.[8] Muhammad had stated explicitly during his lifetime that each religious minority should be allowed to practice its own religion and govern itself, and the policy had on the whole continued.[8] The welfare state for both the Muslim and the non-Muslim poor started by Omar had also continued.[8][8] Muawiya's wife Maysum (Yazid's mother) was also a Christian. The relations between the Muslims and the Christians in the state were good. The Umayyads were involved in frequent battles with the Christian Byzantines without being concerned with protecting their rear in Syria,[8] which had remained largely Christian like many other parts of the empire.[8][8] Prominent positions were held by Christians, some of whom belonged to families that had served in Byzantine governments. The employment of Christians was part of a broader policy of religious tolerance that was necessitated by the presence of large Christian populations in the conquered provinces, especially in Syria. This policy also boosted his popularity and solidified Syria as his power base.[9][10]*

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_Caliphate


So while there was a tax for Christians and Jews it was no more than the existing taxes they had to pay and in return for that tax their children didn't need to serve in the military, the  non muslim confessional communities lived in their own millets, built their own churches, collected their own taxes and ruled according to their own religious code. It was actually Muslims that felt hard done by. While treatment did vary from caliph to caliph, its fair to say that non Muslims in the muslim lands were protected from the schisms that took place later on in christianity which led to bloodbaths for hundreds of years. Jews were also generally treated better than under Christian rule.

&gt;Obama claimed to close loop holes but he never has and will not specify which loop holes he closed

He did specify which loop holes he wants closed and has pushed for it to happen multiple times but he needs action from congress which just is not going to happen. Unfortunately, Obama has to depend on the congress to write the laws for him to sign. Its unfortunate that we have to depend on the congresspeople who have explicitly said they want to see our government fail at the cost of president obama.

Lets take one easy example: Obamas stimulus package.

You can make the argument that no president in history has done more for small business than what the stimulus package did. He gave over $200 billion dollars back to the taxpayers to spend in the local economy. You could argue that it saved the national economy from certain doom by putting over 6 million people back to work around the country. At a time when all small businesses were just trying to make ends meet, this gave a straight boost to revenue across the board to all small business.

Obama also made it much easier to get start up government back SBA loans. He increased the amount they would back and made it much easier to apply for the loans.

Source: http://www.sba.gov/blogs/president-obamas-budget-priorities-small-businesses

He cut taxes on small business by himself or renewed legislation to continue tax cuts 18 times.

He gave incentives to small businesses to hire veterans, particularly disabled veterans.

Here is something explicitly done by the administration to help smaller businesses collect from larger businesses. He just proposed this last month.
&gt;The President’s QuickPay initiative has strengthened small contractors working with Federal Government, cutting in half the time it takes to get paid, reaching 172,000 small businesses, covering $220 billion in contract awards, and generating well over $1 billion for small businesses – freeing up capital to invest and hire new workers.

I'm pretty sure you won't meet many people who will say the first thing they think of when you mention Arin are either of those. 
Part of the issue in acknowledging that people like it is due to Ego's massive reputation and fan following prior to the production of both. There's something I refer to as Associative Creator Interest, which is basically what occurs when two entities of fame and fandom meet to collaborate. In theory, since the end product is a creation of both entities and features concepts that both are known for, it will be enjoyed by the collective whole. However, since it is possible for the two entities to be of differentiating popularity, the fans that each side will attract will be uneven. Going from this, there is then a disproportionate number of respective fans that will be exposed to and most likely subscribe to the entity of the other. NSP's popularity was modest, but relatively low in comparison to Egoraptor and JonTronShow. ACI boosted his subscriber count significantly after he joined the GG group. 

Arin's popularity has reached cult status from his followers. His on screen persona is loud, in charge, and commanding, reinforcing the atmosphere of absolute obedience and inability to question his opinions, even if it's a joke. It is possible his real personality reflects this as well.

The point I'm attempting to make is that these derivative content shows/products can be of lower quality than the parent franchise and still be accepted because of their origins. It's the same as Skyward Sword's assigned role in the Zelda Sequelitist. Arin proclaims that because of its parents' reputation, it needs to make no effort to innovate and maintain quality because it rides on the success of past ideas. I think this is bad, and I think Arin is a bad person for encouraging/allowing/tolerating this. It doesn't matter if it's his idea, Suzy's or Polaris'.

He soon found what he was looking for: bright, white plastic boxes, each about the size of a brick, some with little antennas sticking out. Mr. Smith pulled a laptop from his backpack and got to work, tending to the nodes of the Red Hook mesh, an ambitious plan to link up a local wireless digital network across the neighborhood.

With the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway just ahead and the Lower Manhattan skyline in the distance, Mr. Smith worked on keeping the digital conversation going. He was examining two devices on the roof while wirelessly conversing with a minicomputer a few hundred feet away on the roof of a school that had a high-speed Internet connection.

Though these white boxes, spread across various rooftops in Red Hook, may appear haphazard, or guerrilla even, the Red Hook mesh is actually in the vanguard of wireless networking. Unlike the Internet available at work or at home, which typically arrives through a wire and follows a carefully plotted path from Internet provider to user, a mesh network is improvised — and remarkably resilient.

Because the devices speak to one another, they are more than a series of “hot spots” with Internet access; the mesh remains a network whether or not it is connected to the Internet. And that independence is its main attraction — in Berlin, where a tech collective shares Internet access to save money; in rural Spain, where one of the largest mesh networks covers areas ignored by telecoms; in Tunisia, where the State Department has spent millions establishing a mesh network to experiment with a local network impervious to government censorship.

Red Hook, which juts out of Brooklyn into New York Bay and is cut off from the rest of the borough by the B.Q.E., has similar reasons for hosting a mesh. The 11,000 or so residents can feel at the whim of nature, as well as government and corporate bureaucracies. There is no subway service; there are few Internet hot spots; close to 70 percent of the population lives in New York City housing projects.

When Hurricane Sandy struck in 2012, Red Hook was especially exposed. Cellphone service was down and Internet service was spotty. The lights were out. Water rushed through the streets.

After the storm, the divisions between the homeowners and the housing project residents were irrelevant, said Anthony Schloss, who helped create the mesh network through his work at Red Hook Initiative, a nonprofit group. The initiative trains young residents like Mr. Smith to become “digital stewards.” Each steward works 20 hours a week (and is paid $8.75 an hour) as part of a yearlong program that teaches skills including mesh networking, video production and web design, culminating in an internship. One steward now works at Sky-Packets, a mesh networking company on Long Island; another is with Pioneer Works, a Red Hook arts center.

Though the mesh was in the works before Hurricane Sandy struck, it gained added relevance after the storm. The Federal Emergency Management Agency boosted the Red Hook Initiative’s broadband connection, so where the regular Internet was unavailable, residents and government workers could log on to the mesh to quickly find out where to pick up supplies or find government officials.

Although the Red Hook mesh promises a free web connection, its potential for intensely local communication also appeals to Mr. Schloss and Mr. Smith. “That’s our hope, that the network is used as a source of communication throughout the neighborhood,” Mr. Smith said, adding, “We want to have both, that second layer, so if the Internet goes down we can still connect with each other through the mesh.”

Joshua Breitbart, a senior fellow at New America Foundation’s Open Technology Institute, which created the software that helps the Red Hook mesh operate, said digital culture was too focused on the global, as opposed to the local. “The general narrative of Silicon Valley is, build an app and change the world,” Mr. Breitbart said. “There should be room to say, ‘Build an app and change my neighborhood.’ ”

Mr. Smith, who grew up and lives in the Red Hook Houses, is a very different kind of network administrator. Last year, he was one of 10 or so digital stewards. While other stewards left for jobs with a tech bent, Mr. Smith, a soft-spoken young man seemingly happy with his head bent over a laptop reading technical protocols, stayed to train the next class. He is now in charge of maintaining the mesh.

Mr. Smith has a complicated set of responsibilities, requiring technical, installation and political skills — after all, these nodes are on somebody’s roof. Add in that the Red Hook mesh is using very cheap equipment, and it is the rare day when the entire network is humming in sync. When Mr. Smith was on the roof of the Miccio center, some nodes were working, some were not. Which is the way it usually goes.

“We need to get one area where the Internet is great,” he said, “and have people talking about it — like FiOS.”

A crucial point in the Red Hook mesh is Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary Roman Catholic Church — particularly its bell tower, which looms over the neighborhood and Coffey Park below it. The church, which is more than 150 years old and began by serving Irish and Italian dockworkers, has three mesh nodes, two high up, and one inside for internal use.

That internal node has helped the church play videos during its religious education classes and host a radio station that broadcasts its Sunday Mass, said Robert Berrios, the sacristan of the church, who has lived in Red Hook for 45 years.

But the outward-facing nodes have also drawn a crowd, he said. “I see people outside to get free Wi-Fi,” he said. “Either with an iPad, a tablet or a phone — people sitting in their cars writing emails.”

This summer, the Red Hook mesh has been fighting to remain relevant, hurt by spotty service and lack of awareness. The Red Hook Initiative is completing an upgrade of the equipment and software, and is working on raising awareness in the community.
Continue reading the main story Continue reading the main story

To that end, the group is a finalist for an Economic Development Corporation grant for nearly $1 million. The group hopes to uses the money to buy more sophisticated nodes to support the network.

The local content at the mesh appears on a splash page after you log in. Among the early experiments was a stop-and-frisk app, which would allow Red Hook residents to easily report their experiences with the police. But three weeks after the app was introduced, Mr. Schloss said, the Police Department discontinued the policy.

The protests in Ferguson, Mo., have engaged the digital stewards, said Jaebi Bussey, 34, a trainer at the initiative.

Staying with the idea of monitoring law enforcement, the group has plans to meet with the creators of an online project, Copwatch, to see how their skills — in using social media, in creating and uploading videos — could be used to track police conduct in the neighborhood. With more reliable Wi-Fi service, introducing new local apps should become easier. But Mr. Schloss counts the benefits already in place. Digital expertise coming from the stewards, all residents of the Red Hook Houses, sends an important message.

“If this works,” he said, “you have this virtual platform, this virtual community that everyone can be interacting with, devoid of all the cultural assumptions. And if you flip it, and the people who build it and are maintaining it are young people from public housing, that totally changes the way people think about each other and what technology can be.”

Shortly after taking over the party's main disciplinary agency, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, in late 2012, he required his staff to read Alexis de Tocqueville's history of the French Revolution and had them write up their views on why the monarchy fell, according to Chinese officials, a reminder of the stakes involved in efforts to revitalize the party.

The goal, he told his associates, is to make sure that party members ""don't want to be corrupt, can't be corrupt and dare not commit corruption,"" according to the officials.

Other Chinese anticorruption drives have petered out after bagging one or two officials. But Mr. Wang has sought to institutionalize this one, requiring local investigators to report their findings to his office in Beijing as well as to local authorities, so the investigations won't be quashed locally, say Chinese officials. He also relies on public resentment to fuel his work, starting a Web-based hotline for complaints.

Mr. Wang has fielded a dozen investigatory groups and fanned them out around the country. Many are headed by a retired official of ministerial rank who hails from provinces outside the one being inspected.

In Shanghai, his investigators settled in at prestigious Fudan University in late May. They installed mailboxes in the university's campus for tips and collected nearly 2,000 within a month, according to people with knowledge of the effort. Three months later, Mr. Wang's agency criticized Fudan for lax oversight of research funds and referred evidence of corruption to government investigators for follow-up.

Fudan officials declined to comment. But in a statement posted on its website, the university said it is in the process of addressing the problems uncovered by Mr. Wang's team. The government hasn't taken further actions.

In rural Guizhou province in southwest China, local party officials who said they were influenced by national efforts chose a different tactic. In a kind of Chinese version of ""Scared Straight,"" the U.S. program in which teenagers are taken into prisons to see the lives of convicted criminals, a local prison in the city of Kaili now opens its gates to local party officials so they can meet people who were jailed for corruption.

The climax of the program is a show staged by prisoners who sing plaintively about how they ruined their lives by their greed, say two Kaili hospital officials who viewed the performances. ""It was touching,"" said one of the officials. ""A lot of people cried."" Kaili prison officials wouldn't comment on the program, which is now being replicated by a Beijing ministry, according to Mr. Wang's agency.

Mr. Wang's teams are also expanding efforts to comb through financial records domestically and abroad to look for hidden assets and other evidence of wrongdoing. Recently, he formed a new department to work with foreign governments to hunt down corrupt Chinese officials overseas.

Mr. Wang, square-jawed with a trademark comb-over, is called ""the fireman"" by the Chinese media for his long career of handling emergencies. His fans have posted messages on social media sites likening him to Justice Bao, a Song Dynasty official who became a symbol of justice because of his willingness to punish powerful people guilty of crimes. They also routinely note that Mr. Wang, who is married, is childless, and thus, by local logic, has less incentive to steal to enrich his family. 

In the late 1990s, Mr. Wang was put in charge of handling China's largest bankruptcy, which involved facing down angry foreign creditors. In 2003, he was summoned to Beijing to stem the spread of the severe-acute-respiratory syndrome, or SARS, epidemic there. He helped contain panic by having state television film his walks to markets and hospitals. Then, as Beijing mayor, he helped organize the 2008 Olympics.

Promoted to vice-premier in charge of economic relations in 2008, he assured the U.S. and Europe that China would continue to buy their bonds during the global financial crisis, an important confidence-boosting measure. U.S. officials also credit him with convincing senior Chinese leaders to let the yuan start to float somewhat, beginning in June 2010, a longtime U.S. aim.

He continues to meet with top U.S. and international economic officials in what Mr. Wang calls ""old friends"" sessions. The rules: no ties, few aides and discussions about the broad contours of the global economy, say those involved. He also sometimes uses the time to explain the anticorruption drive, which some U.S. officials worry could derail the Chinese economy if not handled adroitly.

Dealing with him can be maddening, say Western officials, because of his sharp tongue and high-handedness. During one meeting with European business leaders during the financial crisis, he told them their complaints didn't make much difference because he knew they would invest in China anyway, says a participant in the meeting.

Mr. Wang has also made clear in public remarks to party officials that he considers the crackdown a temporary expedient until China figures out a way to improve its investigatory and legal system. For now, though, he and his investigators continue to focus on individual cases of graft.

One of the cases centered on the partial sale in 2009 of a large, state-owned enterprise, Nanchang Steel Co., and the man who oversaw it, Su Rong, until recently a vice chairman of China's top advisory body and former party secretary of Jiangxi Province, where the mill is based. The sale—for nearly 60% of the company to a manufacturer run by a local billionaire—was lauded in the local media as a reform measure because it opened the sector to private capital. But some of the steel company's employees suspected wrongdoing.

They stood in line to see Mr. Wang's investigators and shared evidence that Mr. Su and his allies rigged the bidding process in favor of the manufacturer, in exchange for kickbacks, according to several of the employees and province officials with knowledge of the matter.

Mr. Wang's agency found enough evidence to place the 66-year-old Mr. Su under investigation in June for suspicion of violating party rules and state laws, say officials close to Mr. Wang's agency—Chinese code words for suspected graft. The political advisory body also fired him from his vice chairman post. The anticorruption drive felled the billionaire too, who, while not being charged, was fired as representative to China's parliament.

Although no charges have been filed against Mr. Su, he hasn't been seen in public since June 10 and couldn't be reached for comment. ""Wang Qishan really means business,"" says Yang Peng, the restaurateur who informed on Mr. Su to Mr. Wang's team. ""I celebrated that with fireworks on the day when Su Rong's investigation was announced.""",1,Bennelong,True,t3_2ed6ei,0,cjybrx6,0,1427395602,

It's a mixed bag really. There are many aspects that come into play and most of them are derived from the settings, controls, and pace of the game. 

In the earlier games (as you've already said) the controls are difficult and ""tanked."" With these controls the game is much more difficult and it takes a bit more effort not to get hit and/or die. Personally, this makes that game feel more tense and builds on the claustrophobic settings. All around, this makes the game scarier because you don't know if the next zombie will end you or if you'll be able to dodge it or if you'll have enough ammo to take it down (inventory is another aspect that added to the intensity, mostly due to the lack of extra ammo... that shit didn't just fall out of enemies and there weren't bonus point stat boosts). 

In the newer games (also as you've already said) the controls are much more of an action/adventure game. You're not the only one that finds them humorous. That all started in RE4 when they switched to 3rd person view. The difference in 4 and 5-6 however is the settings and pacing. 4 is much more dark and ominous. However, the change in pace is accelerated compared to that of the predecessors (1-3). In RE4 (and some of 3) everything went from *explore this section/area and collect things in order to progress to the next area* to *kill a bunch of zombiefied/parasite infested NPC's to get a key that you will then use on the door to the left, rinse and repeat ad infinitum until you reach the end.* Rationing ammo isn't really necessary. Getting hit doesn't really cause strife because there are always herbs/FA sprays and guess what... they pop up when you kill almost any enemy. This makes for easier gameplay and less intensity which was filled with endless swarms of enemies.

The divergence amongst fans comes from the newer games being of the action genre. I'm sure there are many that like the game based on liking the genre but there are also that don't because the genre is trite and overused. Especially for a game that has always boasted survival horror. They have shifted from that to just survival. Almost all of the horror is gone from the newer games and what is left is just stuff that jumps out at you from corners or steam-rolls you with massive numbers/size. Since RE6 came out there has been a lot of talk about pandering to a wider audience by making the games easier and more action packed, fast paced, high impact. And honestly, I agree.

You don't have much money so you can't buy really nice stuff and let them have their fun. You can always use money cheats or cheats for their needs, or you can focus on buying better objects whenever you can. 

I always have my sims cook their own individual meals so their cooking will go up because they're cooking all the time. Doing laundry will give them a mood boost. The first nice objects I try to buy are beds, friges and stoves. And then showers come after that. Nicer quality stuff won't give you negative moodlets and they will break down less which will be less annoying/stressful for you and your sims.

Once the 2nd generation comes alone, and especially the third, you will have collected a lot of nice objects so that should help. This might be part of the reason why you see so many people with stable families.

Also when you start your second generation you get to start toddlers on their skills earlier and send them to boarding school so you get a jump start on a career. Or send them to school and get a bit of a start to a career.

I'm really terrible at playing with households with more than 2 or 3 people. Maybe you're better at smaller families, or just need to practice with smaller families?

and has a lot of guides on what to fish, where, and how to do it for beginners.

essentially, fishing changed a while ago so that you'll always catch something. however, once you get to say, 100, the actual fish catching should start to become more reliable, but the skill-up will decrease.

each zone has a recommended fishing level, which ensures a reliable catch rate. main cities, thats around 40 from memory, so the first few are a little rough, but relatively easy.

in the starter zones, i.e. level 5-10 mobs, that goes up to 90. from there, each zone usually jumps by 30-40 points, so you reach the same or similar profession scale as other professions.

if you start off in a capital city's fishing area, you should be starting to catch fish 4/5 to 9/10 times once you hit 80-90 in fishing.

after you reach that 'peak' level, the quality / skill drops, so you don't get as much of a profession skill-up from the same pool. however, unlike anywhere else in the game, you can perfectly well spend 100 hours in a main city, fishing all the way to your level cap (200 at 35, 350 at 50, etc.) or all the way to the profession cap at 600.

after 600, things get a bit wierd.

Open oceans are usually higher skill rating than the regular rivers, so an ocean part that won't lead to 'fatigue' is difficult (finding islands that are located on the edge between ""water"" and ""ocean""). open ocean in pandaria is around 700 skill, so you need to equip fishing poles / hats / rings / buffs, and all sorts of buffs that can be collected to improve the drop rate of fish to junk catches.

Pool fishing, where you find a ""spawn"" point in the water, when you hover over it, fishing from a pool is usually a 80-100% chance of catching that fish. pool fishing is far more reliable, and usually faster than regular fishing, and is the only way to gather particular types for cooking or alchemy use (or more likely now, pandaria cooking tokens in exchange for better cooking food types)

if you are at 90, you can skip a lot of work by completing ben's fishing tasks at halfhill, and he'll boost your fishing level with a few quests to catch the golden carp. 

There's also the Anglers profession which will give you 3-5 fishing skillups per day and 50-80 gold just for doing a few quests, with a mount and pet reward from nat pagle (master fisherman...)

along with archaeology, fishing is a time-sink profession. it is not as glamorous or as popular as gathering or crafting professions, and the rewards are very limited. 

if you want to make money from fishing, find the fish of the day pool in pandaria and spend an hour, fishing those up as there's usually a swarm of 30 fishing pools for that day, sell them for 2g or so each (40g a stack) the day after the pool has expired on the AH, possibly more if the average price is higher. 

in terms of the fishing minigame in wow, 

there's the weekend fishing competitions in kaluak/northrend on saturdays, and the booty bay competition on sunday. the winners are usually those who can prepare for the competition, and have more luck at catching the fish first, usually by griefing others.

a handful of rare fish, in alliance and horde cities, the catch rate is 0.002%, give or take,

the sea turtle mount in cataclysm/pandaria pools

The dividends paid over the 3-4 years before 2007 don't nearly make up for the stock price getting chopped down to less than 1/3 of what it was. You can look at the earnings statements. They don't make up for the $75 billion that BAC has paid to the government already in fines.

You are right that this settlement is bullshit, as Holder is just using it as a stepping stone to boost his career, he is not going after anybody that can fight back. The fine is being paid by people who had nothing to do with the fraud, and none of the money is going to the people who were hurt by the fraud. The main people who profited were the previous management team that took in large bonuses and dumped their equity compensation before the shit hit the fan. They are doing fine. Some of them, like Treasury Secretary Jack Lew who ran Citi, went on to other very high positions of power.

Note that when the previous management were committing the mortgage fraud, they cared about enriching themselves, not the bank. When they push $100 million in toxic mortgages, they collect maybe $1 million in fees. It's a middle-man transaction where they collect a small fee. And some of those fees go into their bonus. That is very little money for BAC, but a lot of shitty mortgages that are sold. So some guy who wanted an extra $100k in bonus would end up doing $100 million in damage. That is why the crisis ended up being so severe.

At the moment, bank shareholders know that paying the government is the cost of doing business. The statute of limitations is running out on these loans, and Holder wants to make his point. So the banks have to pay to make it go away, even though everybody knows it is a bullshit deal. The shareholders know it too, but they are not stupid enough to fight the government.

Satisfy your daily pixel-induced fix by blowing up your enemies with an arsenal of weapons the US Army would be jealous of. Set traps, disable, and boost your way to safety with tight controls that keep you in control. Show off your skills in style mode, or go brute force in arcade; then, settle down for a tense romp through desolate space while avoiding active mines. Did we mention Shwip has global leaderboards and local multiplayer? Compete against friends or random internet strangers and reach for the top, soldier. 

**Progress**

[you can download the beta here:](http://jamhammer.ca/downloads/shwipbeta1001.zip)

We just launched our public arcade mode beta test. Shwip will have 4 main modes, along with accompanying local multi-player. The beta features only one mode, and we are currently collecting stats and feedback from our players. If you'd like to give our shmup a try.

After we implement feedback from our Beta, we'll go on to complete the other modes. You can read about those modes on either our site, or greenlight.

1. [S3r1ous Modpack](http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?resources/s3r1ous-mods.1358/) is relatively popular, and provides its own list of generally compatible, well-put together mods. Get it all or nit-pick those that suit your play. Wulf's mods are included in there! What's awesome is the author keeps it constantly updated, making sure all mods work well with one another. I personally have this one activated at all times. If I were you I'd check this out for a good list of mods.

2. A couple big race mods out there: [the avali race is very unique, and I'd argue it really changes gameplay](http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?resources/avali-race-mod.998/); [the peglaci race are also quite fascinating, and host additional, hi-tech weaponry and assets](http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?resources/the-peglaci.1768/). Both offer new furniture, crafting stations, weaponry, lore, etc. Worth looking into. 

3. A relatively small but useful mod, [hydrophobia fix](http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?resources/hydrophobia-fix.2187/) will make sure that water won't wash away certain furniture, like furnaces and fireplaces. Of course, torches and campfires are still subject to erasure.

What it does though is damage all mobs within a certain distance of the ritual stone (10 blocks?) and generate LP in the nearby altar. You'll just want to setup some cursed earth platforms underneath it with vacuum hoppers pumping out the items. You can't get rare drops though.

A potential alternative that I've never tried but might work is have them be killed by a activator with a dagger of sacrifice, you'd need that to be within a block or two of the altar though so it won't look pretty likely.

**Legacy cards behind a giant paywall - 5/10** 

- There are three, but essentially two formats to the game, Open and Standard. You can play all the legacy cards banned out in Standard in Open format.
- These cards unfortunately sit behind a paywall. You can't consistently acquire these with in game currency.
- A big low blow to anyone bored of Standard play and just want to goof around with bullshit.

I would rank this lower if it wasn't for tournaments. Open and (generally) Weekly format allow these Legacy cards. Since you can't buy these legacy boosters, this isolates an entire player base. Fortunately the tournaments available aren't too big of a deal. It's mainly the fact that they actually put these behind a paywall when there are achievements available that's inexcusable.

---
**Economy/Market 8/10**

&gt;Scummy monetization strategy (not upfront about the mandatory nature of the booster packs to get all the cards, almost certainly would be forced to buy additional boosters to continue playing once new content is added)

- Pay wall or play wall as I'll call it. You essentially only get cards by buying booster packs.
- Currency rate feels slow. There's daily quests to help get gold, but I personally don't think it's enough when there's just way too much to collect (some decks rely on 4x the same card, imagine opening packs trying to grab 3-4 of any single rare card in Hearthstone. That's what it feels like sometimes)
- Can feel like a grind if you lack options. You need cards to try out newer decks, but you lack the gold to buy new cards. Ubi doesn't seem to want to give in this department for daily players.
- No card trading/auctioning. I can't refine cards to the Hearthstone equivalent of dust, Wildcards. You essentially sell it for low amounts of Gold.
- Rate of acquiring Wild Cards feels slow. You need to get to a high enough rank to get Wildcard quests, and you have to get lucky to get Wildcard quest in the first place. Assuming best case scenario, you get about 1 Rare/Epic card a week.
- Shitty real money conversion rates


It just feels slow. I don't have hard stats and numbers, but in my experience it feels slower then it should be for a game with so many cards.

---
**Bugs 7/10**

The worst bug you can get is the game crashing the middle of a tournament. Otherwise most of the time the game crashes and you move on.

EDIT: Bumped this up to 7/10. Someone did point out there issues, and lately I've had a lot of client crashes. Thankfully most of these have been outside of actual games but throwing that out there.

---
**Balance (?)**

At the current moment, at higher MMR almost every faction has something playable. So the meta is pretty good for now compared to before. Right now there are standouts for being arguably too strong, but we'll have to see how Ubi chooses to balance things out. I'll go ahead and say right now, almost no card is imba in Standard play imo. If you were to think a card is broken, it's either not or just really strong.

&gt;but 30 minute games can be a real fun killer when facing certain 'non interactive' opponents (One turn kill, etc).

Games aren't usually 30 minutes. 6-10 minutes average maybe with a few spikes in the 15+ if the game is real close. There is currently one bullshit OTK deck in standard, and the non-interactive decks are really niche, rare and still beatable.

Here are the basics:

---

weekly:

 * penguins, find all the penguins each penguins gives you experience compared to 2-3 magic lamps (25* your level per point), use ""world60pengs"" friend chat to help you look.
 * tears of guthix, gives a big chunck in your lowest skill depending on how much blue tears you collect, requires completion of the quest off the ame name.
 * circus, you perform some acts in a circus, get lots of exp in magic/ranged/agility(/thieving/firemaking require quests) no crafting unfortunatly but it only takes 5mins and you'll get cool costumes.

---

monthly:

 * troll invasion: defend burthope against some trolls, gives a lot of exp in a skill of your choice (maybe read a guide about it as it can be confusing the first time)
 * god statues: lots of construction and either prayer or slayer exp by building 4 statues in 4 different places, you also get a chisel which boost your construction +1, also takes like 5 minutes.

---

Others worth mentioning:

 * phoenix lair is one that gives you 1000 crafting exp daily and some other exp, but the bg prze is a phoenix pet which is extremelly rare.
 * warbands, it's fairly complicated and is ussually done in teams, it is in wilderniss so don't risk anything you can't afford to lose, but if done corectly it can reward you for over 200k exp each day (no crafting though).
 * bork/skeletal horror, require quests and can be killed daily afterwards,  bork is really nice for charms and gems which can be boosted trough various tasks, horror gives some exp and both have decent clue scroll drop chances.

I don't know much about jungle, but most of the time any of the heroes I've tried have been able to handle the easy mercs around 5+ and hard around 10+ once I have my ult.

Last hitting is dead. No more. It has ceased to be. Regardless of if it you that killed it or another person on the team it counts for you. You only see the XP that you get though.

That fountain is what the other team can use to heal some. If you look you have one too. When you r-click it you'll heal some and get a debuff that says how long you have to wait to use it again.

Kill everything in lane until a map objective shows up. Each map is different. 

Dragon Shrine you'll want to capture the two shrines. One is north and the other is south. If your team holds both one player can go to the statue in the middle and turn into a dragon knight and wreck face.

Blackheart's Bay you'll want to kill the chests/mercs for coins that you can give to the pirate in the middle so he'll fire the cannons at the enemy team's fortifications.

Haunted Mines you'll want to kill minions in the mines when they open and collect the skulls. Once all the skulls have been collected golems will spawn for both teams. The more skulls a team has the stronger their golem will be. Once the golems die the spot they die is where they will spawn so you want to keep the other team's golem back and help yours push forward.

Cursed Raven Map (cause I don't remember the name) you'll want to collect the tributes that spawn in either the north or south of the map. Seriously, if you are south and one spawns north book it north for that thing. Once a team collects three the other team will be cursed. The minions will all have 1HP and the towers won't shoot for a while.

Garden of Terror you'll do normal fighting until the night phase. At night plant mobs spawn. Kill them and collect the seeds. Once all the seeds are collected it'll be day time again. Once a team has 100 seeds one of the players can click a plant near your base to become a plant terror that can polymorph enemies and drop a vine that can put some big hurt on fortifications.

I highly recommend making the most of Practice and Cooperative and trying out as many heroes as possible. In the shop you can try out each hero with extra controls that let you boost the levels and reset everything in the test so you can get a good feel for things. Once you find a hero you like to play that's the one you should go for. Early on you get gold pretty quickly and easily, it's just later that it slows to a crawl so don't worry too much about it yet. You don't unlock all of a hero's talents until level 4 so if you want maximum options for Versus it's best to wait till you level a hero up. It's quick though. 3-4 games approximately. Practice is the easiest too. You can actually AFK practice games and the 4 bots on your team will almost always beat the 5 enemy bots.

The more doge burned, the worse Dogecoin's inflation rate will be.

On the other hand, one can argue that the less supply there is, the more value there may be for Dogecoin (assuming demand is the same). Also, Dogeparty can help boost Dogecoin's network security and may increase utility in Dogecoin, so Dogeparty may actually be worth the increase of inflation rate. But this is still speculation, as Dogeparty is less than a week old.

Also, while there are Dogecoin burned, it might not really mean anything since in Dogecoin's blockchain, the burned Dogecoin is still considered in circulation. Satoshi Nakamoto has collected an abundant amount of Bitcoins, yet s/he never used them (is it lost?). Yet Bitcoin blockchain still sees Satoshi's Bitcoins as part of its circulation.

* More themes that actually make a difference to gameplay, maybe certain themes that unlocks the ability to buy more of certain upgrades. or show special collectibles you can only get while using that theme, or unlock secret upgrades that can only be seen and upgraded if you have that theme selected.  

* Many different thinks every 5-10 levels in the vortex to make it less of a chore.

0,,t1_cjvlb8l,1,1408548238,,t1_cjvk2fa,1408559390,politics,False,,t5_2cneq,"Hi, thanks for responding! Good points all around, so thanks for adding to the discussion :)

&gt;Maybe ""principle"" isn't the best way to govern the lives of millions of people.  Principle just means your mind is set.  It assumes you know everything and nothing changes.  It is literally the worst thing to base any decision on.  Maybe you should try thought, reason and logic.

Good point, but I disagree! To me, principle is adhering to a set of standards that are important enough not to break. For example, respecting the Constitution is a matter of principle to me, or voting every election is also a matter of principle. It's things which are important enough to defend as much as possible. You made the excellent request to use thought, reason, and logic, so I'll do that here. If it's not good enough, let me know! I haven't had my coffee yet, so be gentle :p

Here goes: Central and Eastern Massachusetts are the main focus of the state government, while Western Massachusetts (anything west of Worcester) is ignored. The gas tax disproportionately harms Western MA more than Eastern and  Central MA. Using logic, I can deduce this by the following reasoning: Western MA lacks public transportation, and is more depressed than Central and Eastern MA. I can reason this because looking at any map of GDP by county or town, Western Mass comes at the bottom of the ladder, collectively. Eastern and Central Mass have several options for public transportation (buses, commuter rail, subway, taxi services, bike sharing programs), while Western Mass lacks these options. 

Therefore, using reasoning, we can infer Western Mass relies more on their cars for work than Eastern or Central Mass, due to the lack of public transpiration options. Because of this, we can see this legislation is effecting one part of the state populace, more than another, which doesn't seem fair, especially when you consider the Massachusetts government does not pay attention to Western Mass at all. 

A second point is that some necessary goods, like taxes, shouldn't be tied to inflation because the state legislator should vote on raising, lowering, or maintaining the current tax level of said tax. This ensures that we can connect the tax to the current economic state of Massachusetts, whatever it may be, and see if the tax level makes sense. 

Remember that the position held is not one against taxing gas, but one that suggests the tie to inflation should not exist, and that other measures can be taken to increase revenue for road services (which I will logically discuss soon). 

&gt;Really, why spend all the time and money writing legislation, voting on it, passing it and implementing it just once when you can spend that money again and again every year.  Really fiscally conservative of you.  If you need ""x"" amount of money from the gas tax this year, you are going to need as much or more next year and if you don't adjust the amount for inflation, you have less the next year.  

Good point, however, this is not an advocation for voting on the measure yearly. It's a proposal to vote on it every few years. If that wasn't clear, I apologize! Obviously you can't vote on everything on a yearly basis, but it is fiscally conservative to vote on a tax again every few years (5-10), to make sure the state populace agrees with it. Again, we can do other things to raise revenue than have the gas tax.

&gt;Seems like your ""principle"" isn't to firmly rooted in how the world actually works.

Inflation exists. Other measures to pay for the roads exist. You're suggesting this is a false, meaning that there aren't other ways to pay for the roads, which there clearly are. This is illogical for you to think when there's so much evidence to the contrary. 

&gt;Legalizing weed doesn't raise revenue unless you tax it.  Gambling doesn't raise money unless you tax it.  Changing tax structures don't increase revenue unless someone starts paying more. 

Yes! Do all of this things! This is why your position is illogical: you say our ideas are not rooted in reality, but then you point out the other solutions some of us support. You yourself might be against those things, but we think they can raise revenue fairly. Let's tackle this logically, like you requested. 

Marijuana is currently illegal in the state of Massachusetts, though it was decriminalized back a few years ago via ballot measure. Currently, the state must pay money to enforce laws against the selling, consumption, and distribution of marijuana. If the state were to stop these activities, then money might be saved for three reasons: the police are no longer purchasing weapons tied to the drug war (some towns have incentives to engage more in the war in drugs due to federal grant money being allotted to police departments engaging in it), and they are conducting fewer SWAT raids on people's homes. And thirdly, less people will be in jail, saving the state even more money. If this logically doesn't make sense, let me know. 

Next, let's logically tackle gambling. Currently we are actually in the works of having some casinos, but their fate in some towns isn't particularly clear. The raised revenue from legalized casinos would come from various places. We can infer that if someone currently wants to go to a casino, then they must leave the state, primarily to places like Foxwoods in Connecticut. If we're concerned about our roads staying maintained, then it makes sense to bring as much local business to Massachusetts as possible, like gambling, so others don't have to leave the state. Not only do people form Mass. drive south to Connecticut, but so might people from New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont. This puts a stress on our roads because all of this people must travel south. However, legalizing gambling in Mass. would mean our local residents will travel less on our roads, as will our northern New England neighbors. This saves us money in the end, theoretically. Plus, you get revenue from taxes, and local businesses get more customers, which boosts job creation, and therefore tax revenue. 

With that saved money (whatever it may be) resources can be directed towards the roads. Whatever is missing, can be raised by gambling and weed, if the two are to be legalized and taxes. 

&gt;I mean why should you guys pay a tax on your gas to support your infrastructure when you can just have someone else pay for it

Yes! Let's pay a tax on gas. That's totally, 100% no issue. But, remove the tie to inflation indefinitely, and have whatever needs to be made up paid for by taxing voluntary actions. And actually, there are plenty of taxes like this. For example, in many states like New Hampshire and Massachusetts, lottery sales revenue go towards education. What's the tie? There is none. But you're connecting a voluntary action (gambling) to a needed service (schools). Those paying for it are engaging in something that is not necessary for their lives, like driving to work. So should schools not get funding from lottery ticket sales? Maybe, maybe not, but the precedent for having a voluntary action pay for a public good is there, thus it's not out of line (within our state) to have something non-related to the roads pay for them anyway. 

For the record, I'd be comfortable tying the gas tax to inflation for a set number of years, and then having that voted on again. The principle of voting on things again would still be applicable. 

Another concern is that our state legislator may keep the law forever, without having to ever vote on it again (I realize this can be applied to any law, but for the sake of our discussion, let's keep it focused on the gas tax's tie to inflation so we can stay focused). Initially, you might respond ""So don't vote for people who support the bill"". Logically, this makes sense. But in practice, is does not. Just about [50-60% of our state legislature](http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2014/07/21/with-unopposed-races-mass-shortchanges-democracy/STFSVPs5ktMrPrrJdpZv4O/story.html) ran unopposed last election cycle, and will do the same again this year, with few facing primary challengers. For multiple reasons, few people step up to the plate to take on the Republicans, or Democrats in their voting districts. Even if groups like my own were to run candidates for office, it'd still be difficult to challenge every single unchallenged incumbent. Plus, remember that if a candidate outspends his opponent, then that more well funded candidate is [far more likely to win](http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2008/11/money-wins-white-house-and/). Considering my group or our partners don't have a tank of gold coins, it'd be difficult to beat any well funded Democrat (or Republican, for that matter). So quite literally, most of the time we have no one to vote for who can even agree with us on some things. So our final option then is to have measures we disapprove of talked about periodically (5-10 years) so we can at least attempt to influence our representatives how we see fit. If we're given that chance and we fail because other constituents have more say, so be it, at least we got to try.

I look forward to our discussion! Thanks again for your awesome response.

&gt;A month ago the state issued mandatory restrictions: basically, water districts must tell consumers to limit their use or face a fine. But some districts are experimenting with price incentives instead to achieve the same goal without mandates. 


&gt;Water rates - especially conservation-minded ones - get complicated fast. So we're using video games to illustrate a few different kinds in use around California. 


&gt;Uniform rates are like Pac-Man. 


&gt;In a uniform pricing system, each unit of water is priced the same - no matter where it comes from, no matter what it's used for, and no matter where it's going. 


&gt;If you've ever seen an Atari 5200, that might sound familiar. In the classic video game, Pac-Man gobbles up white dot after white dot, as the music wocka-wockas in the background. The white dots are like units of water. 


&gt;Consumers get a price signal from this kind of system: when they use more, they pay more. Theoretically, California water districts could set a high uniform rate, to encourage people to use less. But that means having to raise the price of even the first few units people use for necessities. 


&gt;Mesa Water (Costa Mesa and Laguna Beach in Orange County) uses uniform rates. 


&gt;Tiered rates are like Super Mario Bros. 


&gt;Well, they're sort of like Super Mario Bros. Imagine you're Mario, except you  want to stay safely on a lower level, rather than moving up and up and up...because when you go into the special bonus levels, you spend all those magic coins instead of collecting them for more life. 


&gt;In a tiered-rate system, the more water a consumer uses, the more expensive the water gets. A utility creates a ""block"" of usage based on some broad criteria, and applies that standard to everyone in a class - say, every single-family homeowner. Blow through your first block, and the next block -- the next level in Super Mario Bros. -- will cost you more money.


&gt;The point of tiered-block rates isn't to soak ratepayers. ""They do not change the overall amount collected by Cal Water, but high-water-using customers will pay more, and low-water-using customers will pay less,"" the private California Water company tells its customers. Instead, the higher levels are meant to promote conservation. 


&gt;Tiered rates have increased in popularity over the last quarter century. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power instituted tiered pricing, most recently in 2009. 


&gt;Allocation or budget pricing is like The Legend of Zelda. 


&gt;In the Legend of Zelda, a guy named Link navigates his way through the land of Hyrule. As he goes, he gathers fragments of the ""Triforce of Wisdom"" -- much the way water districts gather data about customers in order to offer a personalized ""allocation pricing"" budget for them. Pretend you're Link, with a quest to keep within that budget...or face a decision to spend significantly more money each month on water. 


&gt;Water budgets area way of personalizing or individualizing tiered pricing, by taking into account a number of variables that affect how each consumer might behave, such as home size, family size, and lot size. In this case, bigger is better because you're allocated more water at the outset. 


&gt;Some districts are enthusiastic about the boost allocation pricing gives to conservation. Irvine Ranch has one of the longest track records in using water budgets for Southern Californians.


&gt;The district put that pricing mechanism into place in 1991, following a multi-year drought in the late eighties. ""Our water use, our water demand never went back to that same level as before,"" says Fiona Sanchez, conservation manager for IRWD. Outdoor use has dropped 50% since 1991, and stayed down, she says. 


&gt;Irvine Ranch customers get 50 gallons per person per day for indoor use, with allocations for outdoor use dependent on, among other things, time of year.


&gt;Sanchez says Irvine Ranch reinvests revenue from excessive, inefficient and wasteful tiers, ""to fund rebates for turf, for drip irrigation, for high efficiency clothes washers. ""Because we want to provide assistance to customers to reduce their demand and be more successful,"" Sanchez said.


&gt;More recently, the Eastern Municipal Water District has brought budget pricing to the bills of its Inland Empire customers. 


&gt;UC Riverside economists studied around a decade of data for the district, bills from before and after the institution of water budgeting. ""The households that were the most inefficient users prior to the rate change showed the biggest reductions in water use and also the most resilient reductions,"" Baerenklau says. ""So 5 years after the rate change, the most inefficient households were about 25% below where we think they would have been under uniform prices.""


&gt;Eastern Municipal Water District, Irvine Ranch Water District and the city of San Juan Capistrano all use water budgeting for rates. 


&gt;But allocation pricing has its detractors, too. ""It’s much more cost to administer,"" says Sanjay Gaur, a water rates consultant. ""It's more complicated to explain to the public. And some politicians feel it's too big brother and intrusive, and you’re getting to people’s back yards too much."" ",1,PhinixPhire,True,t3_2e3560,0,cjvl041,0,1435448076,

New Zealand honey on average is the most expensive in the world.

This is important because until recently it was solely pushed by private enterprise with some serious issues such as counterfeit products and no licensing body . However, a recent boost in public and private funding under the high performance manuka plantation PGP is leading the way for a massive boost in supply of New Zealand honey. This has only just started in the past year or so and consequently there is high demand for bee keepers atm.

Current characters include Spiderman, the Fantastic Four, many of the X-Men and Avengers, Rocket and Star-Lord from Guardians of the Galaxy, and a couple others like Deadpool and Dr. Strange.  They're all unlockable with in-game currency, and normally you'll get enough for a new hero during the process of going from level 1 to level 60 on another one.

For example Griffin Bane is perfectly buyable for gold. It wasn't at day of release but after 3 weeks or so it's available for gold.

Second. Yes old cards are not available to buy for gold they are only for seals. But you can get those cards anyway using for example wildcards or infernal pit, or playing solo player campaign, or achievements. But you should ask yourself a question, do you need them? Truth if they are used only for one type of game 'Open'. There is plenty of different game formats to choose from, but let's imagine that you really want to play 'Open'. Then wildcards is more then enough to collect that 0-20 cards that you may require to your open deck.

I agree in one thing cards are more expensive in terms, you have to farm more wildcards to actually get a card that you really need. If you do not have that many wildcards you have to open more boosters and this means more games to be played. But you will have to play those games anyway, if you want to be good at this game. 

So if you want to play ""Open"" format and cannot leave without it, yes game will ask you to invest cash (if you want to be super efficient). But if you are fine with other formats, then this is more free to play than ever, and for sure not to pay-to-win, because you cannot win more by just simply paying.",1,Drachenfels,True,t3_2awn3y,0,cjuvo1g,0,1435324477,

This means every time you win or lose, you gain or lose points, how many depending on the rank of your opponent.

The system then tries to match you up with a partner who has a similar MMR. This roughly equates to you playing against players of similar skill level. The more you win, the higher your rating goes up and the higher the skill level of your opponents, and vice versa.

It's not perfect, but it's better than random. There's no way to see what your MMR number is or anything like that, and PTCGO has no overall ranking system in place or anything like that.

You'll need to play a bunch of games before your rank starts to level out. So if you are already experienced from playing the live game, you may find your opponents are easier to beat in the beginning.

---

**Question 2:** You get a code in every real life pack you buy that gives you a virtual pack in PTCGO. You can collect cards like this, and you can trade packs and cards for other cards, either in the Public Offers section of Trade, or by connecting with other players in chat.

People also purchase the codes for packs with money and other trades. Many players of the live game don't care to play online and so the codes aren't worth very much for them. This means you can buy virtual packs at fraction of the cost of real packs. So a lot of players do purchase packs and either open lots of them or use them to trade for the cards they want.

Basically, the monetary value of cards in PTCGO is much less than real cards, so it is much easier for players to obtain more valuable cards.

If you want to get geared up:

Loot Spec - right-click your portrait, then hover over loot spec, then click whatever spec from your class you want to get loot from when you get it from LFR/Flex/World Bosses/bonus rolls. Very helpful for gearing up an offspec, or to get tank/healer gear while running as DPS.

Timeless Isle: tokens for item level 496 gear can be found from mobs, rares, and chests (Lavalliere is Neck, Signets are Rings, Curio is Trinket, Caches can make a random piece of armor of that type, others are self-explanatory), use them to create a piece of gear for your loot spec, or hold off until you get a Burden of Eternity to make that item level 496 an item level 535 (doesn't work on Trinkets).

Also on Timeless Isle is gear available for Timeless coins (the stuff you get from everything on the Isle: 10,000 for an item level 489 One-hand or offhand, 20,000 for an item level 489 two-hander, or 50,000 for an item level 535 Trinket. You can also buy Burdens of Eternity for 50,000 coins, and Caches for 7,500 coins.

There's also the Celestials (raid-group-level bosses, if a group is fighting it, just run in and tag it to get loot :D) which drop the item level 553 Tier Hands &amp; Legs, and item level 550 PVP gear (even though it's PVP, it's equal to item level 550 PVE gear, though sockets are going to be PVP oriented), and should you complete the Legendary Cloak questline, there's Ordos who drops item level 559 gear. All of the gear from Celestials &amp; Ordos is ""personal"", so you're not rolling against anyone else; you get loot or you get a bag with gold (and sometimes other stuff).

Lesser Charms of Good Fortune &amp; Warforged Seals (and to a lesser extent, Elder Charms of Good Fortune &amp; Mogu Runes of Fate): Every week, at your factions Shrine in Vale of Eternal Blossoms, you can talk to Elder Lin or Elder Liao (lower level) to exchange 50 Lesser Charms of Good Fortune (found by killing level 90 mobs and tons of other stuff) fr three Warforged Seals. Warforged Seals allow you to get a ""Bonus roll"" on Siege of Orgrimmar (SoO) bosses, as well as the Celestials &amp; Ordos, which grant you another ""spin"" at their loot table for your loot spec. If you don't get an item, you get gold, and it increases your chances to get an item the next time you use a Seal. You can also purchase Elder Charms of Good Fortune for use on Tier 14 bosses (Mogu'shan Vaults [MSV], Heart of Fear [HoF], Terrace of Eternal Spring [ToES], and the world bosses Sha of Anger &amp; Galleon), and Mogu Runes of Fate for use on Tier 15 bosses (Throne of Thunder [ToT], and the world bosses Nalak &amp; Oondasta).

As for Gear, you have:

Timeless Isle Weapons: 489

Timeless Isle basic tokens: 496

Throne of Thunder LFR: 502

Throne of Thunder Normal/Thunderforged: 522/528

Siege of Orgrimmar LFR: 528

Timeless Isle upgraded: 535

Throne of Thunder Heroic/Thunderforged: 535/541

Siege of Orgrimmar Flexible: 540

Siege of Orgrimmar Normal/Warforged: 553/559

Siege of Orgrimmar Heroic/Warforged: 566/572

This is a purely numerical standpoint; you can also use your Valor Points to upgrade your purple gear (or Justice Points to upgrade your blue gear); items introduced in 5.4 (Siege of Orgrimmar drops, Timeless Isle gear + Ordos gear) can be upgraded four times for a total of +16 item levels, while other purple gear from Mists of Pandaria can only be upgraded twice, for a total of +8 item levels.

Note that Thunderforged &amp; Warforged are chances when loot drops from a boss in Throne of Thunder or Siege of Orgrimmar normal or heroic, it will be upgraded by 6 item levels, as noted by ""Thunderforged"" or ""Warforged"" under the item name. It's not a guarantee, but is a nice boost.

Edit: also, the Legendary Cloak Chain Quest Achievement Thing:

Wowhead has a couple of guides up for it. The [Overview](http://www.wowhead.com/guide=2016) one is nice and concise. Every single step of this quest chain can be done on **ANY** raid difficulty. Basically:

Go from Neutral to Exalted with Wrathion by killing level 90+ Mogu &amp; Mantid in Townlong Steppes, Dread Wastes &amp; Vale of Eternal Blossoms, opposite-faction level 90+ forces in Krasarang Wilds, and the various level 90+ mobs on Isle of Thunder. You don't need to hit Exalted to get the first part of the quest chain done, but you'll need it by the end.

Collect 20 Sigils from the bosses in Mogu'shan Vaults, Heart of Fear, Terrace of Endless Spring, Throne of Thunder, and the first 8 bosses of Siege of Orgrimmar. Lei Shen (last boss of ToT), Ra-den (bonus boss of Heroic ToT) and Sha of Doubt (fourth boss of SoO) have guaranteed drops.

Go back to ToES and kill the Sha of Fear (last boss) **and loot its corpse** to get the Chimera of Fear.

**At this point, you get a Legendary Gem that can only be socketed in special weapons from HoF &amp; ToES. Sucks, I know**

Start up the 5.1 Dominance Offensive/Operation: Shieldwall chain.

Collect 3,000 Valor Points. Yes, this will take a minimum of 3 weeks.

Win the following BGs (rated or non): Silvershard Mines, Temple of Kotmogu.

Kill the opposite faction's boss in their base in Krasarang Wilds.

**At this point, you get an extra socket for the weapon you may or may not have socketed the legendary gem into**

Collect 20 completely different drops from bosses in ToT &amp; the first 8 bosses of SoO, along with 40 Trillium Bar. Again, Lei Shen, Ra-den &amp; Sha of Pride are guaranteed.

Complete the Thunder Forge solo scenario.

Use some alternate tactics with Nalak (the world boss on Isle of Thunder) to get the next drop.

**Hooray, you now have a bitchin' Meta-Gem, and can buy extras for 5x uncut Primal Diamond from Wrathion's vendor at his Inn.**

Collect 12 more drops from bosses; this time it's the last 6/7 bosses in ToT and the first 8 in SoO. Again, Lei Shen, Ra-den &amp; Sha of Pride are guaranteed.

Kill **and loot** Lei Shen for yet another required drop.

Speak to the four Celestials at their Temples in Pandaria.

Complete one of their trials (Xuen for Melee DPS, Yu'lon for Ranged DPS, Niuzao for Tanks, Chi-ji for Healers). Niuzao &amp; Chi-ji have tricks to them, so if you can do either as your class, try it :D

**Hooray, and Epic Cloak. Don't do anything to it. Seriously. It only gets better, and exerything you put on it gets re-written. Enchants, Gems, reforges, upgrades, etc.**

Give Wrathion 5,000 Timeless coins.

Defeat **all four** Celetials on the Timeless Isle. They rotate, and between the oQueue addon and WoW's in-game groupfinder, you should be able to do this pretty easily (especially early in the week).

**At this point, you have your Legendary Cloak. Bitchin', huh? You can talk to Wrathion's vendor to buy other copies of the epic cloak, and an item to turn them into the legendary, if you have need of it for an offspec or whatnot**

Take the DE (this is not a discussion about how to attack, so I'll leave that out).

Make sure that you have a builder free (for heroes) or the lab free for DE upgrade and as soon as you have the required amount, start the upgrade.

&gt; Despite the fact that Asian American men living in the US are quite possibly the single most privileged group in the world in terms of wealth, opportunities, and access to resources, you've decided that because a large number of ""your"" women outmarry (which should be expected in a low-population, highly sophisticated immigrant population), there must be some extensive, racist conspiracy.

&gt; You then close out with a link to a PBF comic, apparently comparing asian women who prefer white men to a fairy creature who prefers to fuck rats.

The privelege of AA men! What high profile ones in the media did I forget? [As for Asian-American privilege, what are you talking about? Here are the rates of poverty.](http://blog.angryasianman.com/2013/12/five-reasons-why-asian-american-pacific.html)

* 45.2% Asian &amp; PI
* 42.8% Hispanic
* 25.5% Native Americans
* 21.9% White
* 21.1% Black

[Honestly, you don't even know the basics.](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=185534666)  We have the highest rates of poverty.

&gt; You probably have personal problems with women, and it is probably not due to your race. Seriously, I'm tempted to do a point-by-point rebuttal to each of your absurd claims. Hell, let's do a few:

Thanks for the pyschoanalysis, but I don't have personal problems with women because as I said I'm lucky. I'm surrounded by people who don't judge others by race, but as Du Bois's Talented Tenth doesn't represent African-Americans, the top Asian-American men's lives doesn't reflect the demographic.

My problem is with institutional racism, and I'm more likely to be aware of the first-hand experience of my demographic. An ex-girlfriend introduced me to alot of these issues as she was studying sociology, and she became interested in Asian-Americans given she was dating one.

&gt; Yu Darvish is unknown? Absolute bullshit, he is a huge name and well-recognized.

He's probably one of the better known players, so I'm willing to concede this somewhat. Given that he's of two different ethnicities, had a couple of famously rare moments, and plays for Texas. However, you won't find him on any top jersey sales or most popular players list, but it could be that he's foreign.

For someone who's doing a point-by-point rebuttal, let's address Jeremy Lin. What other California High School player of the year doesn't get a single D1 scholarship offer?  He also won the state championship over an accomplished favorite. [He was the only finalist to not get an offer, which never happens because those guys are automatic scholarships guys.](http://espn.go.com/blog/high-school/california/post/_/id/631/jeremy-lin-and-the-2006-all-state-team) In fact, alot more guys that the final 7 finalist get offers.

&gt; Joining Lin as first team all-state picks were the other six Mr. Basketball finalists – senior Ryan Anderson from Oak Ridge of El Dorado Hills, junior James Harden of Artesia, junior Taylor King of Mater Dei, senior Chase Budinger from La Costa Canyon of Carlsbad, senior James Keefe from Santa Margarita of Rancho Santa Margarita and senior Tre’Von Willis from Washington of Easton – plus senior De’Shon Jackson of Clovis West, senior Adrian Oliver of Modesto Christian and senior Alex Stepheson from Harvard-Westlake of North Hollywood.

Those are the names. One NBA star, two made it, and rest are practically nobodies. You know what they all are though? D1 college scholarship players. Just like they are every year, with a longer list of names who don't make 1st team.

&gt; Complaining about affirmative action? Yes, Asian Americans largely come from incredibly privileged families, so the less privileged minorities are in some cases given a boost; despite this, Asians absolutely fill college campuses in any states with a significant Asian population. The massive latino population, meanwhile, is left at the door because they cannot afford the same quality of care and education from birth through college as the average American Asian has access to; this is despite their affirmative action ""bonus.""

Asian-Americans do not come from privileged families, a portion earn their way into the upper middle class. This generation and the past ones are from poor families. [Here's an example from NYC's high schools.](http://nypost.com/2014/07/19/why-nycs-push-to-change-school-admissions-will-punish-poor-asians/)

&gt; But Asians also have the highest poverty rate of any racial group in New York, with 29 percent living below the poverty level, compared with 26 percent of Hispanics, 23 percent of blacks and 14 percent of whites. Poor Asians lag far behind whites and are barely ahead of blacks and Latinos. Thus, the income spectrum among Asians in New York ranges from a surprisingly large number in poverty, through a hardworking lower middle class, and on to a more affluent upper middle class.

We don't get a bonus from affirmative action, we're the ones that pay the price for it. [The Asian men specifically pay the biggest price, and we're made invisible in areas where we've worked the hardest.](http://static.businessinsider.com/image/53ecca1cecad04be2ba65d7e-1200/slide.jpg) I've showed the studies on Asian quotas, how did you not see or understand that? [Here's an introduction to some of the discrimination in college admissions we face.](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-myth-of-american-meritocracy/)

&gt; ""Our counterpart females leave us"" Wow, I had no idea you had a birthright to these ""counterpart females."" What are you, a fucking robot? They didn't LEAVE YOU. THEY WERE NEVER WITH YOU. YOU DO NOT HAVE A SPECIAL CLAIM TO THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE THE SAME RACE AS YOU.

Women are independent actors, just like men are. They're free to make life choices as they please. Let's be clear about this, because you're trying to strawman me into someone who thinks women are property as you act morally superior. Go watch those videos again, and check out the statistics on AA female depression/suicide and their 4:1 STD ratio, contrasting the 1.5:1 or 1:1 of other races, along with the 1:1 STD ratio of Asians in other countries. Alot of their relationships are due to massive insecurities brought about by institutional racism. You dismissing their collective choice as egalitarian again shows you don't have a fundamental understanding of Asian-American issues.  You're surrounded by the privileged.

&gt; ""Watch shows or movies from the past few decades and look at every Asian male with consistently negative depictions. They are cast as sexless, clowns, kung fu machines, wife abusers, villains, misogynistic, feminine, etc."" Oh yeah, kung fu machines, such an effeminate, weak stereotype! Bruce Lee sure brings to mind a loser who couldn't possibly keep a girlfriend! Can't think of a single wife abuser or anything like that. Clowns? No more often than whites, blacks, whatever. You have to go way back to get the evil villain stereotypes; these were probably driven by Cold War fears and such. Still, not a ""weak, effeminate"" stereotype.

You mean the Bruce Lee that's 1/4 white? [You mean the Bruce Lee that was still passed over for Kung-Fu TV show for David Carradine?](http://www.racialicious.com/2009/06/05/david-carradines-legacy-of-shame/) You mean when he had to leave Hollywood, because he couldn't get his acting career going and left for Hong Kong? He made his movies there, which became popular despite little help from Hollywood. He overcame Hollywood and fought racism. He put guys like Kareem Abdul Jabbar in his films, who now writes alot about social issues and race, which you can read. He's written good stuff about Donald Sterling and the Ferguson riots.

&gt; Maybe I'm not sympathetic because I've always been around Asians and I've always seen Asian men and women together. Lots of Asian women absolutely prefer Asian men; I also knew several white women who preferred Asian men. The types of Asian men who were ""denied access"" were generally similar to the types of white guys who couldn't get a date, either. Both groups deserve understanding, but they do not have some blood claim on women of their race.

The white women with Asian men are heavily skewed towards the upper middle class, with high education and income.  It doesn't represent Asians or Asian men.  You're basically saying that your anecdotes outweigh the vast studies on this issue.  I'm happy that you're surrounded by decent people where race is mostly a non-issue, but it isn't how most people live.  I personally don't have these issues either, so I'm not looking for sympathy.  I'm trying to convey an overlooked branch of racism that exists.

&gt; Finally, Asian women seem more comfortable with dating outside their race. This is a virtue, in my opinion; racial insularity is a symptom of racism. If a white guy wrote a post like that about white women dating black men it would rightfully be considered shameful.

Stop strawmaning me as the Asian KKK. A white guy doesn't face the institutional racism of Asians. It's a non-comparison.  I respect the individual choices a woman or man can make. I've set up female Asian friends with guys who aren't Asian, because they're good guys and not their race. There's long lists you can look up yourself of the roles that Asian men play in Hollywood.

&gt; Bottom line: No one owes you sex, least of all because of your race.

No shit, we agree.  No one has said otherwise.

&gt; Protip: Assuming that every single cultural event happening around you is in furtherance of a horrible plot to highlight your inadequacies is well beyond paranoid.

Amateur tip: you're not a pro, you just throw out opinions.  You're an ignorant ass, and dismissing racism alongside acting morally superior and condescending reflects that.",2,[deleted],True,t3_2dkr52,0,cjuhmp4,0,1435316686,
0,This game is about trains,t1_cjufbku,24,1408442429,,t3_2dyuw8,False,openttd,False,train-other,t5_2royw,"My goal is generally to grow my economy (money) as fast as possible, so that I can create whatever I want. Once I have entered exponential growth, my options become far better and I can start building a “real” network. Here’s how I go about it (assuming temperate/~1950s start or thereabouts), and assuming trains are your main thing.  
1)	First, you want to create a lucrative passenger network. Open up the towns list and sort them by population (highest to lowest)   
2)	Take a look at the top 5 towns and work out which of them are somewhat near each other. Assuming a starting loan of £200,000, a distance of around 200 tiles is manageable. Ideally, both towns will have a population of 2000 or higher, however as long as you have over 1000 you should be fine.  
3)	Build a large station at both towns – note that you want room for expansion if possible. Turn on the option to highlight the catchment area and play around with placement of the station so that it captures the largest number of building possible. In particular, you should aim to get in amongst the CBD, with the tower blocks. If you need to demolish one or two houses in order to get the best spot, do it – just be very cautious that you don’t go too far and piss off the local authority or else you won’t be able to build in the town. I usually start with 4x tracks, 6 tiles long. If possible, make a RoRo station (roll on/roll off, [like this](https://wiki.openttd.org/images/0/01/RailStTut_Four_aro_ore.png) – it’s faster). If space is limited, you may need to make a [terminal station]( https://wiki.openttd.org/images/1/1a/RailStTut_Four_str_ore.png) instead.  
4)	Begin constructing your track. First priority is to join the stations with a single track, so that you can get an income. You can add a second track once you have money rolling in. Aim to have straight, clear runs of track so that your trains can run at max speed for as much as possible.  
5)	Buy the fastest possible train and make it up to 6 tiles long (or however long your station is) with passenger/mail cars. My rule of thumb is that I only make 1 mail car for every 5 passenger cars or part thereof. Thus a 6-tile long train would have the engine, would have 9 passenger cars and 2 mail vans.  
6)	Set the train to collect a full load (any cargo) at both ends. Your train will now start rolling back and forth collecting money. At these distances, (and depending on the year) you should expect to earn around 20-25k per trip, which is a lot less than many cargo types – however, you get to earn in both directions, so your profit will be very rapid.  
7)	Put in passing places so that you can add a second train, and eventually upgrade the track to a full dual line (follow [this guide](https://wiki.openttd.org/Tutorial/Two_Tracks) for tips on doing this)  
8)	Once you have a solid dual line, you can start adding more trains. I usually have 5-6 total – enough so that the passenger/mail numbers at each station is kept low, but not so much that your trains are constantly bleeding it dry.  
9)	You will now rapidly build income which you can use to “go large”. I usually go in one of two directions from here.   
10)	For one option, I will add more towns to my current network and gradually connect all of the nearby large towns. I also look at connecting a supply of goods to the network which will help to grow the towns quickly. (On desert or arctic maps, you will also need food/water (I don’t play candyland, but the principles still apply)). As the network expands, the towns will grow, enabling you to add more of those juicy passenger trains and rake in more cash. In a way, you are building upon your starting network and using it as an organic “heart” of your network.  
11)	A second option is to abandon the town/passenger network entirely, and begin working on large scale freight transport. Coal, Wood, Livestock and grain, iron ore, Oil – any primary resource is fine, all of them have their place and their value. Start with the primary resources, and aim to haul across the largest possible distances. You have a huge income from the passenger network, which will last forever. This will let you spend plenty of money to build a gigantic secondary freight network with large capacities, RoRo stations and plenty of [nice](https://wiki.openttd.org/images/9/94/Compact_3_way.png)   [junctions](https://wiki.openttd.org/images/0/0b/Ultimate_3way_junction.png)  
12)	You can always join your two networks together – typically, to deliver goods to the towns. Once again, if you have goods coming into your towns, you can expect them to grow which will in turn expand your income and enable more passenger trains.    
13)	Tip: Build your tracks to stand the strain of high volumes of traffic. That way, you can keep dumping trains on the network without too much concern for congestion. Take your time to build nice, big stations at your key hubs (eg towns, or factories/sawmills where you expect a lot of traffic). You can generally keep your primary resource stations at a smaller scale.  
14)	Tip: You can use a small feeder bus network to boost your station’s passenger count. By building bus stations all over the town and ordering your buses to “transfer and leave empty” at your main station, you will be effectively expanding the catchment area of your station so that you are picking up a ton more passengers.  
15)	Tip: Use road vehicles to feed into your stations. E.g If you have 2-3 coal mines relatively near to each other (say, within 20 tiles, just outside the extent of a single station catchment), it’s probably best to build near one mine, and use trucks to transfer coal from the other one. That way, again, you effectively expand the catchment of your station.  
16)	If your server allows aircraft, you can basically skip the whole thing. Build one airport in one town on the coast, and another airport on the opposite edge of the map. You will quickly earn enough money to expand to other towns and your income will be ridiculous. It takes little time and very little skill, which is why many servers ban planes, but if the option is there, it’s a great way to boost your income early on.

0,,t1_cju9pgv,1,1408421593,,t3_2dwxm4,False,boardgames,False,,t5_2qmjp,"There's a lot of different strategies and there are different things to keep in mind. A four player game is going to play differently than a six player game. A few universal tips to keep in mind:

1. Know your opponents personalities and tendencies. Do they tend to be aggressive or conservative? Are they impulsive or deliberate? Are they vengeful? Are they adamant about having a continent locked up even if it's not the smartest move? These things can help you plan your moves.

2. Think ahead. Where do you want to be at the end of your turn? In 3 turns? Map it out but be flexible.

3. Put yourselves in everyone else's shoes. When it's not your turn you're thinking about what you hope your opponent does and doesn't do. So put yourself in their position for that. What is the one thing that they're hoping doesn't happen? What move of yours will each of your opponents be happiest about? You can really put your opponents on the defensive and ruin their plans if you think along these lines.

4. Don't trap yourself in to any one style of play within an individual game. You need to adapt to board conditions. Sometimes you get a continent early and that's great. Sometimes you need to abandon that continent and make an attack that can eliminate another player and net you cards. 

5. Know the strengths and weakness of each continent. I'm speaking largely in terms of a six player game, but it can be relevant to smaller games as well.

   i. Australia - Easily defended with only one point of entry, gives you a steady if small bonus. The downside is that you can get sucked in to Australia and struggle to defend. Most players like to keep a large stack in Siam to give a full defense of their continent, especially if another player is roaming in Asia with a large army. However, this can lead to being trapped. Also, even in a best case scenario, you are removed from most of the action and you might miss out on being able to eliminate players, collect cards, and making big boosts to your army.

   ii. South America - Similar to Australia in that it offers a small, steady bonus. Only two chokepoints makes it reasonably defendable. Africa will often leave you alone because they are more worried about Europe. N/A will leave either leave you alone to take a few times to take all of that continent, or will avoid the risk of attacking a large army in Venezuela. The downside is that you may have trouble expanding out of S/A. You'll either have to a) penetrate in to Central America. This is often the best option as your most likely facing a smaller army and maintaining a chokepoint. b) penetrate in to North Africa. This maintains a checkpoint and can really cripple someone who is attempting to control Africa but your often looking at a decent sized army. or c) Create a separate army somewhere, probably Asia, to continue collecting cards. The downside of this is it prevents you from further protecting your continent.

   iii. Africa - A difficult continent that often requires a truce to be successful. 3 chokepoints are North Africa, Egypt, and ideally Middle East. Middle East really opens things up if you can control Africa. A truce with Europe offers a short term boost in your stability, but Europe will outpace your production and become a threat that may become too big too handle. A S/A truce is useful, but you're still required to keep North Africa militarized against Europe. Sometimes it's best to slow play, keep a big stack and collect the territories one by one until you can get a trade that will allow you to fully defend.

   iv. Europe - Very powerful if successful, but you're likely to be a target. N/A will threaten from Greenland, Africa may be adamant about you not getting the continent. Africa may be willing to sacrifice a continental bonus to prevent you from getting the bonus. In a six player game, a roaming Asia can pose a large threat. Things can start to go downhill quickly. It's often best to slow play Europe. Create a stack in Iceland early to make it an unattractive play for a N/A player. Then slowly expand through the rest of Europe and use a trade in to secure the southern and eastern border. A truce with Africa is in your favor when possible. 

   v. North America - 3 chokepoints, a lot of territory to conquer, but a big bonus. South America is usually your primary threat as Central America is where they will probably try to expand in to. A truce with Europe is often helpful as it's often a stalemate anyway and the bonuses are equal. Alaska is often fairly safe, though a roaming Asia can be a fast materializing threat. Needing to possess 9 territories requires a slow play, but it can be done.

   vi - Asia - You're not going to possess Asia. Maybe in the very end of the game if you're just shy of finishing someone off, but not before that. The best thing to do is to keep a stack together and be a threat to Australia, N/A, Europe and Africa. Put yourself in the bset osition to finish off an opponent. Don't landlock your stack by possessing a single territory that prevents you from moving in a desirable direction. You can act as the balance of power by a) preventing Australia from expanding. A large Asia stack will often make Australia go conservative, keeping a large force in Siam and landlocking a big chunk of their army b) busting through weak defenses in N/A, Europe, and Africa. You also get to play the role of sweeper. If there is a big battle between Europe/Africa you will have a good chance of cleaning up and finishing off a weakened opponent. You have great access to nearly everyone if they get in to a major battle that leaves them crippled. Asia requires patience but I've won many times as Asia.

6. Understand the risks. You're gambling, it's a dice game. Attackers have the advantage when it is 2-1, 3-1, and 3-2, but it's not going to work out everytime. Know when it's time to quit an attack and when it's worth it to keep going. Have those ideas formed at the time of the initial attack and don't chase losses unnecessarily.

7. Make yourself an unattractive target. Focus your strength in as few territories as possible. No one wants to attack a stack of 10 if they can avoid it. If you don't have a continent but you have a reasonable army, you won't be attacked. Save that final piece of the puzzle when you're fully ready to defend it.

8. Play often. Try different things out. See what suits your personality and style of play. There are some good phone apps that you can play a lot of games on in a short amount of time. I've used LandRule in the past and enjoyed it.

0:00: Item choice (tangos, clarity, salve, 3x GG branch) is solid. Could cut one or two thing out for a quicker bottle.

0:30: Riki mid? You should stomp this lane.

1:32: OK we're at our 3rd creep wave and your CS is 4/2. OK, but could be better. Save your crypt swarm for if you can get 2 creep kills or 1 creep kill and hit the enemy hero. You got lucky that he drew tower aggro early.

2:20: You backed up to block a wave. I wouldn't do that in this situation, you want to sit closer to the creep equilibrium to soak up XP/last hits. You have enough money for a bottle now and you should be sending the bottle your way. Some better last hitting earlier though (apparently Riki isn't comfortable with the concept of denying).

3:31: Your skill build is 2-1-2 right now. IMO 3-0-2 is better since it helps with your damage output and CS more, and Riki isn't going to be doing that much casting.

4:00: Why are you hanging so far back in lane still? You needlessly gave up CS hanging back.

5:00: Ah, I see you were waiting so you could grab boots AND the bottle in one courier trip. Don't wait for your boots to get bottle since getting that mana/hp regen ASAP would make it a lot easier for you to zone out Riki.

5:15: No clue what a 1/3 life SS is doing there, but he'd have a tough time ganking you! You would have been able to get the kill here if you moved towards him after each autoattack (so spending the cooldown time between your attack swing and your next attack by moving closer to your opponent).

5:24: Also I'm guessing you missed the missing call on Riki because you were busy fiddling with the courier. I wouldn't blame yourself too much; what the hell is your Alch doing staying in lane at 150 health.

6:25: Few avoidable last hit misses - one because you drew tower aggro and went all the way back to your highground, one because you were on lowground and missed your last hit.

7:08: You're doing a pretty good job harassing SS. No need to silence him when both his abilities are on cooldown.

7:35: Man, I would've murdered alch if he just sat there ""guarding"" a regen rune for 30 seconds and as soon as you're about to grab it he grabs it himself.

8:15: That was an ill-advised Serpent Ward drop (should've done it at least in the range of your towers so he could get your tier 1!) but it looks like your skill point in silence paid off - he was planning on following that up with a hex which might have killed you. Good escape.

9:05: Hitting crypt swarm instead of silence there on Riki would've got him.

9:49: I would say skip the magic wand for the quicker Arcane boots. No need to TP mid, much better to have a TP in your inventory and walk there especially since Earthshaker is minding the lane.

11:43: Your team needs detection. I think using your ult there was the right thing to do; you thought you were trapped and about to be killed by SS and Riki and it got you a kill and you ended up living. If PL was with you when Riki Blink Striked you, you would've killed him.

12:30: Don't know what you're doing just chilling behind the tower doing nothing for about 20 seconds. A trip back to town would've refilled your bottle and made sure you were full health.

13:20: I see you're hoping to knock over the tower with your ult but you don't have the creepwave to support you.

14:20: Nice job escaping NS. Needless to say, your ES dropped the ball and you could've easily killed him if he didn't goof up.

15:15: Another kill on the SS! Remember, as DP you're FAST, so if a hero like SS is running chase him down immediately.

17:15: I can't go on any further without commenting on KotL's Morbid Mask. lolwut.

17:36: NICE RIKI KILL

17:50: GOD DAMN PIECE OF SH@#% ALCH TAKING ANOTHER RUNE F#^%)* ME

19:25: Good ult in mid, but the tower's in deny range. I just watched three heroes waltz by a regen rune. Bottle that up.

20:26: Yay you got the rune! Euls, as I mentioned in the base post, is a great pickup on DP. Helps make her even faster, adds all that regen, and when you ult you can cyclone yourself to give you 2.5 seconds of invulnerability.

21:20: I don't like this ult as much; you had the tower no problem without it. They contested mid as you continued to push bot. Carry a TP so you can go and help (with your ult up!).

22:12: They took your mid tower while you farmed bot. You would've gotten the kill on NS if you hadn't missed one of your crypt swarms.

23:48: WOOHOO TRIPLE KILL! Exorcism spits out so much damage.

25:07: You're still missing a lot of last hits, this time because you should've crypt swarm when you autoattacked. You shouldn't be buying a second energy booster since you can disassemble your Arcane Boots and use the energy booster there to make your bloodstone.

25:40: First death :( I think you could've outran them here; the ult + eul's wasn't enough time against three full life opponents. Just ulting may have saved you as it would've dissuaded them from chasing as you ran away.

28:55: If you see the rune, you can't leave it alone.

29:43: Also, you had previously walked by your bottom T2 tower, which had 33 health. Deny it!

29:57: Late game if you're farming waves, hit the ranged creep once, get a hit or two on one of the melee creeps that your creeps aren't attacking, then crypt swarm. Boom 3 kills and ~120 gold. You're leaving a lot of gold on the table by opening with the crypt swarm (at least get the easy last hit on the ranged creep!).

32:05: Your dudes are dying mid. Help them!

32:38: Great double kill! When you're doing ult+eul, wait until everyone starts focusing you before you throw the Eul - that will maximize effectiveness.

33:40: You screwed yourself over while messing with the courier. So much went wrong there, but you shouldn't have been sitting there in the first place. Just go back to base, get everything straightened out, and get your Bloodstone.

36:15: Stay in the middle of everything when you have your ult up. You could've dealt a lot more damage in that engagement if you stayed closer to the action (and remember, you've got the eul's adding 2.5 seconds invulnerability if needed).

36:50: Almost always save up for the Reaver before buying the recipe. The Reaver will provide HP while the recipe will just sit in your inventory collecting dust.

37:15: Weird engagement with the SS. You could've easily finished him off despite your low HP.

38:50: Right now your PL is balling pretty hard and they think they can still take you in team fights but can't. The tide of the game has fully swung in your favor.

42:09: Dang, almost got him! Probably could've; you should've moved a bit more aggressively on him to start. You did play that one very well though.

I hesitate to use an example from my job, so I'm making up a convoluted example here off the top of my head...say you have a collection of objects and you want to get a certain item out of the collection that may not be there.  The collection is large and you don't want to write two functions to test for it's occurrence and then then return it, you want to do this all at once.  So, you return an optional object.

There are, in fact, several ways around this, none of which are truely satisfactory for reasons of code maintainability.  Think of it from the perspective of someone looking at your code in the future.  One way is to throw an exception.  However this implies that an error is occurred which isn't always the case, and forces you to litter try/catch blocks everywhere, obscuring your code flow.  

The other common solution is to return a placeholder value, such as a null pointer, or how the std uses the `end` iterator.  The problem here is that it's not always obvious that the returned value doesn't exist...for example, if I return a pointer to the object, it may be because I'm transferring ownership, or because the object is large and I'm insane and don't trust move constructors or RVO.  Users of of my function may not think ""oh I should check to make sure this isn't `null`"".

The third option is to cache the value during this calculation so that multiple calls to ""does that item exist"" and ""lets get that item"" don't do extra work.  Congratulations, you've invented `optional`.

`optional` is obvious what it does...it maybe holds an object, and maybe it doesn't.  Any user who has an optional object should know that, before they use the object they should check to make sure it's actually there, or at least throw in an assert statement.

I may have rambled a bit...it's a bit late for me.  Quick googling came up with [this tangentially related article](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/UsingAndAvoidingNullExplained) about using `optional` to avoid null pointer exceptions...perhaps it can explain better than I can.

The implications of the formula may not be immediately clear, so I'll give you a rundown:

small payload = moderate launch stage, large payload = insane behemoth. **Shrink your payload!**

Empty fuel tanks are dead weight. unnecessary engines are dead weight. When you carry dead weight, you lose efficiency. This is why asparagus staging is so effective at boosting efficiency - The *instant* a tank/engine is no longer required to maintain TWR, it gets dropped.

If your mission involves land/return, seek to leave your transfer stage in orbit and rendezvous with it afterwards. As per Tsiolkovsky, leaving that weight in orbit allows a smaller lander, which in turn shrinks the transfer stage itself, as well as the launcher.

Also, you might seek to leave larger science modules behind, eg the goo canister and materials bay. Land, do science, collect science into your command pod then ditch them.

**Mass reduction = efficiency!**

As for TWR, for launch you should aim for a TWR between 1.7 and 2.1 for the first 4400m/s ΔV. This will help you stay near terminal velocity, the minima in fuel consumption where drag losses and gravity losses cross over. After that, you can get away with as little as 0.5 but your burn times will become long.

Engine efficiency is technically called Specific Impulse (Isp), measured in seconds. It's essentially how long a given engine can provide a specific amount of thrust, given a specific amount of fuel.

The LV-N is a clear winner for Isp, but its thrust is tiny and it's quite heavy so it is not always the best engine to use.

If part count wasn't problematic, the 48-7S would be the best engine in many cases where the LV-N isn't quite so desirable.

Note that purely due to the LV-N's mass, you can get more ΔV with the 48-7S on very small ships than with the LV-N!",1,triffid_hunter,True,t3_2dxgd2,0,cju2hcg,0,1435309529,

By this, do you mean exhibits growling, baring teeth, stiffness, will bite if you reach out to him, etc? Or is he potentially growling and trying to engage you in play/get you to chase him? Its very common for puppies to steal things and run away (play 'keep away'). If you know its resource guarding, you can google/search on how to work on trading items for treats.


It sounds like the dog lunged at your nose in play. This is another reason not to teach 'soft mouthing', he could easily have been ""soft mouthing"" your face (seen it as appropriate), but human skin is not dog skin, nor are his teeth very 'soft' at this age!



Your father in law may just have a 'good vibe' or be a 'dog person', some people I find just naturally work with dogs a lot better then others. Often, these people are very calm and collected (Ive found). Someone who is stressed trying to train a dog, frustrated with their lack of response to others, etc, I can see getting very down about this--this doesn't mean your a bad owner or have a bad dog!


My rule of my thumb, which many people compliment is a great dog and is very 'bonded' to me (despite her not really caring much about me, and me not really feeling like she's a great dog most of the time) is that I always try to set my dog up for success, and if she fails, she's a dog. I just keep working with her. I dont get mad or frustrated, life happens. She is a dog, I am only human, I can only do my best. You have a VERY young dog, they do lots of stupid and annoying things at this age. I found the best way I learned to trust and bond with my dog was: 


* training classes (and talking to the other people in the training classes) and exercise in general. A tired dog is a happy dog. It makes training and skills easier to perform, oh, and she looks like she's smiling when she has her mouth wide open while breathing. 
* bringing her to social events. This doesn't mean she gets free run to say hello to everyone, or even that she is off leash, or even that we're in 50 feet of the event. Sometimes Id go to a street festival or fireworks and I would sit BLOCKS away from the people before she became accustomed to crowds, etc. I take her to cafes, I walk her downtown. People stop to pet her, she gets a lot of love, I feel good about myself for basically doing nothing (nothing better then an ego boost by a kid saying ""what a cute dog!"")
* massages and touching. As a person, I feel like I have bonded with my dog when I can touch her and she doesn't run away. This helps me feel confident about my dog because the more she is handled by me (even if she doesn't always enjoy it), the more secure I am with other people handling her. A kid could come and poke her in the eye and I know she would do nothing, because I have worked with her so much. Massages, scratches, etc, i can see when she gets a benefit from them, from others or me. Its great. Its nice to see she is happy and I feel like this is something 'good pet owners' can provide that really requires little stress on either end



Good owners know their dogs wants, needs, boundaries, limitations. A good owner can have a very ""bad""(ly perceived) dog. I have seen several good owners that have dogs who have...killed cats, will never be child friendly dogs, will never be dog friendly dogs, but they know how to give the dogs fulfilling and healthy and happy lives within those boundaries. 


Working with physical trainers will get you on the right page whether or not your (appropriate and positive sounding) training methods are being communicated to your puppy properly, or if your puppy is missing something that is causing it to become excitable at inappropriate times. The thing I found I had to remember was *you can always teach your dog*, you can always work with your dog, its never a dead end.

Want to work faster? Have more concentration? Want to use the same, FDA approved medicine your grandparents used? Caffeine. It works. Need a morning boost? Coffee. Need a mid-day slump boost? Your favorite soda is waiting! Also, do you get headaches or migraines? We pair caffeine with aspirin to make everything better! Stay ahead of the class, office, and competition - Caffeine. 

Objective:
Caffeine is absorbed and passes quickly into the brain. It does not collect in the bloodstream or get stored in the body. It leaves the body in the urine many hours after it has been consumed.

There is no nutritional need for caffeine. It can be avoided in the diet. Caffeine stimulates, or excites, the brain and nervous system.

Caffeine can lead to:

    A fast heart rate
    Anxiety
    Depression
    Difficulty sleeping
    Nausea
    Restlessness
    Tremors
    Urinating more often
    Vomiting 

Stopping caffeine suddenly may cause withdrawal symptoms. These may include:

    Drowsiness
    Headaches
    Irritability
    Nausea
    Vomiting 

There has been much research on the health effects of caffeine.

    Large amounts of caffeine may stop the absorption of calcium and cause lead to thinning bones (osteoporosis).
    Caffeine may lead to painful, lumpy breasts (fibrocystic disease).

Caffeine may harm a child's nutrition if drinks with caffeine replace healthy drinks such as milk. Caffeine cuts down on appetite so a child who consumes caffeine may eat less. The United States has not developed guidelines for caffeine intake and children. 

Moderate tea or coffee drinking is not likely to be harmful to your health as long as you have other good health habits.

    Two to three 8 oz. cups of brewed or drip coffee (about 200 to 300 mg of caffeine) per day and 5 servings of caffeinated soft drinks or tea is an average or moderate amount of caffeine for most people. (However, it should be noted that 5 servings of regular soft drinks is over 700 calories and can contribute to obesity.)
    Ten 8 oz. cups of coffee per day is considered excessive intake of caffeine. ",3,dmdrmr,True,t3_2dreeo,0,cjtozcc,0,1435302796,
0,Dirty Foreigner here to steal your stilts.,t1_cjtjovy,1,1408369007,,t1_cjtirop,False,Scotland,False,,t5_2qkli,"&gt; the argument against an independent Scotland on this point is that when the price is low or it runs out you'd have a much bigger partner in the form of the UK to make up for it; whereas in an independent Scotland you would have to literally start gouging public services and the welfare state to avoid going under.

The argument against *THAT* is that (hopefully) an independent Scotland will invest in such a way that the (eventual) disappearance of oil revenues will not have such a massive impact. Look at how devastated communities were (and still are) where the coal mines or other industry has vanished. The UK does *not* have a great track record in protecting communities once their industry or resource has ""run out"". 

&gt;which is why I don't understand why Yes people don't focus on that rather than a dumb game of ""I don't want to subsidise those English scroungers with my beautiful black stuff!""

I completely agree, although I think you might be overplaying how many people are using that argument. I am not saying I've never heard it, but I have heard the argument that money can be better spent a LOT more. Not better spent as in ""not spent on the English"", but better spent as in ""Spent on what *we* need up here"". The difference may be semantic, but it's still a fundamental difference. 

&gt;I've seen absolutely no evidence that it'd be different in an independent Scotland

I have. Look at things like the Common Weal, (which was unanimously supported at the last SNP conference), look at how often they DO talk about inequalites in our society. Again, as I said, I am not naive, and I know that a lot of what is said will never come to pass, but there's still a pretty good chance they'll try, and a (maybe smaller) chance they'll succeed in making a genuinely different kind of society. 

And your point about tax; Yes, they are talking about a cut to corporation tax. But cutting a tax to boost growth is very different from selling off services to multinational corporations for purely ideological reasons. I have no problem with a cut to corporation tax as long as a) we actually try to *collect* the taxes we are owed, and b) those increased revenues are spent in ways to actually improve society. 

We're clearly not going to agree on a lot here, but I do think we actually agree on more than we care to admit. I think I am just a bit more optimistic about what Scotland can do, and a little more pessimistic about what Westminster is up to. :)

The volatile nature of methane should mean that the engines could be very quick starting and deep cycling, like hypergolics. Lighting using spark gaps or UV lasers, shining through emerald windows, could give reliable ignition at all power levels. All this means that non-toxic, higher ISP thrusters may be a side benefit of methalox engine development.

I find it very hard to believe that the Raptor engine will be developed without 2 smaller engines being developed first. You need to prove certain bits of engineering, like ignition systems, on a thruster-sized engine. Then you need to scale up to about 100 times the thrust, to test things like turbopumps and nozzle cooling. Finally, when you have done all of this groundwork and collected all of this engineering data, you can design a really big engine with some confidence.

Even if SpaceX does go with methane/oxygen for all propulsion on the MCT, that plan could change if the engineering tests do not show the needed performance, for thrusters, for small landing engines, and for large booster engines. But I think we will soon find that methane is a very versatile and safe fuel, and people soon will wonder why no serious attempt to develop them was made since the 1920s, when they were first proposed.

Edit: reentry speculation: I think a very large heat shield will be assembled during the journey to Mars. Pica-X tiles will be brought, and attached to an inflated, foam filled backing plate. I think the heat shield will be ejected (or simply blown to bits) at around 2x the speed of sound, and propulsive landing will be used from that point.",3,peterabbit456,True,t3_2dtuhp,0,cjtafnz,0,1435294130,

Green is far deeper than just big stompy.

What are you using all of that green for? Just to ramp? Some sort of combo? It's certainly your preference what type of deck you want to play, but I've seen very few EDH decks, especially green ones, without a reasonable density of fatties. 

If you're playing lots of small creatures, you still have regal force, glimpse of nature, collective unconscious, and multiple creature-cantrips, some of which (masked admirers) are reusable. And if you have any sort of P/T boost or large creature that works well with hordes (coat of arms or lords in a tribal deck, scion of the wild effects, avenger of zendikar, craterhoof behemoth, gaea's anthem, hunter's prowess, etc.) you can still make use of draw spells reliant on fat creatures. 

&gt; I get the feeling we have very different local metas from one another.

Possible. 

&gt; Soul's Majesty, for example, is trivially countered by any color other than, perhaps, green, because creature removal can make the whole spell fizzle. 

Most creature decks I've seen run some form of protection--in green, most likely hexproof. 

&gt; In a meta with a decent amount of removal, it should almost never be drawing you more than 3 cards unless your opponents are having bad luck or playing poorly. 

In my experience, the sort of decks that play cards like soul's majesty have multiple redundancies in card-drawn. Also, any of the sacrifice cards ignore removal. Zegana, Blue Sun's Zenith, Garruk, etc. Using a removal spell to stop one card draw spell might slow them down a turn. On the other hand, when someone hits an insta-win combo or is about to kill you, path or swords might be the only thing stopping you from losing outright. Those examples are not completely representative, but I think it's going to be far better than something like sign in blood 99% of the time. ",2,viking_,True,t3_2dsbjt,0,cjt9vqf,0,1435293911,

story is way too long and drawn out. before you can do any dungeon, you have to do some crazy quest that involves going around the entire game world. wouldnt be so bad if bird flying was fun. there is also a ton of talking, more than any other story based zelda. it literally took me 5 hours just to get to the first dungeon because of cutscenes and one quest that had me go around and find animals.

not enough variety in enviroments (there are only 3), but they are detailed at least. lots of references and features from other zeldas are used, which isnt too bad, but they are made terrible. flying on a bird is not as fun as it should be (you can only land on certain islands, others you just slide off. definitely not like windwaker, where you can go anywhere). they also brought back the tears of light (name and all) in this game, but they are much later, and a little more concentrated. they are also more of a stealth mission this time, which made it slightly more fun and less tedious than in TP. 

i mentioned flying earlier. its really bad. the skyloft section is small, and the islands aren't that varied. it takes forever to fly anywhere, even with the booster rings placed around the world. one thing you will be doing often is making trips to skyloft to get potions. i have said ""fuck it"" so many times to this because just flying from skyloft to the overworld portals was too tedious. trust me, if you have seen the complaints about windwaker sailing, thats nothing compared to this. 

another thing you will be doing just about all the time is dowsing. basically, its like a quest marker, except you can only see the quest markers while the screen is purple, and your wiimote buzzes more than a vibrator and you listen to some sonar system. its annoying, hardly fun, but required all the time because finding a lot of the shit you need is almost impossible without it. 

also fuck fi. at least with navi you dont have to talk to her every 5 seconds, the boat only bothers you for plot points, and midna only cared to talk when you are in wolf form. fi talks to you whenever you do something quest related or otherwise. half the puzzles in the game arent puzzles because fi tells you what to do, even on new game plus (a mode that you unlock AFTER YOU BEAT THE GAME). 

overall, it is not a fun zelda. certainly not cdi bad, and id say it was more fun than TP (though barely. the dungeons, when fi shuts up, are great and challenging. the final dungeon is probably my favourite. i do love how items you get throughout the game are actually useful the whole way through, and the upgrades you get are worthwhile), but its really not that good. i beat it, but it took me ages because it just felt so tedious and repetitive. i havent really ever 100% a zelda game, but if i ever do, SS will be at the bottom of the list. too much stuff to collect that isnt fun because you have to use the stupid dowsing feature to actually find any of it. overall, the idea of the story is great, and a few of the characters are nice (there is a good reason why groose is so popular, but it is a bit spoilery). it was really cool to have an entire game basically be an origin story for every other zelda. the plot could have been condensed a bit, thats all.

**Control room, the TARDIS**

The Eleventh Doctor had recently sorted out that business with two of his past incarnations, and was travelling alone for a bit. Nothing much was happening in time and space at the time, so he decided, 'What the hell, let's go have some fun!' He set the controls to random and would see where he ended up. The result would be an universe he would not expect...

**the skies above an Earth-like world**

Things were peaceful. Birds flying, a light breeze, no killer robots or giant battleships around. It had been a while since the last thing of note, something about some sort of amusement park? Anyway, the peace was shattered by a grinding sound...

'**VWORP... VWORP... VWORP... VWORP... VWORP....**'

 A blue box materialised. Because this was not the proper place for such a box to be, it fell towards the ground

**TARDIS control room**

""Nice going, you got us lost!"" The Doctor spoke angrily. The TARDIS was unable to make sense of the coordinates. Visual scans showed unusual geology, including some sort of loops made of stone. This might be worth checking out!

**[Green Hill Zone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqRLeh4ZgD0)**

 The ground was just as peaceful as the sky. No killer robots, plants and animals just making the most of the environment, and what extra wind there was was generated by the passing of none other than world-renowned hero, Sonic the Hedgehog. A cloud of dust was being kicked up because of how quickly he was moving. Then a blue box fell out of the sky. Sonic noticed, and felt he just had to check it out. So he ran towards where it fell. Despite it falling from a great height, it seemed completely undamaged, but it was on its side. Words were visible along the top; ""Police public call box"". The door, which was partially blocked by the ground, opened...

""Land on the ground next time!"", a voice came from inside. Sonic looked through the open door, and saw an impossibly large space inside, as well as a man hanging from a railing near it. He was trying to reach for the door's frame, but couldn't quite reach it. Sonic, being the upstanding hero that he was, extended a large gloved hand for the man to grab. Once he did, Sonic pulled him out.

""Thank you. I have got to reconfigure things so that it is simple to get out if it doesn't land properly"", the man said. The most notable feature of his clothing was a bowtie. Then he noticed the exact nature of who had pulled him out. ""I've not seen your species before. I'm The Doctor. Who are you?"" Someone who DIDN'T know of Sonic? Just who WAS he?
 Sonic was quick to strike a pose, balancing on one foot with one finger raised.

""I'm Sonic"", he said. ""Sonic the Hedgehog!""

Introductions made, The Doctor made it clear what he was doing there, and the two managed to reorient the blue box - the TARDIS - properly. Since nothing was happening for either of them, Sonic agreed to come along. The randomised coordinates were set again, and the TARDIS dematerialised from Green Hill Zone...

**[Misty Lake, Gensokyo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWv1yRDCN18)**

It was as peaceful by the Misty Lake as it ever could be with fairies involved. They were playing around, magical bullets and the occasional shard of ice flying. They were passing the time with danmaku duels, which were not much to look at when the strongest fairy, the ice fairy Cirno, wasn't involved. This was disrupted by a grinding sound; **VWORP.. VWORP.. VWORP.. VWORP.. VWORP..** A blue box appeared. Many of the fairies backed away at this, as something like that had to be the work of a powerful youkai. Not Cirno, though. She instead flew towards it and, seeing it was some kind of box, tried to get inside. She pushed at the door, and fell in as they opened. She saw a human and a strange blue creature staring down at her. She didn't even take note of the difference between inside and outside.

""How dare you intrude upon my territory?"" She asked.

""Your territory? A total accident"", the human said.

Cirno got to her feet and then started flying. She wasn't happy.

""You enter my territory by mistake, not knowing who it belongs to? **NOT KNOWING ABOUT THE STRONGEST!?**"" Ice started forming at her fingertips, and the doors closed.

""Hey, chill out!"" The blue creature said. It wasn't afraid of her? Cirno proceeded to fling a quick spray of icicles towards the two. They did no real damage, except one hit a button on the hexagonal thing in the centre. The area began to shake...

""Activating the TARDIS without setting any coordinates? We could end up anywhere. What heve you done, you idiot!?"" The man said, trying to get to the hexagonal thing, being thrown around by particularly strong vibrations. The blue creature, however, seemed to be well balanced and got there without issue.

""Doctor, what should I do?"" it asked.

""Ah, well, pull that lever, Sonic, it should bring the TARDIS to an emergency stop!""

**[The fields of Alternia, at night](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7ZUxyLyIao)**

Night, on Alternia. The young trolls of ten of the eleven colours on the haemospectrum came out at this time. And one of them, a cheerful cat-themed troll by the name of Nepeta Leijon, was out hunting.  In particular, she was hunting a persistent black howlbeast, a wolf-like creature that had evaded her for the past several nights, now. She had tracked it to its den, and was preparing to utilise her Tacklepounce technique to pin it down, when...

**VWORP.. VWORORP... VWORORORP.** A blue box materialised around her, leaving her in a large space. Three others were in that space, arguing.

""I AM NOT AN IDIOT! YOU SHOULD BE AWARE WHEN YOU ENTER THE GREAT CIRNO'S TERRITORY!""

""You activated the TARDIS without even knowing hat could happen. If I hadn't had someone else in here to activate the emergency stop, who knows where or when we could have ended up! As it is the scanner's not working so I have absolutely no idea anyway!""

""If I had known that an adventure was coming, I would have let Tails know. Let's just get this sorted out quickly, right guys?""

The pink-skinned being in the blue dress said ""no"" at the same time as the other said ""yes"". Nepeta decided to move at this point. All three noticed.

""It seems we've picked up someone as we landed"", the one who was talking about some 'TARDIS' thing said.

""Someone else in my territory!?"" The one who called herself Cirno said. A sword of ice formed in her hand, and she flew towards Nepeta, who prepared to Tacklepounce.

""We're not in any 'territory' right now. Chill out, guys!"" The blue creature had gotten between Cirno and Nepeta, one large gloved hand holding each of their wrists. He was fast! He then turned to face Nepeta.

""Do you have any idea where we are?"" he asked.

"":33&lt; Alternia"", Nepeta replied. "":33&lt; Who are you?"".

Introductions were made.

""Welcome to the TARDIS, Nepeta. It's been a while since this many beings have been in it at the same time. Let's explore the universe, and I'll get all three of you back to your home times and places quickly."" Saying this, The Doctor activated the TARDIS again. Little did they know there were heading to a place robot armies attacked next...

**[Mann Co. Mercs' quarters, 5 days since Gray Mann's first attack.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDM2qukzKwg)**

""SO MUCH MONEY!"" A large Russian man, the Heavy Weapons Guy, said. It had been a profitable day killing robots for the mixed mercs of the RED and BLU teams.

""Mm mm mm!"" The 'mumbling abomination' known only as the Pyro mumbled through its mask.

Suddenly, the door opened and the Spy walked in.

""Gentlemen,"" he said, pulling from a cigarette, ""We seem to have unwanted company nearby. Some sort of blue box. Demoman, this should be a simple task for you.""

Tavish DeGroot, the Demoman, wasn't happy at being singled out for this task. ""[BLEEP] you, Spy. Just because ah'm nae useful all the time doesnae mean ah have to do this.""

""I'll pay you some of my share for this."" The Spy responded. Money is an universal language for the mercs.

""Ach, fine"", the Demoman said, picking up his Grenade Launcher and the Eyelander as he headed for the door. ""Let's go collect some bloody heads, Eyelander!""

**Inside the TARDIS**

The four unlikely acquaintances were getting the scanners up and running again. Well, Sonic and The Doctor were. Nepeta was keeping Cirno occupied, talking about their respective worlds. Suddenly, an impact rocked the place.

""That was some sort of explosion against the outside! Almost got it- THERE!"" The scanners came online, and showed a dark-skinned man firing grenades at the TARDIS. The Doctor, thinking quickly, decided to open the door and use the Sonic Screwdriver to jam it. The man pulled out a claymore and charged the door. Just to be knocked to the floor by a combined Tacklepounce and Boost from Nepeta and Sonic respectively. The two pulled him inside, Sonic making sure to take the sword and keep it somewhere safe.

The man explained who he was and what he was doing, and the five set off. They nearly had enough to serve as a proper TARDIS crew now...

**[Somewhere in the ocean, Kurogane bridge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r8b3NqevME)**

A blue box suddenly appeared, surprising the men commanding the battleship. It happened to materialise around one of them, specifically the one giving direct orders to the crew, one Elzam von Branstein. This was twice now that the TARDIS had materialised around someone in the past hour or so. Elzam was actually the most calm of those to recently be in the TARDIS, even more so than the Doctor himself...

Asks that peaceful protesters come during daytime for their safety, though they have the right to come at night, so that police can collect the small minority of criminals who have come from as far as New York and California. Media asked to clear streets and not conflict with police action. Media also asked to not glamorize criminals. No journalists were apparently arrested tonight, though police may take some into custody in the midst of chaos due to not realizing who is a journalist or not - they are released.

Most can be found in the game's story mode, but some need to be found in the game's Adventure mode, which is essentially a challenge mode of sorts.
* **Badges** - Badges boost your character's abilities (ex. increasing your Musou gauge, giving a weapon additional combo moves, giving you more empty bottles, etc.), and in order to craft them you need to gather materials from fallen enemies.
* **Leveling up** - You level up in the game by defeating enemies or spending Rupees in the Training Dojo, and leveling increases your stats. Absolutely necessary for tackling some of the much harder difficulties.

So the secret is to show excitement even if it seems boring to you. 

Here are some ideas i got from google :


12 to 16 months

Coming to life
Pretend your child's favorite teddy or doll is real—make him walk, go to bed, or dance around the room. Include him in everyday activities—sitting him at the table for dinner, for example, and putting a bib on him. Talking about what you're doing helps your toddler with her language skills. Act out happy and sad times so she can learn about feelings and emotions as she's developing her imagination.

Push me, pull you
If your toddler is pulling himself up and trying to walk, help him practice with a pushing and pulling game. Use a moveable object such as a child-size chair or plastic stacking box filled with soft toys. While he holds the edges for support, you can hold the other side and keep it steady. Then slowly pull the box toward you to encourage him to step forward. Soon he'll start to push while you gently pull. This will build his confidence for the day he finally walks on his own.

Clap happy
By now your toddler can hold her hands open, but it may be a while before she claps independently. For now, clap them together for her, or let her hold your hands while you pat them together. Sit her facing you on the floor or on your lap and sing clapping songs like patty-cake. These will boost her language skills as well as her hand-eye coordination.

Who's hiding here?
Just as he loved peekaboo as a baby, your toddler will love to play simple games of hide-and-seek. First thing in the morning, take turns hiding under the bedsheets. At bath time, use a big towel. For extra fun and giggles, you can gently prod him when he's hiding. Say something like, ""Hmm, is this a leg? Or is it an arm?""

Games like this show your toddler that just because he can't see something, that doesn't mean it isn't there. For a change, carry him into another room while he's wrapped up in the towel. He'll be delighted when he pops his head out to discover he's in a new spot.

The magic of sound
Word play increases your child's awareness of sounds and gives her the confidence to try out new words. From books that mimic car sounds to farm animals that moo and cockadoodledoo, there's no shortage of toys that can ignite your child's imagination through sound. Playing games that repeat certain sounds, reading nursery rhymes out loud, and experimenting with different tones and rhythms are other ways you can help your toddler develop language skills—and have fun while she's at it.

16 to 20 months

Tea party
On a sunny day, take a child-size plastic tea set outside and fill a large plastic bowl with water. Pretend you've ""come to tea"" and have your toddler fill the teapot and pour the tea. Don't expect a dainty tea party—it's likely to be a watery mess. But this fun game will challenge his coordination and he'll be fascinated with the properties of water—for example, that it always flows down, not up.

Block patterns
This requires some concentration on your toddler's part, so it's best played when she's feeling refreshed. Use building blocks to make simple patterns, such as three in a row or ""two up, two down"" to make a square. Show her how to copy your pattern using other blocks. Then let her come up with her own pattern, which you have to copy. Sorting objects like this into shapes helps your toddler develop problem-solving skills.

Roll it to me
Balls are popular toys for toddlers. Bouncy balls are best kept outside, but soft, foam balls make great indoor toys. Keep a close eye on your child when he's using these—some curious toddlers like to see what they taste like.

The best ball game to start playing with your toddler is an easy version of ""catch."" Both of you sit on the ground facing each other with your legs apart and toes touching. You can now roll the ball back and forth to each other without it going out of bounds. Fun for building arm muscle strength and hand-eye coordination.

Young collector
Go for a walk together and take a bucket with you. Collect small objects that interest your toddler, like stones, leaves, and pinecones. Your toddler will want to carry the bucket, but don't be surprised if she also dumps its contents and starts again. Toddlers this age love to fill containers just so they can empty them again. Meanwhile, she's practicing her hand movements and developing dexterity.

20 to 24 months

Let's dance!
Play favorite songs that could inspire your child to do specific actions—something with a loud, strong beat so he can stamp like an elephant, or something quiet so he can pretend he's tiptoeing past a sleeping lion. Marching to music is also great fun and easy enough for most toddlers to manage. These games stretch his imagination and develop his sense of rhythm.

Balloon fun
Balloons are great for indoor play—they move slowly enough to be chased and are relatively easy to catch. Blow one up and tap it gently into the air. Count how long it takes to float to the ground or let your toddler try to catch it. A good game for introducing numbers and counting and strengthening hand-eye coordination.

Note of caution: Uninflated latex balloons are a serious choking hazard for children. So are balloons in broken pieces. Inflated balloons are okay, but supervise your toddler closely and take away broken pieces immediately if the balloon pops. If possible, choose mylar balloons instead.

What can you hear?
Take a big towel or blanket out into the garden and lie down on it together. Ask your toddler to close his eyes and listen carefully. After a minute or so ask him what he could hear, and tell him what you heard—the wind in the trees, a bird singing, a car driving past. This is a great game for helping your toddler develop his listening and descriptive skills.

Catch me if you can
Toddlers love to be chased, the object of this game is for your child to be caught, especially if she knows she gets a big bear hug and tickles every time you manage to catch her. For variety, pretend to be different types of animals, like a roaring lion or a scuttling mouse. A great game for building up your toddler's stamina – and yours!

3. Costco, perhaps? It's a bit different because it's a large store, but you could compare it to Sam's Club (also owned by Walmart) which also sells in a similar fashion but pays its workers much less. 
4. [The average internet speed as measured in this report in the United States is 8.7Mbps](http://www.akamai.com/dl/documents/akamai_soti_q213.pdf?WT.mc_id=soti_Q213). I thought it was a bit lower (it's apparently been increasing quite a bit in the last few years), but that's still not enough to stream [3D or 4K](http://hometheater.about.com/od/internethometheater2/a/Internet-Speed-for-Netflix-Vudu.htm) and that's just for the person watching. I can't find a good source for the global upload rate, but in most cases you're looking at somewhere around a 8:1 download:upload comparison. I have no source for this, just going off of what is typically offered. If all you can upload at is 1Mbps, any video conferencing will be in fairly low resolution. Keep in mind that typically these internet connections cannot run fully in both directions... so if you are using 1Mbps out of 1.5Mbps total upload, you'll cap out at 33% of your max download. I'm going to move the discussion about big data and cell phones to a new number at the bottom, as it deserves it's own section. 
5. While both can be doing great, there's no reason they should be so disparate. Social security is an investment, but we aren't funding it so it will collapse. As for inflow vs. outflow, I see no reason why we cannot increase the taxes on corporations and the wealthy, and offset it by incentivizing them (tax credits, deductions, etc.) to grow the bottom. There's a disparity between the top 50% and bottom 50% so if you can get the math right, there's no reason this alone couldn't help fix it. Of course, this requires that the top 50% (really I'd say focusing on large businesses would be the best way to do this, as many of them game the system and pay very little in taxes anyhow) are compliant to some degree... if they all refuse to take advantage of the incentives, then all we'd end up doing is shifting over to entitlement which would be bad. 
6. Look I'm not saying it's the end of the world. I just find it disconcerting that there's a gap and it's widening. 
7. Let me explain this a little better before I address what you brought up. Ideally, what I'd like to see, is investment in infrastructure and a growth of wages. The problem is, it's practically pulling teeth to get people to invest in this manner. You can't fund infrastructure with taxes, because people would rather put their money elsewhere. So the idea would be that through tax incentives, to make people invest in infrastructure and wages. From a corporate perspective, they could continue to pay roughly the same taxes as they are, if and only if they put a reasonable amount of their earnings into increasing wages and investing in infrastructure. That way, instead a huge percentage of their earnings going to the executive level and shareholders (if publicly owned), much of it goes back into the workers hands who are presumably primarily of the bottom 50% (obviously this depends on the kind of company and their salaries). This would grow jobs and grow the tax base. On the individual side, I'm not sure at this point what the best move would be, but likely it would stay very similar to how it is at this time. If you can think of a good way to accomplish something similar with individual taxes (somehow incentivize them to create jobs... perhaps tax credits for hiring house cleaners, gardeners, etc.? IDK), then that would work. I'm aware that blindly raising taxes is not a good idea. I want to assure you that it's not my point or intention. 
8. That source looks at average return over time. If you had the cash to buy a house outright, you would be paying very little into nothing. If you rent, you are essentially giving that money away. I'm sorry but less money getting paid into nothing is definitively better than more money getting paid into nothing. We are talking about it in this perspective, because there's no good reason why homes should be a scarcity. [There are countries that are far less well off than we are, with higher home ownership rates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_home_ownership_rate). If anything this is proof that scarcity is artificially created in order for someone to make a profit. I don't like this, because a home should be a right. Sure, if you want to make luxury homes expensive, or homes in certain desirable areas; that's fine. But when you have a young base who wants to own homes but cannot because they aren't paid well enough because Walmart would rather pay it's rich share holders their profits than investing in better wages, I take issue with that. 
9. Poor have more kids, rich have more homes. From the macro perspective, I suppose it matters less. I'll have to rethink this question later. 
10. The reason I brought up big data, is that our devices are becoming more and more connected. And there's real benefit to be had, from collecting this data and providing a service of some sort. Examples include apps that track where you parked your car, so you can find it in a large parking lot, apps that automatically notify you when traffic is bad and can automatically suggest alternative routes, smart thermostats that can adjust while you are away (determines location via smartphone, etc.) and more. All of these devices require the ability to send and receive data. The more and more of this we get (truth be told it's hard to nail down how much upload/download is required or what we will be leveraging in the future because there are many technologies which haven't been invented yet), the more and more upload and download speed we need. In some cases, researchers have even taken to [requesting](http://folding.stanford.edu/) some of your processing power (and therefore bandwidth as well) or human processing power to assist in research. This also puts a strain on our internet connectivity. Stores are using more and more data to assist in shopping, preventing identity theft, fraud, etc. There are countless possibilities for how to leverage data and one of the biggest companies in the world is all about crunching extremely large data sets and seeing what they can get out of it (Google). 
11. It's interesting that you mention cell phones, and I can assure you that link is using questionable or outdated data. Ookla has the United States as [25th](http://explorer.netindex.com/maps?country=United%20States) in the world for mobile internet speeds (make sure to click mobile after you click the link). [This 2014 report](http://opensignal.com/reports/state-of-lte-q1-2014/) has the US looking better, but far from second in the world. In fact, I can assure you that most [Asian countries and many in Europe](http://www.akamai.com/dl/akamai/akamai-soti-q114.pdf?WT.mc_id=soti_Q114) have significantly faster mobile speeds than we do. South Korea in particular is well known because it's going to be the first country to roll out a 4G-LTE that's a lot closer to the [standard's max](http://www.engadget.com/2014/01/20/sk-telecom-lte-a-300-mbps/) than any other country. Ironically, it wouldn't surprise me if wireless forms of internet overtake wired, as companies which have started to take advantage of [10GHz+ ranges](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/02/12/google-10-gigabit-internet-speeds/5421709/) to deliver gigabit+ speed internet. In fact, there's a [provider in the SF area](http://webpass.net/) that already leverages the high frequency spectrum to deliver 50-200mbps internet wirelessly. 

&gt;Maybe not every time, but in the last two posts you've provided none, so maybe somewhere in the middle?

Sure. Feel free to call me out on something if you want to see a source. 

&gt;You said wages are stagnant and they aren't. You then moved the goal post by saying compared to the rich, and thus changed the scope. 

Depends on your definition of stagnant, but yes, I did also compare it to the rich and changed the scope. 

&gt;Boosts have externalities. 

There's way too many confounding factors for me to believe that correlation is a causation. No other period of time than the housing bubble were loans given out so wantonly and them getting packaged together and sold to offload risk was a huge contributor as well. 

There just needs to be appropriate oversight of banks and loans. Banks especially, given that we got rid of the glass-steagall act. ",1,Gaywallet,True,t3_2dfo2z,0,cjs2j7l,0,1435269850,

At Ra70/Gu70, you can equip any weapon you might want in all of the ranged categories except for Bullet Bows. You might want to get your hands on the Bio Series weapons that are the rewards for collecting Extreme Quest stones, considering that they've got the best potential among all 11-stars in nearly all weapon categories (some would say Zero Effort on the Helen Trager is the best in the TMG category, I think the point's up for debate).

 Bio Fanger, Bio Triner and Bio Spat are all fantastic guns. At Lv.3 Potential, they all get 7% bonuses to Just Attacks. If you want, you can swap Bio Spat for Nemethybren for it's 11% boost to Standing Snipe, since most Launcher PA's cause you to become stationary anyway.

 As far as a decent Ra/Gu combo pre-Ep3 goes, try this: http://pso2-skill.pwnedgalaxy.net/skillcalc.php?07fbsIkbsIkbsIkbsIkbsIkbsIkbsIk0lbIn00000000Ib000000jdBJhJ29k2Nfqn0000lb2XaScFjGAgBbp0000ib0000000Ib0000000Ib000000j

 Why did I take Just Reversal on Ranger? Nothing else to spend the points on, everyone should use Tech Recovery (I'm using a term from fighting games when I say 'tech', which is to use a button to recover from flying or being knocked away). Weak Bullet is essential, both classes can spare the single point for 10-star weapon mastery (but never more than that single point because the boost per level falls off a cliff). Zero Range Advance is great for Gunners, but if you like to get up close and personal with your Launcher then you'll find the Zero Distance PA will get a significant boost from ZRA 1&amp;2.

 As far as Units go, I prefer the Tian set: Rear/Gwanman Rin and Rear/Gwanman En. They are a two-unit Set that grants +90 RATK and +10 PP. Top those off with Leg / Ing Plate, and you're good to go. The 11-star Unit sets, at the time of writing, do not offer PP boosts and have generalized +90 stat effects (to all three attack types, but you don't need that, just an RATK boost), but they have less DEF and add less HP.

 This same build, minus a Launcher, works the same for Gu/Ra or Gu/Hu, but adjust for the absence of a Launcher in your equipment.",0,Edgewood,True,t3_2dp7bw,0,cjrumrn,0,1435265559,

To stop me from buying boosters to crack, I drop around $40 per set on a playset of Commons/Uncommons to prevent impulse purchases.  I also buy one Fat Pack, because I like collecting the boxes, spindown counters, and insert booklets, as well as giving me the satisfaction of opening a few packs.

I am also in the process of purchasing a handful of packs of each set that comes out for the purposes of using with Stocking Tiger, Booster Tutor, and/or Lore Seeker (the former two in EDH decks (with opponents' permission) and the latter in my Conspiracy Cube).

I purchase cheap singles for decks but since I don't play competitively I generally don't buy anything over $1.

so many things, dont even know where to start..
1)GEMS
 6L gems: **reasonable aoe dps**:
ground slam + faster attacks + multistrike + melee phys. dmg + add. fire + endurance charge on stun
everything will be stunned including double map bosses except for hard bosses like dominus
                **single target hard stun dps**:
heavy strike + FA + multi + melee phys + stun + add fire

now piety, dominus, anything except unwavering will be stunned locked.
basicaly you switch Heavy S. with ground slam for that boss kill.
forget blood magic, i never had mana problems running those gems, unless you use voidhomme.
forget weapon elemental dmg,conc. eff.,inc. aoe., just not worth it.
conc. eff. criples skill too much, inc aoe = wasted gem, wpn. ele. dmg too low of a boost.
WHY USE ENDURANCE CHARGE ON STUN? because you use CWDT(lvl3) + IC(lvl5) + INC. DURATION and get permanent phys. dmg immunity. 

2)gear: marohi is very nice, but a high roll Piledriver couldve more dps.
basically all you need is 2h mace with pure phys + atk speed on it.

3)tree:
you collect nodes and travel very inaffectively. a build, thats immune to phys dmg, and stuns evrything on map doesnt need that much life, you need capped resists tho and grace+IR to act as a buffer before IC kicks in. 
your tree 114 pts: only 60% inc. stun duration, +183% life, low attack speed.. you can make calculations yourself, because im adding my tree

2. Both are important. I'm not sure what else to talk about here? It sounds like you are in agreement? 
3. When I say ""making enough"", I'm comparing it to similar companies - companies which provide the same service, but pay their employees better. If it's possible for others to do, I'd argue it's possible for them as well. Perhaps not the *same*, but better. 
4. Internet infrastructure is government controlled in other countries. In all honesty, it should be here too, but we have a unique history. No, you can't stream movies instantly with most internet connections in this country, especially so at a high resolution. More importantly, however, is that data sharing is becoming extremely important for business and home. I'll admit I'm a bit biased here (I work in big data), but if anything it gives me a good perspective on what kind of data is getting collected and what people are doing with it. We are not set up for what's coming.
5. I don't know. I didn't say I had all the answers. But when the bottom 50% isn't growing as fast as the top, this sounds to me like we need to invest in the bottom. Entitlement isn't an investment - we need to give them jobs so that they don't need entitlement. EITC would be one good way to help reinvest in the bottom. 
6. Because if they had the money for *both* it'd be factually better. 
7. Growing the tax base would help lower entitlement spending because you'd have more people who are less reliant on entitlements. It's really apples for apples, when you think of it in the macroscopic perspective (either it has to be collected from increased taxes on the wealthy, or we incentivize the wealthy to reinvest in creating jobs to grow the tax base), but it sits easier with everyone if people are at least working.
8. I'm not assuming buying a home is best. I'm saying consider a theoretical perspective where buying a home is the best choice for a person. Then take the logic through. You cannot take their income into consideration when you are thinking of this from a ""what could be better?"" perspective. If you did, you could theoretically have a system where no one has enough money to buy a home and clearly everyone permanently renting is not a solution because no one is allowed to accrue capital and must instead throw their money into nothing. 
9. I'm splitting apart the home/kids explanation because it is a separate discussion. You don't have to have a home for kids, but people tend not to have kids when they are not financially stable. Many people do not consider renting to be financially stable. I'm at work right now and about to leave so I don't have any links, but I would be very surprised if you could find anything that correlated renting with a higher parent percentage than owning a home. 

I get that you are providing plenty of sources and it might be frustrating that I often am not. If there's something I say that you disagree with or want a source for, please say so. 

&gt;The scope of this discussion has changed from stagnant wages(not true)

Wages are more stagnant for the bottom 50% than the top 50% and in general haven't improved a whole lot as compared to other time frames. So no, that's an improper summary of that portion of the discussion. 

&gt; saving economys are bad(not true). 

This was an term mismatch

&gt;To - we need to invest money in infrastructure and student debt is bad because you can't own a home or have kids. This is different.

Yes, but drives at the initial point. The bottom 50% needs a boost. 

&gt;I'm not saying that is bad, but if we're changing the scope of the discussion, we should agree to not hash up past assumptions that are unsupported by evidence. And if we do make assertions, source the underlying evidence.

&amp;nbsp;

For this week’s event, A.R.M.O.R. has returned, along with A.R.M.O.R. Research Drives!

A.R.M.O.R. Research Drives are now dropping from enemies, and Jocasta, as an operative for A.R.M.O.R., has returned to Avengers Tower with additional devices.

Features of the ARMOR Incursion event include:

* **A.R.M.O.R. Research Drives** can now drop from any enemy, with a higher chance from bosses and a bonus stack of 10 Research Drives for the first of each Shared Quest completed each day.

* **A.R.M.O.R. Alternate Reality Chaos Portal**, a new artifact which can summon alternate reality entities to fight for you in addition to boosting the power of any summoned allies you have. This is available from Jocasta in exchange for A.R.M.O.R. Research Drives.

* **ARMORED Cores**: A new unique version of “Strong” Costume Cores (4 affixes) with an additional 1000 Defense affix. These are available from Jocasta in exchange for A.R.M.O.R. Research Drives.

* **A.R.M.O.R. M-26 Anti-Reality Grenade** a new artifact is available as an option for heroes of various builds. These are available from Jocasta in exchange for A.R.M.O.R. Research Drives.

* **A.R.M.O.R. Alternate Reality Relics**: Jocasta sells a box of ten relics in order to give heroes a jumpstart on collecting these. These relicss are also available from any enemy during A.R.M.O.R. Weeks. These relics were collected by Top Men of the A.R.M.O.R. organization and affect the power of summoned allies. Don't look at it, no matter what happens.



The A.R.M.O.R. event will return in the future, with more and more features added to it each month. We have some very big plans for this, just ask Headpool.

We want to focus more on recurring events that have a distinct theme so everyone know what to expect and can plan around it.

**HERO CHANGES**

&amp;nbsp;

**Rocket Raccoon**

* Mechfall’s missile attack has the cooldown removed.

* Mechfall’s missile attack now does bonus damage to elite targets.

* All Mech powers are now tagged as both **Summon** and **Gun** powers, since it's essentially a giant Summoned Walking Gun. All Rocket Raccoon builds will see a damage increase.

&amp;nbsp;

**Star-Lord**

* Improved the animation interrupt window of Star-Lord’s Elemental Blast powers in order to increase responsiveness.

&amp;nbsp;

**Iron Man**

&amp;nbsp;

*(Doomsaw Edit - the previous patch note on this was written terribly, so let me clear it up:)*

* Death From Above had the incorrect tuning flags from last week's Iron Man level 52 review (people tend to not report the favorable tuning tags....). This happens frequently when many powers change.

* The tuning tags are now set correctly, as all powers must be. This, of course, is a ""nerf"" to the damage from the previous bugged tuning numbers, which all Iron Man players will obviously realize.

* As a small change designers have changed the default cooldown of the power to 4 seconds and allowed the cooldown and damage to be increased while Adaptive Armor is on (to 8 seconds and +100% damage).

* Tuning tags are not subjective, they are applied to the same to every hero in the game. So, as much as it sucks to have an OP power fixed to be the same tuning as everything else in the game, there is no option. Sometimes tuning fixes increase damage, sometimes they don't.

* Having said that, after this review, a skilled Iron Man player is pretty insanely powerful from all reports from experienced players, so let's keep things in perspective.

* &lt;3



**BUG FIXES**

&amp;nbsp;

A few bug fixes made it into this patch and a few more may make the final build. All reported bugs are in the tracking system and will be resolved this week or next week.

* Rocket Raccoon - Assault Specialization will no longer cause Rocket to lose stealth after firing M78 Plasma Launcher.

* Spider-Man's Ultimate now gains bonuses from melee damage rating instead of ranged damage rating.

* Ghost Rider - Dread now obeys normal CC rules and can no longer permanently chain CC enemies.

* The Doombot Flyers in X-Defense and the Dr. Doom boss fight have a performance and efficiency upgrade. Encounters involving many of these flyers will now cause less performance issues on lower-end machines.

* Fixed an issue where Durability would sometimes give an extra health per second.

* Fixed an issue where upgrading to Cosmic Insignias when using an unbound insignia with specific affixes would not upgrade that affix. (Six people were affected by this and will be contacted individually by customer service, no tickets are required since we have all the detailed logs).

* Fixed an issue where the Monolith Mini boss on the Surtur fight was enraging very quickly. This is now fixed, and the Monolith has a 4 minute enrage timer (previously it was 3 minutes)

* Fixed an issue where Iron Man would fail to animate while wearing the Nightclub costume.

&amp;nbsp;

**IN DEVELOPMENT**

&amp;nbsp;

* We have a huge amount of stuff in development right now, including several new content pieces, two new game modes, several, quality of life changes and bug fixes, new UI features, new heroes, team-ups, level 52 reviews, costume tweaks, new costumes, and more. I'll try to write a little blog about it this weekend.

Tower wars isn't a  in demand game,  only in demand games should be in your inventory.  The goal should be key collecting at this time for you.  Do not buy the keys with your $9.  Instead look at your games and find out which have trading cards.   Collect those cards and either sell them now or wait till a Steam sale as again people buy cards for games during this time because crafting badges during the events gives extra bonuses. (typically another seasonal card and a bonus item for a game that can be sold for a higher profit)  

Look at game bundles, humble bundle and such with your $9,  try to buy bundles as cheaply as you can if they have trading cards.  You can actually make a profit from such bundles. 

At times Steam will award you booster packs,  Check the current price of cards  vs booster pack cost.  I have sold booster packs for $1.50 for example when the cards would have sold for 9 cents each making a much larger profit.

If you're really up for gambling and own CS:GO buy keys for it and sell any good items you receive,  I managed to get and sell a knife which was a huge profit  but don't expect such results again this is a huge gamble.   Also CS:GO  will easily pay for itself  as the  event boxes that are rewarded from play will sell for quite high when it first comes out.  Even if you don't like CS:GO I highly recommend this investment,  I have made more from the game than the few dollars it cost me while on sale.

Seasonal cards  and cards for new games should be sold ASAP  even if you want to craft the badge once. ( which I like to do) the reason for this is the price of the cards go down drastically fast,  the quicker you sell them the more you will make and could easily buy a entire set and walk away with profits later on.  

When it comes to purchasing games  for yourself weigh your options and only do it during a steam sale.   You have options beyond purchasing on Steam many users will trade  games for keys and you could get a deal.   For example during the last Summer sale I decided to finally get Skyrim.     Skyrim:LE  was like $13  not a bad price right?   Well instead I found someone who accepted 3 keys for Skyrim:LE making my total cost instead $7.50.   Be frugal and patient  and always aim for the best price if you do this correctly your gaming habits can easily become free.

6- I don't understand the question. When do recruits not need yelling? Kidding. They mellow out somewhat after a few weeks if you collectively show some competency and become somewhat likable to them. Cranking it up to 11 all the time drains a person.  

7- There isn't a lot, but generally catching up on what needs doing is a good idea. Fix your rack and uniforms. Study for tests. HELP YOUR SHIPMATES DO THE SAME IF YOU SQUARE YOURSELF AWAY (see 6.)  

8- You get a smattering of time on weekends here and there. You get to visit the recruit little store thingy to get stamps and envelopes at some point.

10- Big stall. It's vaguely awkward but really who cares. Water is lukewarm at best.  

11- Stand around in your mask a while feeling dandy. Take off mask, things get way less dandy and a lot more burn-y. Keep as cool as possible. DO EXACTLY WHAT AND ONLY WHAT THEY SAY such as saying a few words and get out of there the moment they tell you to.  

12- Statistically, they have a few. Statistically, a handful of your class will get pushed back or wash out. If you do not know who the division fuck-up is, it is probably you. ; -)  

13- Yes, you get a paycheck somewhere between E-1 and E-3 depending on if you had any boosts coming to you. Your first batch of uniforms comes out of your first paycheck though, so it won't be big.

say player A and player B are lane opponents at mid. player A spent money and bought ip boosts. player A has a 5 full pages of runes one each for ap runes, ad runes, top runes, jungle runes, and support runes. player B didn't buy ip boosts, and have only the two pages that comes with every account filled with an ap rune page and ad rune page. sure player A has a whole 3 sets of runes more than player B, but in game, it's not like player A has all 5 sets' added bonuses, just the bonus abilities from that one rune page player A locked in during champ select---the same number of rune page player B can lock in. even though player B has less overall total number of runes, in game, since each can only use one set, it doesn't matter if someone like player A has more. where in that do you see an advantage for the person who used money to gain some sort of ""advantage""? 

sure you can argue ""oh what if the player B with only 2 rune pages had to play a different role?"" well, by the time a player hits level 30 they will have a good idea of what role they want to main in league, so having only two rune page is still ok because you can just get one tailored for that role you want to play. ""but what if that player couldn't get the role they wanted?"" That is a great question, with the newly introduced mode you can go join a team that is looking for a player in the role you want to play. also, like i have said many times now, there are rune pages that are pretty much universal and can be used regardless of the lane/role you are playing, so even if you don't get the role you want those two rune page will still be effective. finally, if you really just want to play that one role, you can always dodge, for a normal que it's only like a 5 minute plenty, you can go browse reddit during that time and once que pops again type in ""[insert desired role here]"" faster. 

""but that's not what i'm arguing, i'm saying it takes too long to collect different runes!"" to put it frankly, if by the time a player hits level 30, they cannot fill up the 2 default rune pages then that is totally on them and not the game. considering the fact that you can use the same seals and glyphs for both pages, for a player to save up for 2 pages is very easy. 

""but what about before level 30?"" well the games before level 30 were meant as a learning process for new players. not having any runes or full rune sets at that time is perfectly ok. why? because all you are trying to do from level1-29 is to get to level 30. that period of time is meant for a player to learn the game, choose a favorite role, pick a few champions they really like and learn them. who cares if you start with 3 ad less than your opponent, or 4 MR less, win or lose you are just going to be moving on to the next game regardless. and if you truly are new and not smurfing, people can tell easily, and the community isn't that tough on those players.",1,Bestrice,True,t3_2d7d2k,0,cjquhlx,0,1435247693,

Katanas - Power(1-4), Vol or Quartz Soul, Stamina(1-4), Spirita(1-4), Spirita Boost

Bow - Shoot(1-4), Fang Soul, Stamina(1-4), Spirita(1-4), Spirita Boost

As for your units generally same scheme as above depending on the weapon type you intend to use.

Katanas rely on strike attack for damage, bows ranged. 

Building your mag to suit your play style is important, you can go Dex mag which gives you versatility as far as using both bows and katanas, or go pure katanas which requires a 175 satk mag, pure bow isn't viable in terms of DPS and effectiveness.  A pure satk mag will let you be a good hunter, fighter, katana braver, and soon to come dual blade bouncer.

Regarding COs

Do all of koffies as these will unlock things for you like, your one and only mag, extra weapon slots, difficulty unlocks, new stages, and they all give great exp for a new character.

Hanz - Kill monster quests, gives good xp later on when you unlock his super hard dailies

Franka - collect x amount of drops from target, can start doing these when you unlock hard mode

Xie - event quests, do these usually unrestricted exp so it can be great when you're just beginning they're also daily

Girard - Kill rare form of monster, unlocks once you reach VH

There are other NPCs that have quests that only unlock as you progress story but those are usually 1 time only deals and a waste of time in most cases, and some that will allow you to undertake quests when certain requirements are met like unlocking a certain free field, reaching a certain difficulty, etc.

Spam the limited quest while you have the chance and Emergency quests are both great ways to gain quick XP bare in mind these are grind like methods however.

personally, as someone who quit at start of cata, then rejoined a few months ago, I've noticed that blizz has watered down every class, and removed some abilities that made classes unique. i find most classes just aren't as enjoyable anymore. classes have less abilities/spells, some spells combined with others for max ez mode, and even some fun novelty abilities have been removed. 

my favorite class from classic thru to cata was warlock, but the class just seems stale now. I used to collect souls, create sacrificial rituals to summon almost uncontrollable demons, etc. now i just play a 'dps class' with a different look. I played a paladin for a while, who could sacrifice himself to save someone in need, could create holy auras to boost your allies. now a paladin is just another melee dps class with a different look. I'm surprised they haven't removed shaman totems yet.

i'm guessing they did it to make picking up the game easier, but I find most classes/specs now only have a 3-4 ability rotation, as opposed to the diversity from 4 years ago. i'll try out draenor, but each class has lost it's ""feel"".

I do feel bad for people that DO want secret rares, though, because they deserve better, but poliowraff's anecdote of people tearing packs open and only caring about EX cards pretty much sums it up for me. We just had a new set - Flashfire - that was centered completely around multiple Charizard ultra-rare cards, and yet there wasn't a single Charmander or Charmeleon to appreciate in it because evolved Pokemon can now be basic, somehow. I feel like it would have felt a lot more like a Charizard set if the line was fully present and showed up in every rarity. Get a normal holo Charizard and a rare Charmeleon in there, maybe. It just sometimes feels like the packs might as well have 9 energies and a trainer in them, and 1 out of every 6 packs should have 9 energies and an EX.

When I was a kid and there were no secret rares, there was still Base Charizard which had the same aura and demand as a secret rare, but even then I remember loving most or all of the cards and considered every single one special. Many of my favorite old-school cards aren't hard to find at all - Base/Jungle/Fossil commons and uncommons like Ivysaur, Magnemite, Jigglypuff, and Arbok. I remember being excited when I got Clefairy Doll or Pidgeotto for the first time in boosters, even though they weren't holo, because the card had cool art. But I suppose I can chalk some of that up to being a kid and everything being special back then.

I also feel like the sets made now make some of the individual cards too filler-y, especially when there are multiple cards of the same species in a given set. Back in the original sets, only a very select few Pokemon had more than one card, and the first three sets perfectly rounded up every Pokemon - the planning there was so cool and helped cement those sets as the ""Big Three"" back in the day. Having over a hundred cards in every single set probably hurts it a little, too.

BUT... I'm not a first-generation only guy. I collect all generations of cards, and I've found lots to like. Heck, even I got excited when I pulled a White Kyurem EX in a Legendary Treasures pack I bought on a whim. I'm waiting on a massive trade I just did where I traded some video games for nearly 600 bulk commons from the fourth generation era. Rares are neat and holos are pretty, but I think the common cards deserve some attention, too.

He continues to spends weeks moving up the ranks until five months later, he has finally earned Draco's approval to be an apprentice to Draco. It is at this time that Rann learns of two other apprentices Draco has. The other apprentices see Rann as challenges to their status. However, upon receiving the promotion in front of the other two, Rann makes it clear to Draco that Rann is out to replace Draco--further alienating the two apprentices. Draco jokes about those same words being said back at the academy confrontation. Rann quickly replies ""and remember what happened to you then? That confrontation did not weaken me one bit, unlike it did to you."" Draco gets serious immediately with a scorning stare at Rann, replying, ""If you truly wish to be the master, than you'll need to learn to back up those words and prove yourself stronger than my other apprentices. Fail and I shall see how powerless those words are."" Rann ignites his lightsaber, ready to make moves at the two apprentices. But Draco speaks before actions happen futher, ""Be steady my new apprentice. Now is not the time for my apprentices to quarry amongst each other for power. That will be after my grand unveiling of the new Imperial super weapon. I need each of you to prove yourself against an enemy that will no doubt strike soon."" Draco begins laying out his future plans before his three apprentices.
H473 is given rank to be head of any armed forces Rann is assigned. H473 oversees many of Rann's combat assignments. While not in combat, H473 begins to dig through the Imperial inteligence for more Project Sarlacc information. He uncovers many projects over the next five months before he finally finds the last details needed about Project Sarlacc. He secretly transmits the data, among with the other projects, to Palor's fleet through routed contacts. H473 notifies Rann in secrecy that the data was found and transferred. The two decide to stick with their illusive positions until the deciding fight occurs. Afterall, Rann has positioned himself close to Draco with H473 as Rann's top squad commander. H473 begins to use his status to upgrade his chasis and equipment. Rann makes sure his loyalty to Draco goes unquestioned and proves to Draco that he is more worthy than the other two apprentices. The apprentices still try to make power grabs against Rann, usually failing. But it becomes apparent that Draco still remains the strongest due to the corruption within him and the power boost from the entrapped holocrons (yes, three, as Draco has the Jedi holocron, the Sith holocron of Lord Rivan, and the Sith holocron of lord Revan).
Dek has nursed Adolf back to good health within hours. Adolf is introduced to the holocron's force spirit, Durvyn Turaliss and to the secret identity of 7A93, the Jedi Shard. With Adolf's blood, Durvyn's knowledge, and Dek's medic techniques, Adolf is cured of his anti-force curse. The group begins retraining Adolf in the ways of the force while hidden in the deep caverns on Nazrin. The first day after Adolf is cured, the four force users settle into a trance as per Durvyn's request. Seconds into the trance, a scream of pain occurs in the force. Dek immediately forms a force link with the others in the trance and projects everyone into farseeing. She focuses immediately on who the scream sounds like, Vespa. The group watches as Dek clarfies the images. Vespa has lost to Draco, fighting him all by herself. She has lost her right arm at the shoulder and Draco is offering her a postion at her side if she would just follow his dark side requests. She refuses and loses her left arm at the shoulder. She is in great pain and still refuses further requests. She manages to stand up. She turns to run and Draco throws his lightsaber, severing both legs. Vespa hits the floor. Her face looks terrible from the fall. Draco offers one last time, but Vespa screams, ""NEVER !"". Draco calls his lightsaber back and raises it, ""So be it daughter, you have no place in the world then."" As the lightsaber falls, Denia has parried the final strike. Draco looks slightly surprised at the arrival of Denia and Aram. Aram tries to strike Draco from behind, but Draco lunges sideways and separates himself from the pair. Both Jedi stand between Draco and Vespa. Then Denia commands Aram to take Vespa back to the ship. Aram looks at Denia, knowing that Denia cannot defeat Draco by herself. Denia has to repeat the command before Aram finally moves to a fading Vespa. As Aram collects the limbs of Vespa and takes her away, Dek's farseeing vision fades. She immediately restarts a new one centered on Denia this time. Adolf begins to fear the outlook of this confrontation. Amazingly Dek seems calm still. As the farseeing vision comes back to life, Denia has already began dancing lightsaber to lightsaber with Draco. Draco is obviously on the offense and Denia is barely able to keep up on defense. It is then that Rann appears, but only to Dek, at a distance while running as fast as he can. Then Draco sudden deflects a riposte by Denia and counters with a thrust straight into Denia's chest as her lightsaber flies off towards Rann's approach. Draco speaks, ""I offer you only once, submit and become my dark apprentice, or we finish this here Jedi."" Denia, barely able to breath, ""No. You will ..."" Draco ends her speach by uplifting the lightsaber while still in her. The farseeing vision begins to fade as Rann is heard walking in and speaking, ""Ah, Master Draco, I see you have finally ended that silly Jedi. May I offer my services to such a powerful Master, now that my quarry is dead?"" Adolf now has a confused, fearful, and angry look on his face.

0,,t1_cjq8ivb,1,1408039595,,t3_2didor,False,socialskills,False,,t5_2r275,"Shy and quiet are not the same thing.  So first, you need to figure out whether you are shy or quiet (introverted) or both.  

Shyness is the awkwardness or apprehension some people feel when approaching or being approached by other people. Unlike introverts, who feel energized by time alone, shy people often desperately want to connect with others, but don't know how or can't tolerate the anxiety that comes with human interaction. You can read more about this on [Psychology Today's!](http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/shyness) web site. 

Second, all the good advice of 'learn to accept yourself' aside, there is a bias for extroversion, especially in the workplace.  Extroversion is positively correlated with being promoted into leadership positions and if you don't share your ideas with other people you will not get credit for how brilliant you are. Let's face it, the world happens outside of your head and mostly out loud.  You might want to check out [Susan Cain's the Power of Introverts!](http://www.ted.com/talks/susan_cain_the_power_of_introverts) to learn more about introversion and being quiet. 

Since you have been trying and don't feel like you are getting results, you need some feedback.  I would find a few people who you trust and who you think will be honest with you and ask them what they think is the problem.  When you ask people for feedback that is likely to be negative, it is best to be very specific. For example say ""I've been trying to not be perceived as quiet, but it doesn't seem to be working.  Do you think that I am generally perceived as quiet?  What are some examples of times that you have seen me acting in a way that you think was too shy or quiet?  What are some specific ideas you have for helping me be more social or extroverted?""  When they give you the bad news, take notes and breath.  It is sometimes hard to deal with stuff you don't want to hear, but let's face it, it is the only way to know.  I always say, if I have spinach in my teeth it is not a kindness to let me go all day without telling me.  

Also, I always take notes when I am getting bad news.  It gives me something to do other than cry or get mad and when I have settled down there is usually some good stuff in there. If you go back through your notes later you can decide more rationally what is good advice and what is crap. 

Another source of the problem could be your body language.  Do you carry yourself in a way that does not look confident.  Do you look down a lot? Here is a good article on the [body language of power!](http://www.businessinsider.com/body-language-power-poses-2012-11?op=1) There are tons of books and resources on body language so check those out too. 

When you have collected your data and sort of know what the problem is then you can begin to create the plan to fix it.  Read books or take a classes in assertiveness or social skills.  Also, watch other people that you think are good at being social. Try to identify exactly what they are doing.  Pick one thing you like and try to mimic that. 

Find someone who can be your coach.  Don't look for a coach who has always been very social and extroverted, look for someone who has already done what you want to do.  You might have to ask around.  What people show is not always who they are.  I am an introvert who is perceived by the world as garrulous, outgoing and dynamic.  I have to fake it -- it is my job.     

Finally, there is only one way to get better and that is to practice.  Pick one thing, and only one thing, to practice at a time. (One thing is hugely important, but doesn't need to be explained in this post.)  Start easy, the advice about practicing with your family is great.  You can even practice a little in the mirror or with your pets first.  

Ask for more feedback as you practice.  You have to know whether you are doing it correctly or not.  One time in a dance class, I was feeling light as a feather, leaping and dancing and then I looked in the mirror and I looked like a sack of potatoes trying to dance.  We are not always good judges of what we are doing.  Keep practicing, building skills requires repetition, so hang in there it takes time. 

If the problem is shyness then it may need a little more work with therapy or other methods to boost self esteem.

You do realise anyone paying for micro-transactions was never forced to do so? Even if the game was effectively crippled on purpose to make the micro-transactions more attractive (looking at you, GTA V), that doesn't mean you *have* to pay anything.

Don't pay. If it absolutely ruins all the fun, then don't play. And don't buy the next game.

I personally don't understand why someone would pay for shortcuts in a single-player game. I kind of understood someone paying for currency in the AC MP, because you can catch up with higher level players (even if I still think it's never worth paying for it anyway), but in the case of Unity I really don't see the point. If you pay for a micro-transaction, say, like in AC4 to get a resource boost... why? it's a video game. Are you feeling like you're wasting time by having to collect these resources?

* Mana-less heroes - Heroes driven by other resources like Ammo, Charges or Rage, Energy. These resources can be quickly drained and recharged, like bristleback benefiting from spams and Troll benefiting from auto attacks. For Ammo - Dying creeps or heroes can leave behind packs which can be collected by simply walking over them. You dont have to make the new ones for this, you may modify the existing ones. Sniper, Drow, Windy etc. can be Ammo based. Troll, Bristleback or Juggernaut can be Rage based. Visage, OD or Pugna, Medusa, PA can be energy based, and we already know Xin and Earth Spirit are charges based. Balance out the stats a bit and remove mana from them.  

* Stricter Backdoor Protection - Couple of things come to mind. First, something like a perma glyph which gets disabled only if the tower can be attacked. Or secondly, return back whole damage to attacker in pure damage the moment backdoor is attempted.

* Fighting under tower - This I attempted on one of my maps in TFT World Editor. The tower projectile actually targets the location of enemy, rather than homing on to it. The projectile speed is balanced as such to leave only a small time window to dodge it. The damage, is buffed, for obvious reasons. This would change the laning phase drastically, making it more skill oriented. Of course this could break the current gameplay in many unknown ways.

* Creeps Upgrade - Barracks aren't just for show ! Click on them and you can upgrade the creeps for that lane by spending your gold. Melee creeps can get damage boost, armor boost or additional HP. Ranged creeps can get abilities to help them along the way like HP regen aura, chain lightning or split shot like attacks. Note that the creeps abilities will only be usable on creeps and will not affect Heroes + Player units. Each lane creeps must be separately upgraded though.

Smithing - Early on I find the transmute spell book in a dungeon near whiterun (should be in a wiki). Go mining for iron, turn all the iron into gold, make golden rings and necklaces with all the gems I've collected. Additionally make all the leather bracers and iron daggers (the daggers are for enchanting mostly). 

Enchanting - I practically always have soul trap as the enchant on my weapon to get the materials. Those in hand, you'll likely want fiery soul trap on the daggers (another dungeon run) and possibly fortify sneak on other items. You're going for value gain when you enchant. Those two are some of the best. Sell all the weapons. 
Alchemy - This one's always trickier for me. I generally just do alchemy in spurts, gaining 20 skill points at a time or so. Wearing alchemy boosted armor and drinking potions helps quite a bit. Again in alchemy we're looking for value so invisibility and fortify health potions are go-to's along with a few others. Once you get above a certain level, you can also simply make potions, sell all of them, buy more ingredients from the shop, and repeat in a positive loop. 

If you're doing large chunks of any of them at once, make sure you take advantage of buffs from standing stones, well rested bonuses, and also the gift of charity sometimes. Not sure if there's any more.   ",3,q25t,True,t3_2dh0tt,0,cjpq3cn,0,1435227221,

Once there, simply collecting your DE a couple times a day will keep your lab busy with DE troops 100% of the time. The time it takes vs the cost to upgrade is linear, meaning you can simply collect your way to maxed out DE troops. It's not quite as easy to do with elixir troops but similar. Any farmed DE can go into heroes, or sometimes I cycle in an elixir troop upgrade and blow my DE on a hero.

As for army comp I use a kitchen sink build (a little of everything) and revenge attacks. Revenge lets me scope out peoples bases to make sure I will get some decent loot without spending a boatload on hitting next (at 1k per). Also I started a second account as my ""main"" and feed high level troops from my TH10 over to my lower base, which is now TH7. This makes the game much more fun where I primarily play my new account and simply collect my resources and revenge attack on my rushed TH10. 

My second account is played using an app player for my PC so I can play both w/o a second device. This has made the game MUCH more fun to play on both accounts. 

I cannot stress enough to get those drills maxed out as your #1 priority. Farm the elixir if you have to, gem boost pumps with extra gems from boxes/trees if you have to. Keep them all on upgrade if you can, it's worth it in the long run!

The end state is, you need to boost your attacking force up so you can actually take on bases with good loot from the random nexting. For gold upgrades I just keep doing whatever is cheapest and try to keep my builders busy.",1,Rizla_Sepatown,True,t3_2dewxb,0,cjpq17y,0,1435227208,

Automation is a good that can only be realized as such if it is a collective enterprise. If not, dystopia awaits us. A famous quote by Rosa Luxemburg has never been more relevant:   
  
&gt;In this hour, socialism is the only salvation for humanity. The words of the Communist Manifesto flare like a fiery *""Mene Tekel""* above the crumbling bastions of capitalist society:

&gt;**Socialism or barbarism!**    
  
It really demonstrates the complete bankruptcy of our education in political economy and even philosophy that this whole video was done without one mention of capitalism, socialism, communism, or property. Honestly it's rage-inducing. I'm touched that some of those commenting in other subs felt it was relevant but it's not good enough. The crucial question will be ""Who owns the robots?"" This is, by definition, a question of capitalism vs communism/socialism. 

Automation should be desirable - it should free us from our chains to production so that we may live our lives to the fullest extent, to live our lives in a fulfilling way, and to be, as Jean-Paul Sartre once claimed of Che Guevara, the most complete human beings we can. The notion that life is something that must be ""earned"" is the most vulgar, narcissistic, agency-robbing pronouncement ever echoed by our fellow humans. Automation has freeing potential to ensure no one lives in sickness, starvation, and poverty. Furthermore it can bring forth an era of unprecedented technological progress, space exploration, and transhumanism. An era of freedom, beauty, love, and education *for their own sake*. The parallel is often drawn to [Star Trek](http://i.imgur.com/Mucnj.jpg) by many socialists and people love to shout about utopianism but this [isn't some utopia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism:_Utopian_and_Scientific). It's possible.    
  
But only if we progress beyond our capitalist stage. Only when we resolve the question of who owns the robots, that is, the question between communism vs capitalism. In capitalism, a necessarily class-stratified society, these robots will be owned and controlled by an oppressive class for the endless profit of themselves. The ""working"" (not anymore) class will be ever more disposable and society will be shaped with such a reality. When one ponders transhumanism things become more frightening. In a capitalist society that can produce for intelligence, create microchips and other nano-technological machines to boost human capability to almost super-human levels, who will be chiefly rewarded these abilities? The bourgeoisie. The rise of a bourgeois transhuman will axiomatically create an almost ""subhuman"" class of the unaided ""working"" class who, I fear, will essentially descend into a neo-lumpenproletariat class since the struggle will seem even more unwinnable and will instead prefer to content themselves with whatever the bourgeoisie kicks down to them (if they don't they will be punished even more harshly now that they aren't as needed).

From the Bureau of Labor Statistics Link

http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes333051.htm

Next to the Median Annual wage of $58,720, there is a footnote link that points to a description of what Median Annual Wage means:

http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes333051.htm#(2)

&gt;Annual wages have been calculated by multiplying the hourly mean wage by a ""**year-round, full-time"" hours figure of 2,080 hours**; for those occupations where there is not an hourly mean wage published, the annual wage has been directly calculated from the reported survey data.

These are base income figures, not counting overtime

The BLS also reports a mean HOURLY wage of $28.23.

So if a cop is working 60 hours a week, every week, he's making (28.23 x 40 + 42.35 x 20) x 52 = $102,762 per year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* In what phase of the product would you start the crowdsale and why? 

Fundamentally we have to keep in mind that the crowdsale is the mechanism with which you get the liquidity to a project until it becomes self sustaining. In the case of the DApps, the common mechanism for the self-sustenance is achieved when the market depth and the growth rate of the token adoption will be enough to support the sale of the tokens performed by the developers and service providers to cover expenses. 

Once the crowdsale is held it should be thought of as the race against the clock and you are in a prime period in which the application is most capable of tackling the challenges. That period is a boost period, like super mario having found the immortality star. You try to tackle as many challenges as you can as quickly as possible without falling in one of the gaps, until you loose that power and your ability to easily overcome challenges is reduced. 

There are two variables I'd highlight for the attention of a team contemplating the crowdsale, wondering at what stage of their development should they take this boost.

(Mario metaphor continues in parenthesis)
1)Will you be able to intelligently spend the raised capital to deliver a value creating network after the crowdsale?  (when you are immortal, do you know where you will find the most monsters to slay and build your points before it gets more difficult to slay them post-boost)

Think of this as ""have you identified the paths you will take to accomplish the most during your boost?"" Remember the money will run out, and you want to make sure that you've planned out what you are going to do with it to get as close as you can to self-sustaining value proposition.

2)Will you be able to demonstarate why this coin is valuable to the market during your crowdsale? (Imagine the star size is a function of how much you've convinced the immortality gods to increase the size of your star). Think of this as ""have you made it clear why to ""crowd"" should give you a bigger boost""?

3)The maturity of the crowdsale marketplace
As the marketplace for crowdsales mature, we can expect a greater fragmentation and it will likely be more difficult to raise as much capital as some of the early movers.

So your sub-questions can be answered with these variables in mind given the particulars of the DApp.

* Only white paper (like MSC)? An MVP?
If your implementation is fairly simple and straight forward then you don't need a big boost (liquidity from the crowdsale) and you don't need a whole bunch of planing (because the complexity due to the relationship between the parts is minimized). You will not need a lot of money because you are not trying to build a lot of features. So in that case the value proposition can be achieved with little capital and I'd say go ahead, collect a few BTC right away without having to convince the crowd to give you a big boost. If your implementation is complex, and you don't really know what the next steps will be then it may make sense to start developing so you have a better plan and greater convincing power.

* Would you advertise it in a ""blitz"" (coordinate many articles/ads for a specific day) or slowly over time?
Building interest is critical in getting participation in the crowdsale. And doing it overtime will get more people thinking about it, critiquing it and helping build it. If you need greater participation then you want to build as much a community as possible. Of course people are forgetful of particular dates so a blitz of 'reminders' would help.

* What would be the incentive structure? Every week the tokens-per-bitcoin goes down? Every X token bought the price per token goes up?

Increasing token value per time elapsed is a good incentive mechanism but may inflate the demand, because there are those who come in to the crowdsale early for the purposes of selling to latecomers. Increasing purchase price as purchases are made is a more conservative path, that will enable the price to reflect real demand for it.

* How much does having a known person in the community be part of the team helps?
Human decision making is socially influenced. In the market we value what others value. So if a thought leaders values a protocol then more people will. If more people value it then it will be easier for others to do the same.

* Do you think it's important to have the tokens give a monthly payout? (Is it possible today? Is it planned to be enabled?)
People, developers, service providers, miners/farmers in a network do appreciate certainty and locking in revenue. And yes we can use programmable wallets to distribute given amounts of tokens to particular addresses-this feature is possible today but has room to grow prior to adoption. When this capacity is combined with proof of work or resource it will be even more powerful to grow the networks.
 
* Other recommendations/considerations?
Keep thinking! We are the computers building the computers of tomorrow.

I'm creating an Andromeda team - [link here](https://www.padherder.com/user/Azrael/teams/#60706) - that uses (i) Andromeda, (ii) Karin, and (iii) Fenrir Knight Kamui. 

So my question is - what dungeon should I be farming?

The way I see it, there are two considerations here: (i) the likelihood of  spawns/drops and (ii) the importance of the skill-up.

As to the first point:

* Ice Mechdragon has 1.5x drop today, and probably 2x drop on Sunday.
* Ice Mechdragon may not have any 3x invade rate.
* Ice Mechdragon has the Blue Chaser invade - a Karin skill-up.
* Ice Mechdragon also has a rare spawn of Mystic Blue Knight - a Fenrir skill-up.

vs.

* Ocean Dragon Knight has the Blue Fairy invade - an Andromeda skill-up.
* Ocean Dragon Knight will have 2x drop rates this weekend and next.
* Ocean Dragon Knight will probably have a 3x invade rate next weekend.
* Ocean Dragon Knight only drops skill-ups for one monster.

As to the second point:

* Andromeda goes from 13 to 8 turns. My current team has 4 skill boosts, so she would go from 9 to 4 turns for her first skill and 8 for her second. That means she would probably go once in a five-turn dungeon and twice in a ten-turn dungeon (assuming I use her on turn five).
* Karin goes from 14 to 9 turns. My current team has 4 skill boosts, so she would go from 10 to 5 turns for her first skill and 9 for her second. That means she would probably go once in a five-turn dungeon and possibly twice in a ten-turn dungeon (assuming I use her on turn five). Karin would also like to have Fenrir Knight up simultaneously to guarantee 8 water orbs.
* Fenrir Knight goes from 9 to 5 turns. With 4 skill boosts, that means 1 turn for his first skill and 5 for his second. That's at least two uses per dungeon, depending on timing.

My thoughts:

Ice Mechdragon has 2 spawns instead of one - one of which is not an invade - and FKK would be great to skill up. On the other hand, Ocean Dragon Knight has 3x invade rates, which matters way more than 1.5x or 2x drop rate (except, I guess, when it comes to rare spawns). And Ocean Dragon Knight will be around for 2 weeks, which means I'll have more of a chance to actually amass some fairies. Considering I went 0/5 on my first batch of purple chasers, I have a feeling I'm going to need to collect quite a few invades to get some skill-ups.

I have an alt full of stacks of mats I will never user as it stands now, but I spent a lot of time collecting them and I don't want to just get 20g from a vendor for them.  How they handle those mats we have stacked on the reduction also worries me, what they SHOULD do is convert those mats to equivalent new mats but I suspect they won't.

Certain items, like pepper, honeycomb, salt, red wheat etc should continue to be harder to find and should continue to be the base for the better recipes. But I doubt they will do that either.  it will end up a ""new"" system which will just throw everything in turmoil when I think they should refine what they have now instead. 

Still on the plus side getting rid of 20 different types of grapes etc is probably a good thing, why they needed all that in the first place is beyond me.

The most interesting change though will be when they allow food and drink to stack.  Although with the raising of the soft caps I think those bonuses are pretty weak now for drinks (+8 I think it is on Purple drink, hardly a massive boost).

**Name**: Arashi no Me (Eye of the Storm)

**Command**: Sora o Toriorose (Bring the sky crashing down)

**Description**: Before release, a regular wakizashi that's a couple of inches shorter than a katana, but the handle is 20-30% thicker than usual. On release, a thin strip from the middle of the blade dissipates and the two remaining halves bend further apart from each other, creating a tuning fork appearance. Should the need arise, the handle splits exactly in half to allow each blade to be wielded separately.

**Shikai Ability**: Redirection of spirit energy in to electrical current and circuiting it around the user's body. Pointing the blade directly at incoming energy attacks breaks them down, transforms them in to electrical current and passes them through the body, increasing the user's speed and reflexes while doing so, meaning that the more the opponent throws, the faster the user becomes. A clever way to take advantage of this ability is to cast Kido against your own blade, which forces the expended reiatsu to be collected around the user's body for the speed boost (though somebody would catch on to this pretty quick and prevent the trick being done often). Someone with overwhelmingly strong energy attacks would be able to overload the absorption process (can't break down + absorb fast enough to not take damage). The most important aspect is that all spiritual bodies release reiatsu passively unless they repress it on purpose. This means that, if the opponent is allowing their reiatsu to leak as they fight, the zanpakuto can feed on it, increasing the user's speed even if the opponent isn't firing energy attacks directly.

**Bankai**: **Kaikenran** (All-Seeing Tempest). 2 fingers are inserted in to the tuning fork's gap and flicked across the blades' length, coating it in blood. Lightning emitted from the zanpakuto becomes tainted a deep shade of red after the release is complete. Shihakushō ends up looking a bit like [this](http://img1.lln.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/d2ecc186ca89de80678fbdd739d14d541274521050_full.jpg) but with blood streak patterns like an inverted version of [this](http://images.mmosite.com/cabal/guides/volunteer/arshesnei/12088_cb16.jpg) (with black, not white). The weapon itself extends to the length of a longsword (and can still be split apart for two thinner blades). The gap in the middle is now closed at the end, so there is a definitive tip when the blades are together. The remaining gap becomes opaque, thick with red electricity.

**Bankai Ability**: The weapon is now able to transform the reiatsu being emitted by the user's reiryoku directly in to the current that surrounds the user, massively increasing its potency. There is no longer a defined entry or exit point - reiatsu-based abilities will be converted no matter where they hit the user instead of just through the blades. Subsequently, the user can now send converted reiatsu outwards in its electrical form in any way they choose, as well as convert reiatsu hanging in the air and releasing it against an enemy immediately without going through the user directly. This effect extends as far as the user's reiatsu reaches. The most popular way to use it offensively for a quick kill is to point the blade at an enemy and beam out invisible reiatsu from the tip in the same way that clouds in the sky fire ""feeder"" bolts to create a circuit with the ground to discharge lightning. When that reiatsu connects, a circuit will be formed and the user immediately discharges a ton of electricity through the opponent's body, shredding them from the inside in an instant.",2,Auesis,True,t3_2dc7jq,0,cjoldk1,0,1435207846,

Or just buy the finished potion from broker, that works too. Just make sure it's usable by your level, higher tier potions are only for higher level players.


You can go to Velika and look at what recipes are available from the alchemy recipes NPC, at first you won't be able to make anything good but as you craft stuff, you level alchemy up and upgrades become available. [Location of crafting NPCs shown in this map.](http://tera-mysteries.wbs.cz/velikamap.jpg) Potions have a relatively long cooldown so they are not the most reliable thing, they are more for emergency situations, even when you are in a party/raid with healers.


You can also buy bandages from the specialty merchant in all towns, except the three major ones (Velika, Allemantheia and Kaiator do not have specialty merchants). Those are only usable outside of combat, however, but you can still kite a BAM for long enough to get out of combat and use them if necessary.


My advice is the same as Enignite's, though. If you don't really want to skip quests, that's fine, just make sure to use the avatar weapons (the ones you collect relic pieces for) since those offer a hugely boosted crit rate against enemies of similar level to the weapon's requirement. You can combine those weapons with crystals that increase crit damage and you are set for really easy BAM fights. The crystals you want are called **Acrimonious, Fine Focused, Fine Savage and a choice between Fine Carving/Fine Forceful**. Since avatar weapons have boosted crit rate against similar level, you probably want Fine Forceful. Now what you have to understand is that you have to attack from the back of the BAM to achieve the boosted damage with these crystals, and these are pretty much the standard ones used by DPS classes who know what they are doing in endgame PvE. It doesn't matter what class you are when levelling, these crystals combined with avatar weapons, though of course usable with normal weapons as well, make BAM fights much faster and easier even if you were a healer. You can even adapt this for normal mob grinding/questing if you wanted, just replace the Acrimonious with a Backbiting, but this shouldn't really be necessary at all and you can stick to Hunter crystals if you prefer... It's usually not as easy to stick to the back of normal mobs, but doable with stuns, or when they are busy attacking the air after you dodge, etc. Easier for some classes than others.


In parties with a tank, attacking from the back is much easier since you won't have to kite around or dodge through the BAM to reposition yourself as often, and a lot of bosses don't usually attack behind them (but it's still the case for some, through the use of AoE or other quirks).


Huge wall of text aside... just practice a lot and identify the tells of attacks so you know what's coming. Fighting BAMs while leveling is good since a lot of boss monsters in endgame and while leveling are reskins and recolors of what you are encountering now. Some will have added attacks and increased attack speed, but the core of it will be the same. You'll be more prepared by the time you reach level 60.",4,Bunlapin,True,t3_2dcx8f,0,cjobml7,0,1435203099,

You can actually platinum it on one playthrough, if you want to put the effort in. I did it in two, but I did the bulk of the grinding work in my first playthrough for GRADE.

Some of the more grindy trophies in the game are the Battle Challenge trophies. There are Easy ones and Hard ones, and you get a trophy each for doing a certain number of them, plus a trophy once you've finished all of them. These are the only missable ones in the game, iirc. For example, one of them is for beating 18 Giganto monsters within 2 minutes, so if you fight too many of them early on without switching to Easy or making sure you're at a high enough level, the fights could take too long and you'll miss out because you'll simply run out of Giganto monsters. So definitely scroll through all of the challenges at the beginning of the game and take note of what's there so you can keep them in mind while you play.

The ""bad ending"" is kind of difficult to get. You can certainly do it in your first playthrough but there's a hard final boss fight with it that you fight alone for, so I left it until my second playthrough when I could have GRADE shop exp boosts to prepare. (It's also ""missable"" if you don't choose the right options for it, so maybe keep a save at Chapter 15 if you want to be able to go back for it to try it out, if you miss it.)

I guess otherwise... if you did platinum on Xillia, you kind of know what to expect in Xillia 2. All those personal/support skills you had to grind in the first game, you get to do all over again in 2, except with more characters. So if you can do some of that while you're playing instead of leaving it all to the end like I did, it'll go a little easier.

My general suggestions:

1. Send out the cats to scavenge for items as often as you can, and pay attention to the daily bonus. (ie, sometimes you get bonuses in Rieze Maxia, sometimes in Elympios, etc.) Collect cats whenever you hit a new area. (There's usually one or two per map, like Aifread's treasures in X1.) The items they pick up are used a lot in quests and you can get decent weapons and attachments from the rare finds.

2. The easiest way to raise affection with everyone AND to pay off your debt, is just to gamble, which you unlock in a subquest. I wouldn't bother trying too hard for any of this, though, until the end of the game. Once you beat the final boss and open up the EX Dungeon, it becomes easy to get Dice items which let you cheat at poker and if you do it right, you can rake in tons of chips in one go. You can exchange the chips for either friendship potions or a certain item that sells for like 20k gald, so that's the best way I found to do either of these things.

3. Don't spend too much time doing every subquest until you get the World Map that lets you jump between areas, which I don't think comes along until chapter 4 or 5. It's really tempting to do eeeverything on the quest board whenever you can, but it's too tedious to be worth it until you can quick travel back to turn them in. :( Just do the bare minimum to collect the gald you need to move on until you have it.",3,Cherrim,True,t3_2dbuu2,0,cjo9u24,0,1435202086,
0,,t1_cjo5q3i,2,1407860407,,t3_2d8u98,False,tropico,False,,t5_2sms0,"My priority for when picking which buildings.

1. Economy
2. Education
3. Happiness
4. Housing



I've found when starting out the most important building is the 
Immigration Office.  Solving the worker shortage asap will give you good income and help you with so many other problems down the line.  Unemployment is the easiest way to get more protesters and unhappy people.  A Tropican who works is taking the first step toward happiness.  

Once you've got enough production from spamming a few good island resource farms/ranches focus on education.  It starts costing lots of money to import those foreigners after the first few.  High School should be up and running before the first election.  

Church wants to be one of your first buildings outside of education and after you've got some good income coming in from industry.  If you're in trouble for the first election you might need to plop this down during the run up to it.  But I usually like to have a factory going first.

Get a market soonish.  Usually right around factory time.  You want about 1:1 ratio of high school workers in factory verses other stuff. 

Get by with as few entertainment buildings as possible until you get electricity and can build the luxury restaurant.  

You've got to build a clinic pretty early.  It's not horrible to make this one of your first buildings.  It will provide some nice work for a few college educated folks if you've got them on the island and they stick around long enough to wait for the building to construct.  College educated Tropicans do not like working a high school job or lower and leave asap.  

If the shacks start getting out of control plop down a tenement or two.  You don't want to be building anything on shacks because when you kill their home it usually delays when they'll show up for work again because of the whole not having a house thing.  

The military is a pay as you go kind of thing.  Keep them small until you can afford all of those sunken costs.  You can buy some time with raising pay but you'll most likely need an armory sooner rather than later.  Too early and it'll compete with jobs at your clinic.  Too late and you'll likely be up against a four person coup d'état.  And with only a high school education you could lose easily with three supporters.  

Keep buildings close.  I know it looks like you've got this whole huge island but in reality you've only got how far the fat ass teamsters will walk to collect and deliver stuff.  And don't forget about planning for future roads.  They are expensive and take a while to build but they are worth it just for the increased teamster speed. 

Basically everywhere you put down a construction/teamsters office should be a good spot for making a mini city.  It won't need all the bells and whistles but combining those two with some housing, church, market, clinic, restaurant will pretty much keep them happy and going to work often without having to walk across the entire island to pick up whatever they need.  

I only ever build tenements.  If you're providing enough good stuff elsewhere you can take a hit here and not worry too much.  Also if the dock is far away from the housing you can give those guys a raise and then jack up the rent at a close by housing which should keep them closer to work and working more often keeping the supply of goods at the dock moving smoothly.

My favorite way to play the game was tobacco, cigars, machine cigars.  When each level of income goes up you can provide more services also in that tier.  Doing Booze Barron will help you get a good build order because the extra money will mean you can make some different choices.  Playing for lumber, logs, furniture will help you understand the logistics a little better.  Also take some time and just watch some of the workers at different jobs.  This can be a lot of fun and you'll pick up clues about all kinds of different things.  

Early no birth control can do wonders for population later in game.  Also if you really want to boost the birth rate early try hiring some high school teachers and then fire them when they arrive and repeat.  It usually takes a few years before they start having kids, sometimes they won't even marry.  Then you've got to wait another 13 years before they can start getting into the work force but this can help boost the population.     ",2,awinsalot,True,t3_2d8u98,0,cjo5q3i,0,1435200059,
0,,t1_cjo3t0t,2,1407856704,,t3_2dbtxu,False,Terraria,False,CowboyHat,t5_2sg5b,"First off: weapons. The Dao of Pow, Adamantite Glaive or Titanium Trident are very useful since they can hit several parts in one swing. Swords aren't the best outside of hitting the Probes, but if you've been (un)fortunate enough to encounter a Pirate Invasion, then the Cutlass that one of them has a chance to drop can vastly increase your chances of victory. Otherwise, use a Phasesaber or Beam Sword for damage (the former autoswings, whilst the latter can swing pretty damn quick and has the laser attack as an added bonus). If you can find it, use an Ice Sickle - found from Hardmode enemies in the Underground Ice Biome, it fires projectiles that still count as melee damage, can hit a few times before dissipating, and have no limit on the projectiles you can have on-screen at once. It packs a punch to boot!

Next: armour. Adamantite or Titanium is the way to go here, although if you can get access to Orichalcum and feel safe dodging, use that - sometimes a petal can ping right along The Destroyer and cause tons of damage (roughly 30 damage per hit means each hit adds up). Adamantite just buffs your stats, whilst Titanium will give you the Shadow Dodge every twenty seconds, granting you a free shot of invulnerability alongside an extended mercy invulnerability (2 seconds worth, iirc). And make sure to get the Melee-centred helmets - they have the best defence, and every point counts!

Accessories is the next part. For survival, have every single one reforged to Warding. 20 Defence total means you're getting another ten damage removed from each hit. Then for actual accessories, you can use a **Cross Necklace** or **Star Veil** (heck, maybe both if you want to stack them!) which both increase your mercy invulnerability time (you flash longer when you get hit, basically). Then there's the **Charm of Myths**, which increases your natural health regeneration and lowers potion sickness to 45 seconds from 60. An **Obsidian** or **Ankh Shield** blocks knockback and adds 2/4 points to your Defence stat, which is always a plus. The Obsidian Shield is more readily available, whilst the Ankh Shield blocks most debuffs. Wings aren't entirely necessary, but they let you beat a hasty retreat if things get a bit worrying, HP-wise.

For buffs, there's a bunch you can take. Regeneration increases your health regen, Ironskin gives you +8 Defence, Well Fed boosts your stats lightly so it's useful to have, Featherfall lets you hang in the air for longer, meaning you only need to dodge the lasers. Then there's either the Rage or Wrath potions that'll bolster your crit-chance or damage dealt by 10% each. The Hunter buff can let you spot The Destroyer in the land and get a quick dodge before it bursts from the ground. An Endurance potion can decrease damage taken by 10% (which, once again, adds up). A Lifeforce potion can increase your maximum health by 20%, which can boost a 400HP bar to 480HP, or a 500HP bar to 600HP. Finally, there are Heartreach potions that lets you grab hearts from further away. This is a godsend because you won't have to run around collecting hearts all the time (which drops rather frequently from the Probes).

(you can also have a Heart Lantern and Campfire or two sitting about where you're fighting to increase your health regen even *more*)

Finally, there's the arena. You can control the landscape, so don't let The Destroyer have an edge over you - it digs through that stuff whilst you have to scale the jagged landscape. Flatten out a screen or two's worth of land so that you have a decent area to run across, and make sure that enemies can't wander in and interrupt the fight, especially if you're fighting in the Hallow - those Gastropod lasers sting a lot worse than The Destroyer's or its probes' lasers, and they look deceptively similar, so you could end up dying because of errant spawns.

For *fighting* The Destroyer, you can't facetank it as others did when 1.2 came out. Its bodywork is super tough and can easily wreck your HP bar. A high defence can mitigate the damage, but make sure to back away every so often if your health dips below a hundred. Swing the Dao of Pow along The Destroyer's body, stab it with your spears, leave Ice Sickles where it'll charge towards, swing wildly with your Phasesaber or Beam Sword, basically hit it as much as possible. Its 80,000HP starts to fall rapidly considering you hit several body parts at a time. If things get rough, kill some of the probes for quick health - they're not as generous as they used to be, but they do drop hearts from time to time. Make sure to have at least ten Greater Health Potions, because you're likely to use them a lot in the fight. Use one when your health dips low. If you're still waiting on the cooldown to go away, fly above The Destroyer so that only its Probes and lasers will be a threat. They're generally easier to dodge until your sickness goes away, and once you've chugged another potion you can dive back into the fray.

Reload cancelling is just another part of what could be considered COD's skill ceiling, which is usually uncorrelated with player level if you don't incorporate new players to the franchise.

They've added a lot of depth with the movement system and the boosting (combining the titan boosts with double jump) although taking away the potential of learning wall run patterns should allow for interesting reactions to the arcade style of gameplay in the franchise.

The gamemode they mentioned in the Rev3 impression was also interesting, it was basically a form of basketball where you try to get balls collected from a central area to a goal - while holding a ball you can't attack anyone but you can pass it between people before getting to the objective.

This game could have a lot of longevity but with COD being an annual franchise I'm quite sad to say that it will probably lack the time and hype needed to grow a dedicated competitive community.

This is my second play through, my first being a normal/classic run and now I'm going for hard/classic. My Male Avatar is +Magic/-Luck.

Prologue:

I paired AvatarxChrom and LissaxFrederick from the off (I used these pairs in Chapters 1 and 2 aswell), the former to get those tasty veteran boosts and the latter to give Lissa +2 Def and +1 Move, while preventing Frederick Emblem from being a thing. Lots of healing happened. No problems.

Conclusion:

Avatar: Level 3
Chrom: Level 3
Lissa: Level 3
Frederick: Level 1

Chapter 1: 

Turn 1 my paired units moved downwards, with Lissa being kept out of harms way. Sully and Virion made their grand entrance right in the middle of the other Shepherds, and I paired them up. AvatarxChrom moved to a fort and killed an enemy, then were besieged on the suicide squads's turn. There were but four survivors of the risen suicide pact, one of which faced the unSULLYd, two of which followed their kin into the Avatars embrace, just leaving the Chief to rush in an attempt to join his comrades. Falchion wept that day.

Conclusion:

Avatar: Level 5
Chrom: Level 5
Lissa: Level 3
Frederick: Level 1
Sully: Level 2
Virion: Level 2

Chapter 2 OR A tale of two lost lovers OR How not to guard a bridge

Umm... I don't really remember how this one went. Sorry. There was healing and enemies abandoning their bridge so they could be swarmed, but that's about it. Use those forts people!

Conclusion:

Chrom: Level 6
Lissa: Level 4
Frederick: Level 1
Sully: Level 2
Virion: Level 2
Vaike: Level 3
Stahl: Level 2
Miriel: Level 1

Chapter 3:

Frederick knows the importance of Diplomacy. He knows therefore that Prince Chrom, Emmeryn's heir can't just marry anyone. Oh no! So when a girl literally head over heels for Chrom turns up Frederick knows he must do something. Chrom clearly likes Sumia with her Pegasus, literally flying into the path of projectiles, the most perilous situation for a flying unit, to save him. Frederick knows therefore that it's only a matter of time. He knows the Canon. He therefore does what he must for the good of the realm: he pairs up with Sumia. And so the first planned marriage is born!

I paired Lissa with Vaike for +2 Def, moved CxA westwards to collect Kellam, and sent SxF to form a wall just out of the archers range. After defeating those enemies I went east to gather that tasty EXP and to have a spare Door Key for a later chapter, which should come in handy. AxC defeated the knight, and much Healing took place as I moved my units up into position. I was careless in moving units just within range and SxF was attacked by two units including an archer but fortunately one missed. Also, Vaike hit something and gained a level (no one to heal at this point). AxC finished off Raimi no problem.

I don't think you can shoot anyone anywhere without earning a bounty. 

The best thing to do is to buy a Kill-Warant scanner for your Viper. Scan every ship you meet, regardless of what system you are in (there is no need to scan security force ships, at least as far as I know). 

Even if you start attacking a ship that is already wanted, scanning him will ensure you get a bounty voucher out of it. Killing it outright might not bring you any cash, and what's worse that if you start shooting before scanning (even if you shoot at a pirate), security ships will start attacking you anyways if they are close.

I don't think that all of these aspects will stay as they are. At the moment, engaging in combat reaps almost no profit. If you are in a bigger ship, you will ALWAYS lose money when going after ships, never gain. For example, a load of missiles on a type-9 might cost above 35k. You will never make 35k via collecting bounties with 1 full load-out of missiles, so you will be at a huge loss.

Escaping fines is the best thing to do if you want to stay ahead. Go to Nav Beacons if you are looking for trouble, and scan every ship you meet. Almost all Cobras tend to have some bounty on them, and many of the trader ships as well. Anacondas will net you 3k+ in bounties, sometimes.

If a security vessel attacks you - better run and jump out, then jump back in. Killing him will result in a hefty fine of 1-2k credits, sets you back a lot if you rely on bounty vouchers. 

Finally, don't worry about fines too much. Even if you are wanted in a system, if you request docking and land before they scan you - you will be safe, always. I've only ben killed once by a station, and only because I was carrying stolen cargo. I could have easily escaped, but missed my opportunity and died. So just make sure to be fast when you enter. If you get a scan - boost forward as best as you can, escaping scan range. Even the station starts attacking you - if you manage to dock you will be fine and you'll be able to pay your fines and leave untouched.

edit: Some tips on the K-warrant scanner: Make sure that you can access it easily. I use 1 weapon group, having 4 cannons as primary and the scanner as secondary. Fly to the ship and try your best to keep a distance between 900-300 meters. You need to aim and shoot with the scanner, as you would with any weapon. If you lose target - DO NOT release the shoot button, just get the target back in your sight as soon as you can. After the scan finishes you will hear a strange tingling sound, and then you can check the lower left screen for the target info. If it still says 'clean' - leave the ship and find somebody else. If it says 'wanted' attack him and melt him down at will. This applies for enemy interdictions. ",2,b_fnk,True,t3_2d84lu,0,cjn0b06,0,1435180187,
0,,t1_cjmwfbw,5,1407740164,,t3_2d7nl8,1407741430,WildStar,False,,t5_2sqwc,"This is gonna be a bit disjointed but here's some thoughts:

Pros:

-Unique, refreshing telegraph based combat. 

-Slick movement system with momentum and ramping off of stuff for higher jumps. 

-Housing with tons of room for creativity.

-No flying mounts - this is a big plus for me.

-Challenging but fair dungeons.

-Decent character customization and dye system.  

-Levelling zones look amazing, graphics are great, sometimes jaw dropping.

Cons: 

-Poor performance on machines that should do well.  I am one of the lucky few that got Wildstar to work really well right out of the box.  But lots of people playing the other latest and greatest games are finding it impossible with their setup to get acceptable performance on Wildstar.  This is slowly improving.

-Very much a WoW formula game as far as levelling goes, i.e. collect 30 boar butts so you can get a lead on a guy who needs you to collect 30 bear butts.

-Bugs (I say with dwindling confidence all the major ones will get sorted soon but there are some bad ones that are STILL around - for example, crafted gear sold on the AH can randomly lose its stats, and said stats may or may not return on a complete relog or a server restart, this has been around for 3+ months, or how about guild masters losing hours and hours of dungeon attunement progress and literally being unable to restart).  Bugs like these can linger for a long time, and new ones appear EVERY PATCH this is not an exaggeration, their testing process is questionable.  There have been a few cases where certain classes were rendered 'unplayable' (rotations got screwed but unplayable? maybe no) for several days, until a hotfix arrived, due to bugs introduced in a patch.  Happened to stalkers, spellslingers and maybe more.

-Evidence of awful customer service.

-Lack of character recustomization (i.e. hair color/style, accessories etc).  

-You CANNOT expect to do well in dungeons with the LFG tool, the content is just too demanding for the average player.  Grouping is more old school in that you have to socialize and form groups by hand - This reallllly turns off a lot of casuals and creates some toxic LFG tool groups with high expectations from half the players and cluelessness from the other.

-Bad PVP experiences, rigged arena ratings, exploits galore.  Exploits that have been around, go unpunished, etc...for so long they are 'required' to be used to stay competitive.

***Warrior Rant based on PERSONAL OPINION and a lot of warrior PVE experience: Warriors blow ass.  I played one to 50, gave it an honest fair chance, lots of hours @50.  But the threat issues, boring rotation, mashing of rampage - a move that requires 4 button presses yet takes only 1 spot on your bar, what the heck man...these and other issues drove me away.  The fact that there is a ~1yd deadzone in front of their feet on the telegraphs but ranged classes don't have that nonsense? cmon man. If anything All war moves should have a bit of the telegraph going behind them.  Maybe warrior will get some Quality of Life improvements down the line but for now, eff that noise.  Engineer is way, way better.  The huge range boost alone was enough to convince me to never touch war again, before I even dinged 20.  DPS Rotation is fun - self buffs for massive crits, and abilities that require crits to cast.  Their 'rampage'? a 1 button press 3 second channel.  That's right, you can do decent damage by channeling a spell for 3 seconds with 1 button press.  Want to cast your resource requiring spell with warrior?  Better pump up that ferocity, and better keep it up so you are doing max damage.  It's dropping really fast so keep mashing 1! But on engineer?  Roll twice, yes, dash, to generate your resource that does stick around when you aren't mashing 1, cast your resource generating buff, and start mowing them down.  I'm sorry warriors but holy crap, you really need some work because you are just not fun.  As far as PVP goes, it's very frustrating with the short range.  Being unable to cast half of your abilities because you can't land a ferocity generating spell is very frustrating, but maybe i'm just bad at pvp lol.

Final thoughts - I think it's worth picking up Wildstar.  Be prepared to be kicked in the nuts by a major bug down the line though, because sooner or later it will happen to you.  Brush it off and keep on trucking tho, you'll be fine.  Do not invest too much effort into PVP or PVE until some major stuff gets fixed.  I am starting to get worried about some bugs that should have been squashed a long time ago, and how often new ones appear, but it's still early in the game, and what we have so far is well worth the price of admission.  The road to 50 is quite enjoyable, with some awe inspiring moments.  There is plenty to do at 50 as well, just keep an eye out for the stuff that is not bugged, try to stick to activities where you cannot lose progress.  I'm a costume whore from the days of City of Heroes and this game does pretty well to scratch that itch, and I had a ton of fun making a jump puzzle that requires a mount in my housing.  Focus on the good and this game can really shine! But be prepared to run into something ugly.

***** SANFRECCE HIROSHIMA VS. SAGAN TOSU 1 FT 2.35****

It's one of those bet that could just go either way, you see, Sagan Tosu is Revelation of the season. A Team without South American, African or European player, and doesn't even have the best local players, are currently top of the league thanks to their efficient way of play. Moreover, Sagan Tosu is the best team playing Away. They have played 9 away games and won 7. this is fantastic record which just hard to replicate by any team. Coupled this fact with how unimpressive Hiroshima Home Record are (4-2-3), you'll have to ask for my sanity of why i pick Hiroshima. The thing is, Sagan Tosu have just fired their manager over problems with the board. It's disturbing how an enthusiastic manager could be just fired like that. I'm sure this is massive factor that have to be considered. They are undoubtedly would hurt by this event. Sagan Tosu performances this far are very much hugely contributed by their past manager, it will be hard to see them healed so quickly after this sudden recent development. Things are sorrow for the home team as well, Hiroshima are just come back from a heavy 5-1 loss by Kashima Antlers, hopefully this would benefit them for an extra motivation, they are sure are eager to come back up and makes up their season. 

Alternatively, pick UNDER 2.5 Goals at 1.80 odds, Sagan Tosu are usually playing very defensive Away.

***** ESBJERG FB VS. SILKEBORG IF  1 FT 1.80****

The Odds on this one is surprisingly generous. Esbjerg are decent team that sit on 5th last season. Silkeborg are promotion team that seems likely will come back to 1st division next term because their uninspiring performances and even failed to score goal so far. The odds are understandably high for Esbjerg because they are on stalled period right now, zero win in 4 games including the 2-legged Europa League clash with Ruch Chorzow which sees them out of that competition and sit second from the bottom of Superliga Table. However their last league match against much fancied  FC Nordsjælland sparks some hope to salvage this season, they're dominated that game and just seems so unfortunate to eventually lose. I'm really convinced about this bet because it's unlikely Silkeborg can caused some suprises with the way they play right now. Esbjerg can fix their position in the league because it's their sole priority now, they can start getting good at this game 

***** GREUTHER FÜRTH VS. NÜRNBERG  1 FT 2.28****

Greuther Fürth deserves to be in Bundesliga right now, they're just slightly missing out in Play-off against Hamburg because of away goal rule. Nurnberg as relegated team from last season Bundesliga also have credentials to be back to top divison as fast as possible. Nurnberg first team content is one of the stronger in Bundesliga 2 right now, while Greuther Fürth still rely on their strong collective play. This is Greuther Fürth first home game of the season and that would be a massive boost for them to win this game. Their Home performances are always reliable and one of the best last season. Nurnberg only won 1-0 against inferior Erzgebirge Aue last week, their performances are far from peaked and their defence breached many times. It's Undoubtedly would be a very close game but i Believe Greuther Fürth can exploit their home advantages and come out victorious.

Alternatively, pick OVER 2.5 Goals at 1.98 odds, Both Teams Defence are unreliable to kept clean sheet.

Every single competition I've ever done in many parts of the world frowns upon sandbagging. Having a black belt in Judo and competing at the white belt division is big time sandbagging and a bitch move. 

I earned my blue belt with less than a year of training after smashing white belt divisions and beginner brackets in consecutive tournaments in both coasts. My first competition as a blue belt was at NAGA, in the gi I competed at blue belt, without the gi they made me register for the intermediate (2-5 years) bracket. I was kind of annoyed since their own charts say the beginners bracket is from 6 months to 2 years; in which I thought I should be competing at, I complained to my coach and he told me **""We came here to test ourselves, not to collect medals!""** I took first place in the gi and got destroyed on my second NOGI match (something like 13-4) by some dude who went on to win the bracket, no shame in losing there. Literally 2 weeks later I ran into the same dude at the Big Apple Open competing with a 2 stripe purple belt on. 

With that said, if you just want to tool white belts and smash noobs for an ego boost and to get worthless medals then by all means be a bitch and sandbag, don't even register for the beginners bracket, you can do the Novice bracket and get some highlight reel footage. Shit,  I""m not even ranked in judo, but I bet having a judo black belt and rolling with real bjj white belts must feel like partaking in the kids class. You should have zero problems  taking down and securing kesa gatame on your opponents.

Or

You can register as far up as they'll let you (with a judo bb, purple belt division should be open), and you can truly challenge yourself and see how badass you really are when you are up against people who can actually keep up with you.",3,Grapphax,True,t3_2d6ke3,0,cjmva5r,0,1435177754,

I regret to say that a growing number of Australians are now traveling to Iraq and Syria and other conflict zones.

Their aim is do harm and some hope to bring back deadly skills to Australia.

The threat to Australia and to Australians from these extremists is real and growing.

So this week, the Government announced a series of measures that will strengthen our national security.

The Government will be providing a further $630 million over four years to boost the counter terrorism capacity of our security and intelligence organisations, including the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, and the Australian Secret Intelligence Service.

We will prosecute those who engage in terrorism tourism. This is a serious offence – and if you do it, it will mean jail.

The Government is strengthening our ability to monitor, arrest, and prosecute people who have been involved with terrorist groups abroad.  As well, we want to prevent would-be terrorists from departing Australia.

As part of these plans, we want telecommunications companies to keep their data. We don’t want to collect new data – but to ensure the limited data already collected can be accessed by authorities to build a case against those who have or are planning to commit crimes.

And we are determined to stop the flow of money that supports these extremists in their activities.

These are measures to make 23 million Australians safer.

We will keep our promise to provide you with a safe and secure Australia – as safe and secure as government can possibly make it.*

Things are going to be tough for you because loot against lower THs is far less prosperous and even clicking 'next' is going to eat up your gold.

I've always found the best way to spend gems is actually on 2H barracks speed boosts. It costs 10 gems for each barracks and really helps as you can basically attack non-stop until you take a break/get bored/etc. If I were you, I'd just use a quick training strategy (barching) and find the best league for decent loot you can find (I'm not a TH10 so I wouldn't be sure of this). 

Ultimately, you'll need to spend a LOT of time collecting gold because you're fairly far back on defences, but obviously even more far back on walls. If you're committed to spending a few hours a day hopefully the barracks boosts can help you catch up a bit quicker.

Good luck.

* Deconstruct anything with the ""Intricate"" trait on it. These boost your tradeskills up by a pretty big chunk, compared to most other items.

If you *really* want to get into crafting:

* Deconstruct everything else - blues, greens, purples, all of it. You'll get raw materials, boosters, and other items that you can either use to make your own gear, or sell to other people.
* Read any Racial Motif books you find, if you don't already know that style. The blue ones aren't selling for very much anymore, but if you want to make gear for your friends (or for clients!), you'll have to be able to match their aesthetic tastes.

If you really want to make money:

* Collect lots of Raw materials (iron ore, raw jute, leather scraps), but don't refine them. Instead, sell full stacks of those (100x) to other players.

What I didn't realize immediately, though (it actually took me buying a few of the video games to realize) is that the cards don't seem to feel like they all exist together. There's no sense of theme. Yeah, Yugi love his dark cards, Joey loves his gambling cards, Kaiba loves his dragons, but the initial sets cards just felt like several hundreds of ideas a few people had while coming up with the game.

A new set or series came out and I didn't want to buy cards but I wanted to keep playing with friends so I just passed on it. But my friends all bought the newest cards. We would play games and they would win every time. Not because I was bad at the game or they were better, but I realized that the older cards didn't stand a chance against the newer cards. I realized it was a hobby that I would HAVE TO continue to sink money into if I wanted to win, even playing casually against my friends.

(What's weird is that they kind of display this in the show: with each new season, Joey starts off losing because he doesn't have up-to-date cards, and Yugi has new cards in his deck that he hasn't had the opportunity to try out but wins nearly every game because of a new card he has that no one knows he has.)

While standard Magic is no different on the money-sinking front, there's more than that format to play. There's Commander, which is most fun when you take your spare cards and build a deck. There's drafting and Cube, which costs a set amount of money and anybody can come out on top opposed to the person who put the most money into their deck. There's Planechase, which can throw even the most tournament-ready deck for a loop. There's Archenemy, which lets three people team up against one person so even if that one person's deck is ridiculously powerful the team can still work together to bring him or her down. And these are just the major ones recognized by Wizards; there's entire communities dedicated to creating new and fun ways to play.

And what's more, I don't have to buy new cards with every rotating block if I want to win. Cards within a block all work together with so much synergy that I still stand a chance against a friend who has more recent cards (barring use of Legacy decks). All the same card types and archetypes return so I don't have to worry about a new powerful enchantment my opponent casts in a casual game because every set has at least one card that says ""Destroy target enchantment."" If I like token-making decks I'm not restricted to one or two cards that make tokens because there's always enough cards that say ""Put this many X/X certain color tokens onto the battlefield"" for me to make several styles of token-making decks. In Yugi-Oh, if my opponent plays the Seal of Orichalcos and I already played my ""Destroy a Spell card"", I'm probably screwed because I don't have one of three Mystical Space Typhoons to deal with it.

I played against a friend using only cards from the original Ravnica block against his Zendikar block deck and won (one turn away from losing every time but won nonetheless). I then took an Innistrad block deck and we broke even after so many rounds. My not buying more recent cards doesn't mean I automatically lose every game. That's a good feeling to have.

All in all, Magic has always felt like a great experience ever since I've begun playing it (in Shards of Alara block, a three-color-based block, which isn't an easy concept for a new player to understand). Yugi-Oh just feels like something to collect.

TL;DR: Magic feels like a game that I can play with my friends and not have to put a paycheck into to stand a chance whereas Yugi-Oh felt like I have to keep funding to even come close on a casual level.",1,CHiLLSpeaks,True,t3_2d12cq,0,cjlg8iz,0,1435153306,

Oh, woops. Just channeling the commands of very excited people that have their own experiences.

I watch a lot of SCG and Pro tour to learn. I buy boosters for fun, still. I prefer to not draft, because my LGS is extremely competitive and I am not as experienced nor do I have as much time or money to commit. I prefer to goto occasional FNM's. I enjoy the sealed prereleases a lot, which aren't quite as draft-like, but are a good, and, albeit, softer intro to limited.

Get into it the way that is most comfortable to you, but I will admit, the more sealed products you buy, it can be pretty expensive. Especially after you realize there are specific cards that you ""need"" to complete that deck you saw online, or the new brew you are excited to test. Boosters just have too slim of a probability to get those specific cards.

There is no wrong way to build your collection and knowledge though. Objectivity doesn't carry into how you do your new hobby.

But I will suggest EDH/Commander as a great launch into casual, as well as a format that encourages sampling the bests of all formats. I consider it a very useful ""learning"" format for Modern and Legacy. And, despite 100 card decks, it can be relatively cheap unless you are building a competitive deck. When you can only have one copy of a very pricey card in a deck, it isn't quite as much of a burden to acquire that one copy. (Consider some multi-format allstars, like Thoughtseize, getting a playset will be over 60 USD, but only one copy might set you back around 20-25 USD.)

Part of the appeal for me to watch competitive matches online is that I can see many decks piloted that I otherwise can't afford. So, if you really need to budget yourself, that might be fun as well.",4,dbub,True,t3_2d1b28,0,cjlb4f9,0,1435150852,

* [Prospector Leveling Up](http://gfycat.com/SmallYellowAzurevasesponge) - The prospector leveling up from Expert to Master. In addition to the jetpack, the Master level packs an extra Midas gun projectile.
* [Prospector Collecting Keys &amp; Coins](http://gfycat.com/ImmaculateBrownCanary) - Here the prospector uses the Midas gun to freeze enemies and the magnet field to collect coins. He also collected the last key to unlock the portal (level exit). The gravity fields provide an extra boost to the charging speed of the prospector and pyro. I added a little sparkle animation to the UI bar when each bar recharges.

You have one (or more) bases, plus workers who build buildings and collect resources. These resources fuel additional bases (to get even *more* resources!), fund your army, and enable technology research to improve your forces.

The game usually ends up a sort of Paper/Rock/Scissors between economy, units, technology, with skill as the ""random modifier"" thrown in to throw off the equations! More economy means you can have a bigger army, but a small army early on might kill you. Better tech, however, might enable your small army to win against a larger force, but you have to sacrifice a lot of resources to afford it. A truly skilled player can use his units to their maximum potential while maintaining his economy, predicting his opponents' moves, and even performing actions to ""fake out"" a similarly skilled opponent.

Players choose between three races. Terrans get a boost to mining speed with MULEs and have a strong focus on weak, ranged infantry units early game with powerful, but expensive ""mech"" units in some late-game scenarios, including destructive Siege Tanks (massive splash damage, but they have to convert to a vulnerable stationary ""siege mode"" to do it) and massive Battlecruisers (flying death machines). Protoss focus on powerful single units that are usually expensive, hardy, and replete with special abilities. Spells like forcefield can trap enemy units, allowing towering Collossi to blast them to bits with lasers. Zergs focus on reacting to opponent plays by spawning huge, mobile armies at a moment's notice, but each unit is usually quite weak and ""single-purpose,"" like explosive, suicidal banelings that mow down infantry--if they can survive long enough to reach them.

In tournament settings, the world's top-tier players, most of whom play many hours a day for professional teams, compete against one another for glory, cash, and ""WCS Points."" Many teams have large rosters of great players, representing all three races. Some of the larger teams pay monthly salaries to their players, and some top pro's make lots and lots of money off of that and personal sponsorships.

WCS Points are scored at the biggest tournaments for high placements; earning enough qualifies players for a giant end-of-year tournament with a huge prizepool. The winner is essentially the world champion, having demonstrated great play over the course of a whole year *and* then having beaten everyone else who did the same.

Red Bull sponsor a Starcraft player (Bomber) and also run a series of tournaments, some of which have unique, but awesome formats. In this one, each player who qualified gets 3 ""lives"" and can challenge others in the tourny to Bo3 matches. The winner keeps their life and wins a small amount of cash; the loser loses a life.

Once you're out of lives, you're out of the tournament. At the end of each day, a prize pool is divided up amongst ""surviving"" players, so preserving your lives is always good! The format is cool because it encourages things like backstabbing and team-ups, which creates a fun, dramatic environment.

My wife disagrees, so I'll present the logic of the Bradley courses we took instead of my own feelings.

The problems with a C-section as the first birth is that there are many professionals who want nothing to do with VBAC.  Something about mitigating risks and malpractice issues.  

Many women want to deliver vaginally because C-sections are major surgery.  My SIL recently (like 3 weeks ago) had a C-section, and still is having difficulty walking around the house, or even getting out of bed.  Forget about going to the store for a gallon of milk or getting take-out for dinner.  

Pitocin and other interventions have some data behind them saying that when you take 1, the next is much more likely to happen.  Pitocin kick-starts your labor, but it also makes you go from maybe hour 2 of an ""ideal"" labor to like hour 12 in about 15-20 minutes*.  What does this mean?  You took a huge jump in the pain scale, so you now need something to take the edge off of the pain, so hook up the epidural.  Which can slow down contractions, so boost the pitocin... which increases labor but also pain, so boost the epidural... repeat until that diet-woman from the 1990s comes running on the screen shouting ""STOP THE INSANITY!""

Another factor is this, you get an epidural, you are laying on your back.  Period.  STOP.  Go to bed-jail.  Do not pass ""GO"", do not collect 200 bucks.  There are other positions a non-medicated woman can be in, crawling position (or doggy-style position), or squat (think Sumo wrestlers before they start a match) which uses gravity to help pull the kiddo out.  Also laboring women can walk, climb stairs, sit on a yoga-ball, or do the ""labor dance"" to help progress labor.  Nope, epidural means on your back, and the kid then has to be pushed ""uphill"" the last little bit to come out... which means other interventions such as forceps, suction, et al are now much more likely to come into play.

So, in the final analysis, some women don't want medication because medical science seems to get in the way of human birthing and questionably does more harm than good.  A documentary that covers this pretty well is ""The Business of Being Born"".  It's more about advocating use of midwives, but almost all births that use a midwife instead of an OB would be all/mostly medicine-free.  In fact as I understand it, part of the midwife training is knowing when you are getting into a bad place, and to know to send mama to a hospital for the big surgery.

One final concern, once the kiddo is born apparently our Bradley teacher (and La Leche League representative) says that women who had epidurals and other pain medications seem to pass on some of those drugs to the kid, so the kid ends up having a more difficult time learning how to start breastfeeding.

SO, if you have little/no interest in Vaginal birthing (some women I know of want a C-section), little to no interest in feeding kiddo boob-juice, then by all means, use all that modern science has to offer... otherwise consider your choices, ask questions, and get informed as much as possible.  OH, and when you start asking the OB questions, be prepared to be labeled as ""one of THOSE people"".  Whether that means engineer types who want to see the math or granola-crunching hippies, I have no idea.

TL;DR: To quote Jefferson Airplane, ""1 pill makes you larger and 1 pill makes you small..."" medications can get you on a circular pattern of counteracting each other (pitocin and epidural), which must be stressful on the body's systems, like mainlining barbituates and crack in the same syringe.  potential breast-feeding issues, and positional issues.

Mine requires two mods to work, but I'm happy with them. I have two canon Wardens, one who I want for a 'happy' DA2/DAI headcanon, and one for a 'sad' follow-up.

The sad one is a particular favourite of mine. He's a Dalish Warrior who specialises in being a Templar and Reaver. He loves Tamlen, but keeps it secret. Merril loves him, which isn't so much a secret but it's not reciprocated. His interest in becoming a Templar stems from his fascination with magic and history. He longs to learn more about the Dalish culture and genuinely sees magic as a useful tool that can help the Dalish discover their past but also for Thedas to progress forwards. However, after seeing what the mirror did to him and Tamlen, he begins to distrust it a little bit more. Merril's generally cold attitude doesn't help with this very much when looking for him. 

After becoming a Grey Warden, his interest isn't in who becomes King - yet. Instead, he focuses on gathering an army while trying to hear news of his clan. He isn't at the point of many Templars where he becomes anti-magic entirely. This is evident from the reclaiming of Warden's Keep, when he allows Avernus to live on the grounds that he no longer performs cruel tests on the Wardens and others. He also drinks the concoction. He later sides with the Templars, but takes Wynne on because he still views magic as a grey area - so far. She becomes like a surrogate mother to him, especially after he reconciles her with her lost apprentice. 

Flemeth is an interesting part for him. He doesn't agree to kill her for Morrigan's behalf, but rather because (in my headcanon) he respects her as Asha'Bellanar. He is aware that she has made deals with his people before, and so instead kills her as part of her own ritual rather than for Morrigan. (Again in my headcanon) It is from here that he gets the Reaver specialisation, as through killing her he absorbs a portion of her power.

He takes on Shale, but kills Kitty after learning that she wants to possess the little girl. This leads to a further distrust of magic. 

He also sides with Bhelen after seeing the status of the Casteless in Dust Town. He destroys the Anvil, viewing it as a dangerous form of magic. 

When we get to the Dalish elves, he forces a reconciliation between Zathrian and the Werewolves. However, when he learns what Zathrian has done, and how he was able to do it, it pushes him over the edge, viewing magic as a now-dangerous tool that can still be used for good, but only under fierce regulation. At this point, Alistair is always in his party alongside Wynne. This is only further confirmed when he reaches Redcliffe and has to stand back while Isolde kills her only son. With the Ashes quest, he kills the Cult and the High Dragon, allowing the Urn to be visiting by Pilgrims, as he hopes this will help lead to a future for the Dalish.

Finally, when they're in Denerim, he maintains that the most practical route is that Alistair and Anora should marry, and they do so. After seeing the Alienage and the Magisters, he is ready to kill Loghain, but allows him to become a Grey Warden out of punishment after Riordan convinces him. He later denies the Dark Ritual and sends Loghain marching to his death as penance instead. His request to Anora and Alistair is that the Dalish be given land. By the end, he has the Juggernaut Armour, Harvard's Axis, the Spellward and the sword Gaxhan the Unbound drops, so as to fully boost his resistance to magic.

He also tries flirting with Cammen to no avail, and sleeps with the male elven whores in the Pearl. He finally romances Zevran, but knows that the love isn't completely real, as Zevran is mostly straight. But, he's lonely and so sticks with Zevran. Upon being given his earring, he realises that the love is real.

I haven't played the DLC with him yet, but I'm planning on letting the Architect live and fulfilling the Witch Hunt with him.

This ties in to DA2 in a world where Mage MHawke and Merril form a romance, and side with the Mages. They also kill the entire clan. So now, my Warden has disappeared, hunting down the pair for revenge for destroying their clan.


Then there's the 'Happy' Ending. This is my particular favourite. I have a male Mage Cousland In it, he is a Blood Mage, but who only used it to remain unexposed by other nobility. He sleeps with Dairren, and wears 'The Lucky Stone' as a gift from him. However, he doesn't want to become a Grey Warden, and is so conscripted. His main focus is on taking revenge on Howe, and finding a way out of his conscription and back into the noble social circle. He later becomes a Spirit Healer, and focuses mainly on the Horror, Walking Bomb, Ice, Blood and Healing magic lines.

He gets into contact with the Blackstone Irregulars in Lothering, and instantly thinks of this as a way to build up a personal army. He's distrustful of Alistair, but allows Leliana to come with him after considering the prestige that having a Sister and a Templar with him will give his group, allowing him to use their credibility for protection. Sten, on the other hand, is left to rot in the cage. Cousland does't trust a Qunari, and his murder record doesn't help either.

He refuses to go to Arl Eamon without an army, just in case, so heads to Orzammar first. However, after the confrontation outside the door, he flees in case Loghain sends word. His first response is then to go to Denerim to see if he can earn any money and get mercenary work. Here he establishes connections with the Blackstones and the Collective, and uses Leliana's and Alistair's ties with the Chantry to keep up appearances. Sleeps with a couple of the male whores as well. He considers the criminal route, but opts against it - for now. 

Following that, he reclaims Warden's Peak for the strategic advantage and allows Avernus to live again, instead using his knowledge of Blood Magic to his advantage. In my head, the Blackstones and the Collective members he's hired and gained as followers reside there with the Drydens, giving him more confidence to approach Eamon. There, he saves Redcliffe, and agrees to go to the Circle. He sides with the mages and restores order, but doesn't take Wynne on. He isn't anti-Circle, but would definitely be considered a Libertarian. Returning to Redcliffe, he intimidates the Demon into giving him a boon and leaving Connor behind. However, now knowing Alistair's true lineage and Anora's marital status, he figures out a way to use it to his own advantage. He considers sleeping with Alistair, who has expressed a slight interest, but decides against it, fearing that it might complicate his plans for the time being. He also reflects that hooking up with Alistair so soon after his reveal would make Alistair suspicious of his motives. In the meantime he allows Andraste's Ashes to remain untouched, but keeps them a secret. He also kills the Cult, and Zevran. 

He then heads to Orzammar, stopping at Honnleath and killing Kitty on the way, and puts Bhelen on the Throne, though not due to the Casteless, but rather because as fellow Nobles, he sides with who he perceives as 'The Rightful Ruler'. He also sides with Branka, for no reason other than the fact that she is the one who the Orzammar Council is willing to listen to, as oposed to Caridin. He had taken Shale down with him, but after seeing that other Golems were down there, sent her back up so as to not give her the chance to turn against him. He later takes her to Cadash Thaig. 

Now with a large army of mercenaries, warriors and mages, he heads to Denerim to deal with more personal business, which is mainly Alistair and Leliana. Alistair remains unhardened, whilst Leliana becomes hardened. It is there that he learns of Ostagar's survivor, so he heads there with Alistair, Leliana and Oghren, before heading to kill Flemeth. Finally, on the way back to Denerim to turn in some bounties, he runs into the Dalish.

Recognising his own history as a Cousland in regards to the Werewolves, but also being a wise enough mage to be willing to negotiate with them, he eventually convinces Zathrian and the Lady to destroy themselves and have peace for all. He recruits both the Elves, and (headcanon) the now humans into his army. 

Finally, he murders Loghain on the spot, performs the Dark Ritual, allows Alistair to remain in the Wardens and marries Anora, becoming King of Ferelden. He also sides with the Architect later on, and hunts down Morrigan. He is followed by MHawke, who romances Fenris, and then Anders and who sides with the Mages again. In some variations of this playthrough, he makes Alistair, who he has romanced, and Anora marry and remains on as 'The Hand of the King', being with Alistair behind closed doors. He also sides with Harrowmant and allows Zevran and Sten to live. Another variant also has Alistair being romanced then killed off to the Archdemon.

* What they call ""Any%"" is really ""Any%, No OoB"" (pretty much the normal, pre-OoB route, measured in either Real Time or In-Game Time)  
* What they call ""Any% Glitched"" is really ""Any%"" (use the OoB to beat the game is less than half the time)

* What they call ""GT Classic"" is really ""Any%, No OoB, w/ the GT Cheat Code"" (code gives you unlimited powerups or something)  
* What they call ""Any% GT Code"" is actually somewhat accurate. Uses the OoB glitch and the GT Cheat Code.

* ""100% Completion Rate"" - collect all the items and beat the game. I don't believe they use OoB in this.  
* ""100% Map Completion"" - I've never seen this ran, but it sounds like it's beating the game after unveiling the entire map. I imagine they don't use OoB.

* Low% Ice Beam/XIce/Speed Booster - Each of these complete the game with the lowest possible completion rate without going out of bounds (14%). Ice Beam is the fastest route. I believe the other two are just kind of ""legacy"" categories from before the Ice Beam route was found.  
* Low% Glitched - Collects 5% of items (true low%), uses OoB.

* Reverse Boss Order - kill the bosses in reverse order and beat the game (no out of bounds)

But no time for that now, we have a new arc to tackle! And oh, shall we ever.

___

**Episode 25**:

As the, quote on nebulous quote, “curator” of this little club, I do like to witness and encourage different perspectives. And I think we’ve had more than our fair share of them, which is great! However, you must know that there are some ironclad positions I hold regarding certain elements of this show, for which I am a stubborn old goat and simply will not budge, no matter how strong the opposing argument. If you’ve been around here long enough, you might know that one of these laws is “don’t bully Ami”. On a very similar note, here is another such commandment from the Book of Nova.

*Makoto Kino, a.k.a. [Sailor Jupiter](http://www.gfycat.com/HandmadeAmazingIslandcanary), is* ***fucking awesome***. 

What, you thought my excessive fan-boying tendencies were going to be reserved exclusively for Ami? Pffft! No dice, I’m afraid. And y’know, I don’t even deem it completely necessary to have to explain why the character is so great, because the episode itself does such a thoroughly excellent job on its own, and therefore is what I consider it to be the best introduction episode a Senshi has had up to this point.

As with all main characters in Sailor Moon, there are a *lot* of small details that make up the complete picture of Makoto Kino, but I think the most central component of her character is a certain *duality*, the same dynamic that allows her to have expressions like [this](http://i.imgur.com/ok0ZPFz.png) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/UEWK5cL.png) in the same scene and have them both be completely in character. We’re introduced to the first “half” of her right at the beginning when she [beats the everloving tar](http://imgur.com/a/b5n3u) out of a gang of street toughs (!), are reminded of it in the middle when she takes on Zoisite bare-handed (!!!), and once more at the end when she seismic-tosses a goddamn youma like it was nothing *before she’s even become Sailor Jupiter* (!!!!!). These scenes tell us two crucial pieces of information about Makoto: that she’s physically powerful, and that she has absolutely zero tolerance for [bullying the frail and the innocent](http://i.imgur.com/8Q8RxkR.png). Picking on someone weaker than you in front of Makoto is like stepping in between a mother bear and her cub, except maybe the mother bear wouldn’t be *quite* as scary. And of course, we’ve been through a similar song and dance with two other Senshi before, so you know the drill: these talents and mentalities are misunderstood and serve as the basis for her ostracization, prohibiting her from making friends from the *moment* she stepped on campus.

But the other “half”, of course, is that if you approach her in any way that doesn’t involve a brawl, she’s actually, like, the nicest and most sensitive person you’ve ever met. Not only that, but she has a vested interest and talent for more traditionally feminine hobbies like cooking, gets easily swept up in fits of romance…pretty much everything you *don’t* associate with physically-intimidating types. Oh, but for someone to discover that, they would have to be a person with no regard for the hateful rumors built around her, no fear of approach, and have the ability to instantly bond with anyo-…

…wait, hey, [we have one of those!](http://i.imgur.com/vJYXrCc.png)

Everything about [the scene where Usagi and Makoto first meet](http://i.imgur.com/4s64orQ.png) (that doesn’t involve the latter wiping the floor with thugs) is absolutely wonderful. I think what strikes me most about it is how Usagi took it completely upon herself to engage, which hasn’t actually been the case up until now with the other Senshi. Luna instigated contact with Ami because she thought she was a youma. They really only kept encountering Rei because they were investigating the missing buses. But Mako? Usagi talked to Mako because *she wanted to*. The similarity, of course, is that Usagi is just as equally instantly smitten with Makoto, [recognizing and praising her personal strong points](http://imgur.com/a/BwfSX) without even really meaning to, only because that is the sort of person she is.

Basically, [Umino has never been more right about anything in his life](http://i.imgur.com/HBlD1Sh.png).

And yeah, this is a jam-packed episode even putting aside all of that, marking a tremendous shift for the show: more glimpses into the Dark Kingdom, a new objective for the villains, Zoisite finally running solo antics on Earth, a new method for defeating youma, and so on. So the fact that they were able to effortlessly shift gears on the plot while simultaneously introducing a new character so thoroughly and so *well*, never removing the critical focus from the main cast and their interactions, is a feat that should be applauded.

*MISCELLANY AND HODGE-PODGE: *

- This is the first we’ve seen and heard of the “great ruler” directly, is it not? So that’s something!

 And *dang*, if [that](http://i.imgur.com/LVofVgE.png) isn’t some legitimately creepy art and sound design. It’s like a Dan Seagrave album cover.
- [Yup.](http://i.imgur.com/mXuHxFJ.png)
- [How did you do that?](http://i.imgur.com/uLAjxjz.png) How did you even know how the *original* Black Crystal worked, let alone modify it, and to the resonance of objects you’ve *never encountered before*?

 Fine, fine, rolling with it.
- Yes, [he really does yell out “Zoi” almost every time he makes that hand gesture.](http://i.imgur.com/Ammz6eM.png)

 Is now as good a time as any to finally admit flat-out that Zoisite is my favorite villain from Classic? I suppose it is.
- Yes, yes, I’ve blathered on about this scene already, but the one detail that super-extra-special gets me here is how [Makoto reacts to Usagi’s initial approach](http://i.imgur.com/aWf0Oel.png). She’s *so* used to violence and rejection by this point that she assumes anyone coming up from behind her has bad intentions. But then the second she realizes that isn’t true, she [instantly reverts back](http://i.imgur.com/Qw8bbkl.png) to being the sweetest thing on the planet.

 This scene, guys, *this scene*.
- The [“mother” comment](http://i.imgur.com/dpfnnMy.png) is a bit of an awkward one, though. The anime never explicitly states this, but do you ever wonder *why* Makoto makes her own lunches and is so adept at taking care of herself?

 Word of God/the manga says [](/s ""because her parents are dead. Yup. Airplane accident."") 

 Self-sufficiency doesn’t always come from nothing, kids.
- OK, so the first thing I love about this *other* perfect scene where everyone is being introduced to Mako at the arcade is the reaction Ami, Rei and Luna have to [her standing up](http://www.gfycat.com/GloomyPositiveEgg). You can see their eyes follow along as it gradually dawns on them just how tall she is, and when she’s at full height their eyes widen in full realization of her complete height. Even the *camera* shifts up a notch to get the point across. This is a visual detail that lasts for less than a second and isn’t directly commented on, but it’s there.

 They didn’t have to do that. They could have had the characters stare straight, or, inversely, have them make an internal comment along the lines of “Wow, she’s so tall” if they still wanted to reinforce that information. The brief subtle touch they added instead is proof enough that someone cared. Director, animator, what-have-you…someone *gave a shit* when they were crafting this show.
- It’s not enough that Usagi [introduces Rei as “the meanie”](http://i.imgur.com/Um5kzh5.png). It’s not enough that Rei responds to this with [a smile affixed on her face](http://imgur.com/a/gKuQx), like she’s still trying to put on a good impression for Mako in spite of being *so unbelievably pissed*. It’s not enough that she explodes a second thereafter anyway, demanding that Usagi tell her [the precise chronological details of when she was mean to her](http://imgur.com/a/Cr2HA). No no, it’s the fact that [Mako immediately recognizes the truth of what is going on here](http://imgur.com/a/DbFyN) that makes it.

 Oh, and the cherry on the sundae? *Ami’s expressions*. [At first](http://i.imgur.com/rgWgrZ1.png), she’s putting on her usual, “Please, stop it, both of you, you’re being an embarrassment” face, but then after she hears Mako’s response, she starts [giggling and smiling](http://imgur.com/a/p2hb5) like we’ve never seen her before.

 Ami has known this girl for *less than a minute* and she is enjoying her company *already*.

 *Everyone is so perfect in this episode, am dying, please send help.*
- [It got better](http://i.imgur.com/pE1hImI.png). Somehow, it keeps getting better.
- Bonus detail: when Makoto bends close to Ami to pet Luna, Ami suddenly [blushes *really hard*](http://i.imgur.com/Vpaq3ma.png) and stares. It lingers on this shot for, like, two seconds.

 Look…I’m not *saying*, alright? I’m just…

 Oh who am I kidding, that’s [exactly](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneTruePairing) what I’m [saying](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShippingGoggles).
- At last, [an Ami doll](http://i.imgur.com/uiImhF5.png)! We’re gradually rounding out the collection of improbable Senshi merchandise!
- [Holy filter effects, Batman](http://i.imgur.com/yCklSBK.png).
- I just need to reiterate here that Makoto saw a floating wizard attacking a stranger and immediately decided to [charge right in and stop him](http://i.imgur.com/y69v9aK.png), in the process becoming the only person to making throwing an earring at someone look badass. And she actually [landed a hit](http://imgur.com/a/ZPFsK) and forced him to retreat.

 *This is a third-tier miniboss.*

 *This is a Dark Kingdom general, the same kind of villain the Senshi have been struggling to fight every step of the way.*

 *And she managed to cause damage to one* ***without even transforming first.***

 Like I said at the start, different perspectives and all, but if you do not love this character already then you simply must know that you and I are *very* different people.
- An analysis of Usagi reacting to dangerous scenarios over time:

 [Episode 10.](http://imgur.com/a/gSAsE)

 [Episode 25.](http://imgur.com/a/gE5Kp)

 Conclusion: yes.
- [(*spastic, ineffectual flailing at keyboard*)](http://imgur.com/a/64XKK)

 How I am supposed to improve upon that through writing, guys? *What am I supposed to do?*
- [Senpai is legitimately more evil than the Dark Kingdom.](http://i.imgur.com/z6XzXJ4.png)

 Seriously, dude. Fuck’s wrong with you.
- Usagi is taking it on herself to be Makoto’s life coach and get her to [follow her heart](http://imgur.com/a/whQfm). This in spite of the fact that she just confessed that she personally found the guy Mako was crushing on to be [a jerk](http://i.imgur.com/PDwqk1g.png).

 Usagi has known Makoto for less than a day. And she is already *that* invested in her hopes and dreams.

 *Because Usagi*.

 *Everything is in-character and nothing hurts*.
- I do like how Makoto’s opinion of Crane Game Joe *instantly* drops a little when she learns he’s effectively been [cheating](http://i.imgur.com/pjS1sa7.png). She’s lovestruck, of course, but she isn’t stupid.

 Still hasn’t noticed that he has [six fingers](http://i.imgur.com/DFJk7ON.png), though.
- [Oh god I have a terrible interpretation of what this is supposed to mean.](http://imgur.com/a/Taqpt)

 I think the reason Makoto doubled back on her order is because she thought scarfing down a plate of curry wouldn’t be as “feminine” as a single milk tea, and she wanted to make a good impression for Joe. That is the extent of her current insecurities about her femininity.

 Damn it, Makoto, on top of everything else you’re *already* going to make me feel sad and sympathetic for you, too? *Must you cover all of the bases at once*?
- I’ve been putting off the obvious all this time, but yeah, [Crane Game Joe is a total asshat](http://i.imgur.com/rkiMnd9.png). Usagi was dead on about him.
- [Zoisite doesn’t have to do this.](http://www.gfycat.com/ScentedHelplessGreatdane) If anything, he would be moving *faster* if he just ran normally. But he is having *so much fun* being an evil prick right now that he can’t help but bouncily teleport-skip around.

 Every time I don’t think this episode can get any better. *Every time*.
- [Makoto stop. STOP. FEELINGS.](http://i.imgur.com/RzlYnl4.png)
- Gesen is the first male youma to appear in the show. Hooray for, umm, gender equality, I guess.
- [This is what my angry fan-letters to Toei regarding Crystal are like](http://i.imgur.com/dNpDsfc.png).

 Sorry, sorry. I will stop making Crystal jokes…when they stop being so easy.
- [Yup. Again.](http://i.imgur.com/4HIcZVt.png)

 Actually, do think about this. Usagi is still expressing amazement at Makoto’s abilities…while she’s *Sailor friggin’ Moon*. She has magical superpowers right now, and apparently an entire merchandising empire being built around her, and yet she still looks up to and respects this girl just as much as when she saved her from street toughs.

 Usagi’s capacity for being constantly impressed by how awesome her friends are is *endless*.
- I’ve had a GIF for every other major attack sequence so far. I’m certainly not stopping at [Supreme Thunder](http://www.gfycat.com/DimGiganticImpala).

 Curious how Jupiter is the only one to ever preface her attack with a sort of [“summons”](http://imgur.com/a/ljliX) from her guardian. Considering that her ability descends from the sky instead of being directly generated from her hands like Mars or Mercury, I think it’s a nice touch.

 Plus, y’know…throwing the horns. [Rock on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc7S0y5Xyt8)
- [I love this episode so very much.](http://i.imgur.com/t890cJF.png)
- Oh yeah, [new ability for Sailor Moon](http://gfycat.com/IndolentUntimelyArkshell), as well! Less murder, more healing. I’m OK with that.

 I will *never* find people yelling [“Refresh!”](http://i.imgur.com/kJkRAho.png) not amusing, by the way. It puts a smile on my face every time. I don’t even know why.
- [This](http://imgur.com/a/S6EMY) does cease to make sense the more you dwell on it, though. Usagi’s ownership of the Moon Stick is proof of her leadership…even though Luna’s the one who gave it to her to begin with. This ain’t exactly Excalibur.
- [No comment.](http://i.imgur.com/Ri77kXA.png)
- [Uh-oh](http://i.imgur.com/XNnhpxl.png), [I sense a running gag!](http://i.imgur.com/khNp9kg.png)

 *Aaaaaand* scene. *Damn*, that was even better than I remembered it.

**Episode 26** 

Oh man, I was so caught up in Jupiter showing up that I sort of forgot that we had to give some closure to the whole “Naru in a state of chronic depression” thing. And far as that need extends, I’d say this episode does fairly well. Without drowning the episode in sorrow, it lightly touches upon the grieving someone like Naru would be going through and providing an outlet through which they can manage to move on, incorporating Usagi well as (what else?) the continuously supportive friend. The episode also sets up a lot of important story concepts for the remainder of this arc, contains *the best youma yet* (yes, yes he is, more on that later) and grants us the hitherto-unforeseen glorious appearance of ACTION UMINO.

But in spite of all that, I have to come down from my episode 25 high and state that there’s a lot I dislike about episode 26. And if really good characterization is my personal favorite attribute of the series, you would unsurprised to learn that the source of my ill will stems from the actually-really bad and *retrograde* characterization that takes place here.

Alongside the wrapping up of business with Naru’s subplot is the runner of the other character’s reactions to be Usagi being “christened” as the leader of the Sailor Soldiers. Frankly, I think the way the characters are written in order to generate conflict and drama under these circumstances is very much incongruent with what we’ve learned of them up until now. Luna, for one thing, has been re-designated as Usagi’s #1 Cheerleader, and while you’d think I’d be in favor of that, the fact is that when she states that she [“trusts Usagi”](http://i.imgur.com/0eazB1w.png), *I don’t believe her*. There is *way* too much evidence against her on that front, even in recent episodes (one might say, *especially* in recent episodes, given Usagi’s demonstrable improvement as a heroine and Luna’s apparent inability to recognize it). To accommodate this drastic change, Rei has to be reframed as the voice of utter opposition, which is equally blunt and out-of-character; I can see her having doubts, and she’d never admit of whatever optimism she has of Usagi right to her face for sure, but having effectively state that she is *beyond help* crosses the line more than once. Was it not too long ago that she trusted in Usagi to make the right choice regarding how to handle the Naru situation, for example, despite having a very adamant stance on the matter of her own? Ami seems more on point, but even she has her initial outlook cruelly forced into changing by Rei in a sequence so stupid that it gets its own “M&amp;HP Bulletpoint™”.

I like what they’re *going for* in the episode, mind: examining the character’s relationships to Usagi in light of the idea that she’s being elevated to the level of leader, all while Makoto is being integrated into the group and piecing together more and more what she thinks of Usagi herself. But the execution misses the mark, I think, and I think it puts a bit of a downer on the episode’s other successes.


*MISCELLANY AND HODGE-PODGE:*

- What I like about this arc is…well, OK, there are many things I like about this arc, but one of the big ones is that it [grants a purpose and motivation to Mamoru](http://i.imgur.com/JpNTaIu.png). Not just to Tuxedo Mask, mind you, but to the everyman underneath who’s been suffering from mysterious dreams and more than little bit of an [identity crisis](http://i.imgur.com/XinMImV.png). He isn’t just a vestigial thematic hanger-on  to the proceedings anymore: he’s a third-party to the conflict with his own agenda and wants and needs.
- Hoo boy, isn’t it great that we get to watch [this scene](http://i.imgur.com/CAaSzAU.png) again! Thanks, episode! Thanks for that!

 In all seriousness, one of my other issues with 26 is its transparent need to pad out the runtime with flashbacks and exposition. 25 was so jam-packed with content that the showrunners were comfortable with axing the otherwise universally-applied-up-to-now henshin sequence. Here, they have to *find* ways to kill time.
- I’m electing to believe that Usagi at least *attempted* to visit or otherwise contact Naru at some point before *a week* passed. I dunno, somehow I can’t see her letting a close friend to stew in her own grief for that long.
- [Umino: denser than a neutron star.](http://imgur.com/a/mbKvc) Also, [extraordinarily bad at coincidental word choice and activity recommendation.](http://imgur.com/a/I3glk) 
- [“The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Moon.”](http://i.imgur.com/z7ABR9P.png)
- Again, piling on to evidence of Luna’s veiled incompetency, she’s framing all of this information as gossip and rumors she heard “long ago”. This, of course, is followed by a lengthy recap of information we learned *last episode*.

 I mean, I know Sailor Moon isn’t above inserting reminders to the audience about what the overall goals of the protagonists and antagonists are meant to be (“Find the princess!”, “Find the Silver Crystal!”, and so on), but this was *just* explained to us, and somehow they deemed it necessary to review it again in excruciating detail. Because again…”killing time” seems to be a priority in 26.
- Removed from the context that Rei’s objections are now being rooted in some sort of double-reinforced lack of faith in Usagi’s ability, [I do like this](http://imgur.com/a/7Og4V). It’s another thing entirely for Rei to merely conjecture that she wouldn’t handle the ancient magic-slingin’ artifact as delicately as it should be. Ami knows just as well, but softens the blow. And the best part is not only that they’ve been around Usagi enough to come to this exact conclusion, but that they’re both totally, totally right.
- Not to continuously harp on this point after I already brought it up in the main summary, but I really just can’t comprehend [this](http://imgur.com/a/tPAVN). 

 Flash back to episode 4. Remember when Luna basically had to threaten Usagi with violence to get her to take action. Later in *this* episode she does the [*exact opposite thing*](http://i.imgur.com/M11hBOL.png), and by the end of it Luna is *still* [disappointed in her](http://imgur.com/a/5GsRR). It’s like Usagi just can’t win. What exactly was Luna expecting, for her to sit on her hands while Naru *died*? What kind of confidence booster  would *that* be?

 I mean, OK, you want to improve Usagi’s self-esteem. That’s nice! How about you start by not *belittling her every step of the way like you’ve doing for pretty much the entire Nephrite arc*! The way I see it, either Luna is written out-of-character in this episode, *or* she’s a massive hypocrite. Pick your poison, I guess.
- So, here’s the centerpiece of everything *else* that is wrong with the character writing in this episode: [Rei pinches the shit out of Ami’s leg](http://imgur.com/a/CXqXJ).

 Back in episode 12 I noticed Rei utilizing a lot of abrasive body language towards others, Ami included. But that was more about a lack of understanding in how to deal with people than any sort of malice, and more importantly, it’s been *a while* since then. And one of things we’ve seen come from that is a certain understanding and bond between Rei and Ami. Rei *respects* Ami’s opinion, and while she herself is very vocal and passionate about her own beliefs, that is the full extent of it: vocal. She would *not* resort to physical coercion against Ami in any way, shape or form, nor would she *smile* while she did it.

 And if that were as far as it went, that would be troubling enough. But what really clinches the sourness of this moment for me is that *Makoto is sitting right the fuck across these two when it happens*. And we know from just one episode prior that Makoto *does not put up with this shit*.

 So one of two things if happening here: either Makoto is being written to not care when people are being physically abused, or Rei is being written to be so underhanded that she would sneakily *hide* this action from Makoto just to get what she wanted. And no, no, no, neither of these things makes any sense to me at all. Bad scene! Bad writing! *Boo!*
- I may have my issues with the writing in this episode, and Akira Nakamura probably ranks among my least favorite animation directors in the series, but even I’ll concede that this episode has some [pretty great](http://i.imgur.com/GoO1nZS.png) [reaction faces](http://i.imgur.com/I090TW4.png).
- [Kinda makes you wonder](http://imgur.com/a/3EHQZ): what exactly *does* happen to someone like Nephrite when they die? Humanity has collectively had a hard enough time attempting to parse what happens to *us*, let alone denizens of the Dark Kingdom. What kind of religion would provide an escape clause for minions of evil to cross into the pleasantries of an afterlife, if there is one? Do youma even have burial rights? I guess not, because they’re effectively immortal unless they get tiara’d, right?

 /r/TrueAnime’s Sailor Moon club: come for the jokes, stay for the serious contemplation of spiritual quandaries.
- Like I said before, I do really like the exchange between Naru and the priest in the graveyard. It’s a short scene, a few quick lines of dialogue at best, but it’s really all that was needed to provide Naru with the push to overcome her sorrow. It seems like a real conversation someone might have when reaching out to a man of the faith.

 My one concern? [What kind of priest has hair like that?](http://i.imgur.com/eRnqDnE.png) It’s like he was raised in the same sect as Giovanni from Highlander: The Source.
- [Zoisite: kind of a dick](http://imgur.com/a/AQ1eV).
- Oh no, the Moon Stick *beeps*? This is even worse than the “Pokemon battle at low HP” chime!
- [This is a fine little detail](http://i.imgur.com/4EnM3pf.png); even in the presence of the man who murdered someone she loved and is effectively *gloating about it to her face*, Naru doesn’t succumb to thoughts of violent revenge. The only thought on her mind is that she doesn’t want what happened to her and Nephrite to happen to anyone else.
- [Everything about this is impossible](http://i.imgur.com/9yINi1y.png).
- Alright, so…let’s talk about [Boxy](http://i.imgur.com/W7NRPug.png). I’m genuinely unsure what the general reception towards this guy is going to be, as I suspect it could go either way. But let me throw up a preemptive defense just in case.

 We’ve had our fun mocking some of the goofier monsters that have popped up from time to time. And I suspect this is partially because said monsters are still presented with the intent of being some kind of *threat* to our heroes. The Jadeite era is interesting in that regard, for our heroine is at her most vulnerable early stages, and the youma reflect this by being more (ostensibly) terrifying in appearance and demeanor.

 But it’s been 26 episodes. Nobody is being fooled by this point that even one of the “Seven Great Youma” could feasibly slay our heroes. So at that point…well, why *not* have him be a mustachioed demonic Harvey Birdman wearing boxing gear and a bell-adorned belt, proclaiming his [championship](http://i.imgur.com/nUByU7Y.png) [status](http://i.imgur.com/gTo4NvX.png) and [announcing his attacks](http://i.imgur.com/olfGBFA.png) in exuberant broken English? Why not, indeed, have the youma be *entertaining*, moreso than frightening? That’s what the silliest of monsters in Sailor Moon are to me, at their best: *entertaining*.

 Usagi’s reaction is [perfect](http://i.imgur.com/qpVyA3E.png), by the way. 
- I must stress again the infinite wellspring of awesome that is [ACTION UMINO](http://i.imgur.com/zeqY19k.png).

 Y’know, Umino actually does appear to have a little spark of “Usaginess” in him. He’s obnoxious, he’s socially daft, he’s even a little bit of a perv (remember when he was sneaking pictures of his teacher working out at the gym?), but when the chips are down and someone’s in danger, he’ll charge in at the risk of his own life regardless.
- [Zoisite does not appreciate having other people’s beliefs foisted upon him.](http://imgur.com/a/QNbTc)
- [It is impossible for anyone to be as pleased with himself any more than Tuxedo Mask is right now.](http://i.imgur.com/ZIhKhnm.png)

 My god, that face and the laugh that goes with it is just sublime. As is his exit line of [“I got what I wanted, suckas! I’m out!”](http://i.imgur.com/ley4i9P.png)
- Well, [there goes the barrier](http://imgur.com/a/j7XYU). To the best of my recollection, this where Mamoru and Tuxedo Mask cease to be even remotely considered two separate entities. And it’s about friggin’ time.

 “Finally, my memories are returning to me! At last I can…wait a second. I did *what* to a girl? While she was *what*?”

Let's cut to the chase. Will keep a running total of remaining Credits by section. Freebies listed in *(parentheses)*

**Training:**
*Medical Degree* - *Trader's Apprenticeship* - *(Driver's License)* | 13k (+.5k)

The first two are absolutely essential to me if I'm stuck in some unfamiliar corner of the universe. Being able to help people not be sick, injured or dead will get me brownie points just about anywhere...and let's not forget that even though the human body is pretty amazing, *alien* bodies have got to be just mind-blowingly cool! The free med station and extra pocket change don't exactly hurt either.

Of course, knowing what to do with that extra cash isn't going to be easy. Neither is knowing where I can find what I want. Thankfully, not knowing isn't too big a problem if you know *how* to know. Trade is the life of any civilization and it's a skill that will make almost everything I do a little bit easier. Plus, while not getting swindled is generally a good thing, getting a killer deal is even better.

Understanding the basics of operating any kind of vehicle will help me get around better, and in more places. Permission to do something other than walk or take public transportation (if available) in urban locations sounds like a good deal to me. Navigating undeveloped areas with my own skill is just as good - better if I'm fleeing for my life. And besides, what's the use of owning a ship if I have to let someone else pilot it?

**Ship:** *Gravship [Discount 1]* | 11.11k

Comfy, quick, tough and free of suspicious armaments, this looks like *the* ship for for any non-aggressive interstellar business. Probably a lot easier to get access to civilized locations without sporting railguns up the ass, and frankly space is too big to be worrying about random ambushes mid-flight. Besides, chances are this baby can take a couple hits before outrunning anything beefy enough to put up a fight. I'm also assuming ""mild disabling weapons"" means being an annoying prick and screwing with hostile ship's normal functioning, without being able to cause any significant damage, which is just fine for me.

**Vehicles:** *Armoured Gravcar [Discount 2]* | 9.11k

Of course, this all puts me in a difficult position. I'm a medic with an itch for alien biology, so I need work...but I also own a spaceship, which means there's no way in hell I'm staying in one place long enough to find it. Obvious solution? Put that trading skill to use and deal in medical goods! Sure it could be dangerous...but with the right crew and some good equipment we can make it happen. And in the tragic event one of us does get hurt, they know I've got their back. And front. And...pretty much every other part of their body really, I'm not picky.

**Armour/Attire:** *(Standard Issue Jumpsuit)* - *(Modern Local Attire)* - *(Environmental Suit)* | 9.11k

Lots of freebies here. *Useful* freebies at that. Pretty sure I'm all set!

**Weapons:** *Plasma Pistol* - *Machine Pistol* - *Custom Melee* | 8.36k

Let's face it...I've gotta defend myself. Even if somehow I never need them, there's no reason not to carry a little firepower just in case things get rough. Between an energy and a ballistic weapon I should be able to handle most kinds of defense - though they're more deterrent than anything, and a small energy knife ought to compliment another little upgrade I'll be purchasing soon...not to mention cauterizing wounds in a pinch.

**Personal Misc/Other:** *Blink Implant [Discount 3]* - *Holodisk: 27* - *Scanning Wand* - *Symbiote: All* | 4.51k

Here's where things get pricey. I spread my skills out thin, so I need a little holodisk support. Won't go through the whole list, but there's some human and xeno A&amp;P, pharmaceuticals &amp; chemistry, bit of alien languages &amp; culture...you get the idea.

There's absolutely no reason not to have a scanning wand on me at all times. Simple as that.

The Blink Implant isn't essential, strictly speaking, but even if it only saves my life once it'll still have saved my life. Plus between it, the knife and the symbiotes I'll have a bunch of advantages in case of danger of any sort.

And of course the symbiotes. I'm not comfortable experimenting on other people's bodies...unless, y'know, they're totally down. Because I'm totally down if you are. On myself though? Hell yeah. Gimme those parasites. It's not that I have something against being human, but there's way too much out there for me to settle. 

I imagine the Healer symbiote offering some minor regenerative ability, along with perhaps some (maybe all?) antibiotic, antiseptic, analgesic and/or anesthetic secretions. The defense symbiote would probably produce natural keratinized (or, dare I hope, ossified?) armor for me grown in rough patches or plates on the surface of my body, along with general reinforcement of connective tissues. Offense strikes me (hahaha...ha...aheh) as something other than claws or fangs. Maybe hidden poison barbs or some projectile chemical (or chemical reaction?) or simply a boost to muscle strength / response.

The Symbiotic appendage is the fun part though. I imagine this as a long tentacle-ish thing that can ingest and metabolize stuff that my normal human body wouldn't have a chance with. Maybe I can get it to replace my tongue...for uh...purely practical reasons, of course.

**Ship/Vehicle/Crew Misc/Other:** *A.I. [Discount 4]* - *2 Drones* - *3 Entertainment Systems* - *Galactic Chart* - *Mega Drugs* - *Gatling Turret [Gravcar]* - *Holocomm* |2.56k

Some of these are self-explanatory. Holocomm &amp; Chart are basic logistical tools, A.I. seems pretty essential for keeping a spaceship running, and Drones are the first line of defense / alarm system if something or someone goes for our ship.

The Mega Drugs, if their description is true, are basically a set of exotic backup medical tools. Goes without saying I'd want them around. For purely practical reasons. Again. Really.

Entertainment covers the Internet, Music and Workout options. Hell, those three alone would be enough to kill all of my free time even without five other people sharing the same shipspace as me. Life's gonna be good.

The gatling turret is for our Gravcar. Anything heavy enough to take it won't be fast enough to run us down, and anything quick enough to keep up won't be too happy with a wild flurry of bullets. Again, mostly deterrent...but you never know.

**Remaining Credits**
What's left over will be saved. Eventually I'll invest in some more advanced medical equipment for myself, once we have the funds and I've gotten more experience with it. And, of course, similar goodies for my crewmates. I can imagine I'm not the only one with goals and aspirations.

**Companions**

Here's the best part. Whose coming along for the ride?

*Tzarva the Overwhelming*

I want Tzarva snuggles. If I could choose only one companion, he would be the one. We could hang out all the time and I'd love every second of it. Plus, eventually I could probably use all that acid to help synthesize life-saving (not to mention valuable) medical compounds, once I'm good enough. Bet he never thought that stuff would end up healing people! Of course, I'll have to be *pretty thorough* when I'm collecting. Wouldn't want to miss any other useful secretions!

*Nayu Keeplep*

I might have wild, unnatural physical modifications that could help turn me into a half-decent fighter with the right training, but I'm a scholar at heart. It'll be nice to have someone around who I can get technical with, to bounce ideas off of, and generally help me learn more. Thankfully I'm pretty good-natured most of the time. I can deal with arrogance as long as they mean well. Plus we need a good engineer. I wonder what his EEG might look like in REM...do greys have REM? Do they even sleep? Maybe I should take a peek.

*Blitzen Frrel*

And speaking of training, maybe this guy might be willing to give me some pointers...Sounds like an all-around cool person, plus we can take turns cooking. Add his imposing presence and keen ears, and the two of us could make pretty shrewd deals working in tandem. Not to mention being the bane of anyone who tries to break in and steal our cargo. You know...I bet there's more to those ears than just good hearing. Most living things have some *really* fun stuff going on with their sense organs...

*Augo Asteraceae*

People who know people are people I want to know. Augo knows people. Therefore Augo is people I want to know. Bam. Deductive reasoning. Also holy shit a talking plant. If he wants to watch me shower that's totally cool...but I'd better get to do something *just* as invasive in return. Fair's fair after all, and who knows? What I learn could even save his life someday!

*Yafftess the Gold*

I've got some trading knowhow, but I can't spend all of my time running a business. There's research to do! Training to finish! Plant-person-privacy to reciprocally violate! Thankfully, Yafftess seems more than a little capable of handling money. That spiritual stuff is a little over my head, but it clearly does her well. Might there be something physiological going on when she gets into all that? If we invested in some half-decent functional imaging equipment I could spend days observing her! Good thing gold is non-ferrous, it'll probably be easier to convince her if she doesn't need to strip...at least not for that test.

**Citizenship**

*Windigo*

I don't imagine we'll be spending tons of time there, but it sounds like an ideal place to bunk up and take a breather now and again. Any of the more sophisticated medical devices I end up with will be extra helpful in a place like that. Lots of other like-minded people, with plenty of resources to learn from and past research to pour over!",2,ALSOsinceborn,True,t3_2bzpj4,0,cjk2x4g,0,1435129418,
0,,t1_cjjw939,1,1407446456,,t3_2cfhbn,False,MineDefense,False,,t5_31lw2,"I was thinking for some time, and I got some ideas. At the moments gems are very important, and goblins are pretty useless. How about a new upgrade (or building) that gives goblins a chance to collect gems similar to what delving mages have so far? That could create a problem with balancing in which the players change gems to goblins just to change the gems they get into more goblins until eventually you're drowning in gems and goblins.

I can think of two ways to solve it. The first way is to simply cap the amount of gems you can get with this method like you did with the upgrade 'HEART!'.

The second way brings a new idea for one new buildings. It's only possible to get a max of so many units. After that it's required to upgrade the building and with it the unit cap. It could also possible to create one of those buildings for every individual unit.

To expand on that second idea for a special building for every unit type, it can be pretty boring to make it just increase the unit cap and maybe provide a boost to gold gathered. It could also provide some special abilities. Maybe the bloodhounds could help defending the mine, the goblins could find gems (as mentioned earlier), the rock golems and the wyvern already have a building and the hive queens could have a chance to make something different than ants.",1,Vanderwaal1,True,t3_2cfhbn,0,cjjw939,0,1435125691,

The outgoing President didn't seem too upset about the end of his term. But hey, it sure seemed like alot of weight off your shoulders. Jim could't help but wonder if he was really ready to assume the presidency of the United States, but hey, once you've won the election there's not much time for doubt, is there?


""Thanks. It's just been incredible, of course, I've got some big ideas."" said the winner of the 2032 election.


The older man chuckled.


""Of course you do Mr. Campbell. We all start out with those, just wait till you have to deal with congress. Now, before your inauguration, there's a few things that you'll nee to know; some things that you probably...weren't aware of when you started looking for the job."" said the outgoing president, his tone becoming much more serious.


Soon-to-be-President Campbell's curiosity was piqued.


""What? Is it aliens, Area 51, Free Mason, nuclear launch code stuff?"" he asked.


The other gentleman laughed again.


""No, no. You'll deal with enough of that when you're on the job. This information relates a little more directly to yourself. Come with me.""


He walked over to a small corner bookshelf in the Oval Office, and reached for a red volume on the end. A small click was just audible, and a section of the floor retracted, revealing a stairwell.


""Pretty neat, huh? More clandestine than the Situation Room. AS you'd know, this is the most secure building in the country, perhaps the world, though I think the late Mr. Putin made a few renovations over in the Kremlin himself. Let's go."" he said, as he led Campbell down the staircase.


He saluted the armed guards at the bottom of the staircase, who opened a door to allow them to pass. The old President navigated a labyrinth of security before they reached a final door.


""I'd like you to take a minute to compose yourself, because you may not be entirely comfortable with what you're about to see and learn. And no, this is absolutely not some kind of joke.""


The door opened and they passed through into a subterranean bunker with the looks of a luxury resort. The space looked to extend for what must surely have been acres; trees grew, and it looked as if there was a small sized lake or pond not far away.


""What the hell is this place?"" asked Jim Campbell, mouth agape.


""This, sir, is the Presidential retirement estate, and you're not going to believe the residents, either. Follow me."" said the President.


The two walked over to a beach chair, where a very elderly looking man lay, in a vegetative state.


""Lyndon? Lyndon?"" said the President quietly.


The old man stirred slightly. ""Err, what? Who's there? Leave me alone? Are we out of Vietnam yet?""


The President looked down at the man piteously. ""Of course Lyndon, and Great Society is going well also.""


""Of course it is. Boy, we sure showed those commies..."" the elderly man muttered as he drifted off to sleep again.


The President looked up at Campbell. ""This man,"" he began, ""is Lyndon Johnson, 36th President of the United States, and the first full time resident of the estate.""


""What? Are you telling me that I'm looking at a man who's been dead for more than 70 years?"" he said, incredulous.


""Well, that's just the thing. He's been alive, the whole time. So have all the others."" he paused. ""After John F. Kennedy was killed in Dallas, there was concern. Such attempts, it seemed, could only become more common. So changes were made. Treatments, highly experimental, to make our presidents safer, more resilient and..."" he trailed off.


""And what!?"" Campbell demanded. This seemed like lunacy, but presuming this wasn't the strangest dream (well, maybe second strangest) he'd ever had, he wanted to know the answers.


""Well, that's the thing...they're sort of, well, I suppose you could say nearly immortal. Not immortal, mind you, they do die, it just hasn't happened yet. I'm sorry, one minute."" he asked, and tried to collect himself.


""Okay. So, these treatments altered the very DNA of the presidents. Their health improved, metabolism boosted, effects of aging slowed. Their bodies; and my own, were given an incredible ability to repair tissue damage. A gunshot wound will heal on it's own within a day. Massive wounds will coagulate and close. Reagan surviving the assassination attempt? He wouldn't have if he were normal. These are, essentially, supermen."" he said.


""Then why is Lyndon B. Johnson senile?"" asked Campbell.


""He was the very first to receive the treatment. It was in it's earliest and most experimental stages. It's a flaw that's notable in some of the earlier treatments. You'll see."" the President explained. ""Come with me.""

Richard Nixon appeared in no better condition than Johnson. Worse, perhaps. He murmured, repeatedly, ""Not a crook, Not a crook"" until distracted with a Charleston Chew. Ronald Reagan attempted to tear down the wall of cabana, until a staff member sat him down.


""Poor Ronald, so old when he received the first round of treatment, he hasn't been the same.""


""So these treatments, are for presidents alone?"" asked Campbell.


""Yes, the secrecy must be maintained, it's the same reason why the former presidents can't go wandering about the streets up there. It's the same reason why after a few decades of retirement I'll be here. And so will you."" he said.


A tennis ball landed between them.


""Over here please!"" someone shouted.


The President threw the ball back to Bill Clinton. Who tossed it to George H.W. Bush.


""Your serve George, game point, is it?""


""Shut up Bill, it's my game to lose.""


Barack Obama and George W. Bush were in the middle of a heated golf game; while Gerald Ford relaxed with a can of beer in the swimming pool.


""So I'll end up living here, for how long?"" asked Campbell.


""Well, Johnson's made it for 70. We'll doubtless last longer."" said the President.


""That's quite a bit of time to kill..."" trailed Campbell.


""The price we pay."" answered the outgoing President with a shrug. ""But it's a nice place, and the wifi's free if you want it. Once tennis has gotten old, well, at least there's reddit. Now if you're sure you'll go through with this, then it's time to see the doctors.""


Campbell considered for a moment. ""Alright then, let's go.""",2,Pvt_Larry,True,t3_2cwedt,0,cjjs2ey,0,1435123762,

It had received orders to divert course and exit the Transwarp Hub, but encountered heavy Subspace turbulence before it reached its new exit. The turbulence had knocked out power to many systems, and critically damaged several others. Many Drones had perished, and would need to be replaced. Communications were offline, and therefore, 86414 could not contact the Collective. Navigational systems had taken a beating too, and reported the ship was nowhere near its target destination of Sol. 86414 weighed its options. Unable to determine its location, and cut off from the collective, it elected to start repairs.   
Short range sensors detected a large debris field, but investigation could wait. Contacting the Collective, and therefore repairs, was more important.

---  

“What is that thing?”  
General Aetris, captain of the Star Destroyer* Vengeance*, was staring out his viewscreen, in awe of the giant cube adrift on the other side of the asteroid field.  
“I have no idea, sir,” replied one of his lieutenants, “It doesn’t match any known vessel configuration. Our sensors can’t even tell what it’s made of.”  
Aetris was concerned. This ship, if it was even a ship, had magically appeared in the system without warning. He knew the Rebels had plans for a larger, more powerful vessel, but the sheer size of this cube ruled out Rebel involvement. They wouldn’t have the resources to build something even a tiny fraction of its size.   
“Take us in for a closer look, slowly. Keep weapons and fighters on alert.” He ordered. At the very least, he wanted to know if he could capture it. Such a prize would be very valuable to the Emperor.
  
---

86414 watched as the curious vessel approached. Scans showed the vessel was well armed, but relatively harmless. The vast array of Lasers would do nothing but raise the hull temperature a few degrees. There was a secondary type of weapon 86414 couldn’t identify, but it appeared similar in configuration to a Federation Phasor. It would not take long to adapt. Still, 86414 was content to ignore the vessel; repairs were almost complete. Navigation had determined that the Subspace turbulence had thrown 86414 almost three and a half galaxies past Sol. This data would certainly be useful to the Collective if it meant improving drive efficiency or developing faster technology. 86414 began to power up primary systems, and turned to leave. It would be a long journey back to the Delta Quadrant.

However, before it could engage the engines, a tractor beam lashed out from the tiny, wedge-shaped ship, holding the cube in place.

---

“Keep it there!” Aetris ordered. He wanted whatever secrets this massive cube held.  
“I’m trying! It’s taking almost all of our emitters just to keep this thing from rotating! Whatever this thing is, it’s certainly not interested in staying here,” the lieutenant responded, furiously pushing buttons on his console.  

Almost as if it had heard him, the cube stopped moving. It hung in space, almost staring down the Vengeance, as if daring it to try to keep it from leaving. External lights blinked ominously, and Aetris paused to wonder if it had been such a good idea to investigate this giant cube.  

For a tense moment, no one moved or spoke, watching for a sign of action. Without warning, a powerful energy beam lashed out from the cube, carving a circular hole through the middle of the *Vengeance*. A powerful tractor beam followed, rending the circular hull sections free from the ship. The hull section was pulled into the cube through an airlock on the side, leaving a gaping hole four decks deep. If Aetris hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, he would never have believed something could cut right through the hull of a Star Destroyer.  

“All Hands, open fire!” he ordered. He was not going to accept this kind of damage and leave without causing some of his own. “All wings, all batteries. Let that thing know just how powerful the Empire is!”  

He watched as fleets of fighter and dozens of cannons lit up the face of the monstrous metal cube, satisfied that his weapons would overwhelm his target. As he turned back to his Captain’s Chair, the *Vengeance* was racked with a short series of weapons blasts. Aetris was thrown to the floor, landing hard, making his vision blur. A voice overrode the Comm systems, blaring throughout the ship.  

“WE ARE THE BORG. YOUR TECHNOLOGICAL SYSTEMS WILL BE ADAPTED TO SERVE US. YOUR CULTURAL DISTINCTIVENESS WILL BE ADDED TO OUR OWN. YOU WILL BE ASSIMILATED. RESISTANCE IS FUTILE.”  

Aetris watched in horror as three humanoid figures appeared out of nowhere on his Bridge. They were terrifying, more machine than organism. These monsters quickly spread about the Bridge, jabbing crew members in the neck with a pair of metal rods protruding from the space where a normal hand would have been. Affected crew members screamed in pain as cybernetic parts suddenly grew on their arms, legs, and even faces.  

Aetris stood, reaching for his blaster, but before he could reach it, he felt a metal hand on his shoulder, and a jab in the neck.

86414 analyzed the data it had learned from the new drones. It had learned a great many things. Firstly, it learned of a race of beings called the Jedi, which were capable of shaping reality to their Will via something called the Force. These Jedi, and this Force, would be valuable assets to the collective.
Second, it had learned that the debris field just outside had once been a planet call Alderaan, reduced to rubble by a space station with immense power. This station must be assimilated, 86414 reasoned. A weapon as powerful as such would boost the Collective in unimaginable ways.
Thirdly, it had learned the location of both of these new wonders. They were in a small system not too far away, in orbit of a planet called ‘Endor’. 86414 plotted a new course. The journey home could wait.

So, I'll just say, hey this is a pretty decent idea. It makes sense too. Usually, when I see posts about  cool new ideas that should be implemented into the game they usually fall into the category of too extreme/ unbalanced/ gimmicky/ complex. This doesn't fall into that category. Not only would it be a mode unique to Titanfall (like you mentioned), it encourages some good 'ol fashioned teamwork. What's funny though is that I think a similar mode (where the main feature is a single titan on each team) has already been hinted at in the past (Look through past posts, I remember something about descriptions/titles for unreleased modes being found in the game files). However, where the typical idea would be to throw a titan at two individuals at a time, this is unique in that it isn't a titan variant of marked for death. A skilled pilot can be very effective against a couple of other pilots when inside of a titan, so it would be like giving players a chance to play God in a sense/ power trips for everyone! I can already see that this will promote a sort of tug-of-war style of gameplay. One team gets their titan early, bashes in the other team. The other team whittles away at the opposing team's titan until they call in their own and subsequently annihilate it. Now the other team is in power and gets to take the enemy team for a spin. Repeat ad infinitum. The more and more I think about it the more and more there is to talk about it. As people become more familiar with the mode, battles will become strongly centered around friendly titans (MOBILE fighting hotspots anyone? - will also allow players to explore the less visible areas of the map as titans scavenge for scarce grunt targets). Pilots will have the advantage against enemy pilots when around their team's titan, so they'll move with the titan (That, and if you stray from your titan and get picked off, you just help the enemy team decrease their timer / Also, you will want your titan to be on the move, as that will net your team more kills, but by being on the move you put your titan at risk by giving enemy pilots a chance to catch your titan off guard so you'll need to be around it). It'll be up to the team's titan to cover as much ground as possible while in the titan to help acquire more and more grunt kills/pilot kills, the like. You also don't want your titan to go down, not only will you lose your advantage over the enemy team when your titan goes down, but the enemy team can decrease their timer significantly if they score enough hits on your titan.

The only thing that really needs to be addressed here is that, although titans can be very effective they aren't too effective against multiple enemy pilots. Going up against 2-3? As one pelts your from afar with a hard hitting archer, you try to knock out the pilots competing for a rodeo. Even if you kill one, say by using electric smoke to neutralize the one on your back, now you have to go on the run because allowing another one to mount you will be the end of it. I don't think this should be remedied with a direct buff, but perhaps an objective inside the game to compete for? Something that will  perpetually cause pilots to engage with the enemy titan and pilots. An objective where the brute force of a titan can come into play, and perhaps force enemy pilots to stick in one place. Having to face off against a titan for a control point doesn't seem interesting to me though. My mind started to wander towards grunts, but unless they're concentrated in a small area and their accuracy is buffed, pilots are no less effective against them than titans. If Respawn ever got around to this idea, I think they would have to create a new, dynamic sort of objective (But then again, you want to try to remain simple if you want this idea to get picked up. Try to rely solely on simple adjustments to get the most out of the already existing mechanics of the game). Perhaps something like ""headquarters"" or whatever it was called in Call of Duty (If they still even have that around, I never really played headquarters and this was back when Modern Warfare 2 was out I believe). Have an objective that changes position everyone couple of minutes and there is breaks where the objective isn't even live/present in between position changes. (Objective is up and there are two titans? well then you will get an awesome confrontation. Hopefully your team did good enough to get that core charge, eh? / Now the objective is over, back to scrounging for points/grunt kills around the map)  And to capitalize on titan power, have it so that being in control of the point causes enemy grunts to rally towards the point, rather than it be a ""control objective -&gt; get points -&gt; win game"" sort of deal (Maybe have both team's grunts mass towards the point, which would also make more sense realism wise. This will also decrease the chance that one team will just plain out dominate the objective, as these grunt kills can be used as a power boost - grunts=points= less build time or core charge. This would make for a slippery slope. By having a titan at your disposal, you will be able to get more out of the time the objective is live than your opponents though.). This will force the enemy titan to move around the area if he wants those points and allow everyone, including enemy pilots, a chance at a fair battle because one team isn't given the home field advantage (titan&gt;pilots in confined spaces) - everyone retains the ability to make use of their parkour maneuvers. 

Again, yes a team with a titan will probably get more points because they have a titan sized arsenal at their disposal, but  by putting the titan on the move there is that risk/reward you have to take into account.

Another note, what exactly is the goal here? Like, is it simply ""have the only titan on the battlefield and wreak havoc on the enemy team for a bit""? Maybe it goes a bit further, because you don't want it to just stop at that. It also begins to look even MORE like a form of attrition than it already does. So, what else is there? Core charges are something you can shoot for, but what interest do your friendly pilots have in giving you a core charge? Sure, it's nice to have but does it really provide that much of a leg up on the opponent than does having a simple titan? By creating an objective you encourage confrontation, and if the other team has a titan then you will REALLY want that charge because then you have a greater chance of winning that objective from them. Maybe the concept of the game could be a *calm*-ACTION-*calm*-ACTION-*calm* sort of thing where your points play a game of tug-of-war with the enemy. Sure you're a good ways ahead of the other team while the objective is gone, but holding that objective is definitely game changing. This also allows for a ""anybody's game"" type of thing in public lobbies and a strong competitive environment when teams are clan based. This is because every second you put into the game has a strong effect towards the end result. Let your titan get lit up? Well when the time comes for a titan v titan confrontation your team is going to lose. Now lets see how well the enemy team can smash you until it comes time for your team to call down a titan. No grunts around your titan? Maybe you'll stray a bit from the team and collect a few that you see over there. Woops, you wandered into enemy pilot territory (enemy pilots will probably be a bit less concentrated if they don't have a titan) and you got ambushed. Now the enemy team is that much closer to calling down a titan/ getting their charge first. There are a lot of decisions to make here which may make the mode seem a bit noob unfriendly, but the fact that Titans and objectives (which you can identify as these strong advantages when in control of them or disadvantages when you don't) are only temporary means that only one team will be in the lead for so long. It becomes a contest of who can wear their power the best when they have it, instead of the typical which team is stronger and how well can they translate their talent into the game. And the fact that EVERYONE gets the chance to be the top gun is something really exciting and unique.

I'm going to stop here, I see I already have went a bit overboard. I think this is a really great idea giligan. I hope, at the least, Respawn puts in something similar. I think this type of mode would compliment the gameplay Titanfall triumphs really well. If I get the time, I might edit this comment to make it a bit neater/comprehensive/understandable.

The first thing to consider when putting together a team is the synergy they have. Synergy is a tricky concept to get down, because not only must you have synergy between your team members, you must also have synergy with your opponents' pokemon, and since they are ever changing with each battle, you will have to start noticing patterns. Such as pokemon you find yourself facing often, the items particular pokemon seem to always have, the move sets they have, as well as how trainers tend to use them in battle. These patterns collectively are known as the meta game.
For example: in a Recent battle I started off with forretress and my opponent's lead was Noivern. I had read recently that a common setup for Noivern was a special attack build with fire blast or flame thrower as one of his attacks. Predicting a fire move (since forretress is only weak to fire, and his bug steel typing makes him 4x weak to it) I switched out into my chandelure that had the ability flash fire. The Noivern did in fact use flamethrower and chandelure just absorbed the attacked and got a damage boost because of it.
My team in the above situation displayed good synergy as I had a way to completely negate one of my pokemon's weakness.
Synergy is something to always consider, but don't stress over it. As you battle more, it will come naturally.

With Bastet I have no trouble with the orbs I was getting all colors were fair game.

But considering that a 4-light match in a five total combo (A normal hit, no orb changers) + 9x + 1.5x Heracles boosted runs 150k damage for my un leveled Athena.  I think you cad easily output enough damage.

Heck if your planning to stall for Heracles, might as well consider running a Zeus in there as well.  His stats are amazing and that 35% gravity is very savvy.

I feel like Ronia is a little overblown, she is too reliant on active skills to output large amounts of damage.  Sure you can get lucky and get your red/dark row to make in the first move, but without rows her 6.25x damage really isn't much at all especially when it comes to the first round of some mythical descends.  Don't get me wrong she is an amazing lead, but one team is very unlikely to take you through all the content in the game.

0,4Δ,t1_cjjlx0j,1,1407428573,,t3_2csilo,False,changemyview,False,,t5_2w2s8,"I think you're missing the financial benefit of sports. People LOVE sports and have shown that they're willing to travel &amp; pay good money to watch the games.

For instance, whenever there's a game at one of our stadiums:

1) Supporters of the non-home team will travel to our city, purchasing gas and hotel accommodations. This money directly benefits those businesses, as well as everyone from the taxes they collect (and hotels typically have  a higher tax rate). Taxes pay for stuff for everyone (schools, roads, emergency services, etc.) Everyone benefits.

2) The businesses near the hotels and the ones near the stadium will have more customers. My brother-in-law manages a nice restaurant near one of our stadiums--anytime there's a game (any type of game) they get a TON of business. This helps all those businesses (as well as everyone again from the taxes collected). Everyone benefits from this.

3) The stadiums employ a ton of people to deal with the large crowds, from parking, janitorial, usher, concessions, item selling, ticket sellers, various specialists to deal with all the different type of electronics (computers, sound, etc.), marketing &amp; organizers, legal, admin assistants, finances, etc.  More jobs= better for everyone.

This is why cities fight over who gets the superbowl or olympics-- they can be a HUGE boost to the economy. It's also why schools have sports--it's a great (if not the best) way to bring revenue to the school.

So sports are NOT a waste of societies resources because, outside of the obvious fact that it brings entertainment to the viewers, it boosts our economy--which helps everyone.

This is going to piss drivers off and it would have worked much better if the streetcar had been put on Walnut from City Market to Union Station, but we can't undo the mistakes that were already made by the amateurs who planned this without citywide feedback. The only way to make this rail investment worth it is to get cars out of the way.

2) Hire a consultant like Jarrett Walker  to come in, analyze KCATA, see if he can figure out a way to reconnect people to jobs and entertainment within their communities as opposed to the current system which more or less requires a transfer downtown to get anywhere.

Everything after this would be subject to change after J.W.'s analysis.

3) Build a true BRT route on the east lanes of Paseo Blvd. Using the existing infrastructure, this should not cost much more than the proposed Prospect MAX; around $50M. Additionally, create buffered bike lanes on the west side of Paseo. This would connect Cliff Drive bike trail to the Trolley Track Trail with safe bicycle lanes and dedicated express bus transit. It would defy the Troost boundary, restore one of the most beautiful Boulevards in our city, and potentially receive national attention for 9 miles of automobile free parks through the center of our city. It could be utilized for pedestrians, bicycles, dog parks, playgrounds, fountains, etc, and it would hopefully boost development at 18th &amp;amp; Vine, the castle that is being restored, the old Disney Laugh-O-Gram studio, etc.

 *Maybe* leave the far west lane(s) open for cars to accommodate the residents on Paseo if no other options are viable. Most automobile traffic should be diverted to Hwy 71 or Troost.

4) Consider upgrading every proposed streetcar line to a MAX bus. This includes 12th St, 18th St, SW Blvd, etc. Also consider 63rd St and either 85th St or Bannister. (I say 85th because that's the South end of Paseo Blvd.)

5) Create a mobile app that goes beyond Google Maps. It could track buses with GPS so you know if they're running late. It could hail a cab, lyft, or uber if you missed your bus, or need a ride to the closest bus stop. But additionally, it could function as a social media tool like FourSquare and Reddit, allowing you to check in, leave notes or photos for people, public or only viewable by others in your network, up vote and down vote, etc. You could collect points for checking in at different locations and earn rewards like free fare or coupons for businesses that sponsored it, etc.

6) Design between eight and twelve transit depots that incorporate interesting architecture or sculptural design. I dont just mean an artistic bus shelter, but an actual piece of art; maybe interactive like swings that light up or piano keys in the ground. Make the actual stop THE destination. People will ride the bus just to visit the various structures for recreation. Hopefully it will familiarize them with the bus network and convince them to map out their work commutes, etc.

7) If all of this is done successfully and at a reasonable cost, figure out how to do it in the Northland. Obviously some of the stuff would be expensive and might have to find public art grants or tech startup grants, etc. But the basic bus network could work for a fraction of the cost of rail and be just as/more successful for a fraction of the cost.

&gt;There have been wars all over the world since the dawn of man, but whites were among the few who had the technological prowess to make their wars large enough to notice. If African tribes had the technology of Europeans they would have even more war and for much more stupid reasons.

Pure speculation and bias. 

&gt;Also, wars don't really represent the common person's behavior. WW2 isn't analogous to anyone's neighborhood, and what goes on in your neighborhood is what actually affects the quality of life for the overwhelmingly vast majority of people.

What a cop-out. The atrocities of war are committed by and large trough the actions of the average soldiery and with the tacit approval of the general population. 

The ""neighborhood"" comment is probably referring to some racist caricature of the violence in places like Detroit and Chicago. Guess what? These places have become war zones as well. The vast majority of the killing occurs by and between rival drug organizations vying for power in the vacuum created by decades of government sanctioned segregation.

&gt;the Germans felt that the Jews were a threat to their society which is why they detained them all. Apparently many other countries agreed because nobody volunteered to take them.

Taking in a population of millions of refugees is difficult regardless of how they are viewed. Clearly, anti-Jewish sentiment was much stronger in the 1940s, but equating reluctance to harbor refugees with a campaign of extermination is disingenuous hyperbole.  

&gt;What about it? Slavery existed all over the world at that point. And white countries hardly took any slaves compared to other countries.

One of my personal favorites. ""White countries""? What color do you think the people who were shipping, buying, and owning slaves in Brazil and the Caribbean were? What color are most of the elite in these same places today?

&gt;And not only that, but it's whites that did much of the work to end the global slave trade. It was the British who enforced the ban on slavery in the Atlantic.

They ended what they started, excellent.

&gt;Secondly, wars for conquest of land was constantly going on all over the world at that point in history. Even the Native Americans fought each other for land.

In places like North America, (your ""white countries"") war between Native groups was greatly exacerbated by the encroachment and economic disruption of European settlers. We honestly don't know very much about what was going on beforehand.

&gt;""White man's burden"" ... For example, the burden of having to babysit black Americans by spending our money to give them welfare, to police their neighborhoods, to provide them with roads and other infrastructure, and so on.

""Our"" money? Last time I checked, black Americans are citizens and thus belong within the collective ""we"" implied by ""general welfare"" and all that. It's ironic that an avowed racist would lament that fact that centuries of slavery followed by decades of economic, educational, and housing segregation have lead to costly infrastructural issues in black communities, when much of this could have been avoided early on through rational policy unclouded by the emotional baggage of racism. 

&gt;They were ""doing really well"" but still far behind Europeans by that point in history, technologically. They were also brutally violent with their customs of ritual sacrifice.

Ritual sacrifice, like European war, was governed by the elites and thus wasn't something happening in the ""neighborhood"" of everyday life. According to you, this is inadmissible evidence of race-wide violent tendency. 

&gt;I haven't said a single thing about myself or how I'm better than anyone. I come to these conclusions by observing the world and making a judgement about those observations

""I was born in a world in which recent history has granted white people a privileged position in the global economy and politics. Rather than being curious about the historical/structural/environmental reasons for this contingent privilege, I instead seek to naturalize my position through appeals to the immutable aspects of race.""

&gt;We could have a peaceful and productive society but we are dragged down by the presence of inferior races.

&gt;These inferior races have a non-viable spectrum of people in them. By that I mean, they have too many bad people (criminals) and not enough good people (incorruptible and tireless people willing to punish crime) to be viable. Too many lazy people and not enough industrious people. Too many stupid people and not enough smart people. Too many callous and uncaring people and not enough warm and friendly people.

Translation: Due to centuries of slavery, exploitation, discrimination, and segregation, black people have higher rates of poverty and much less accumulated wealth and education in their families. This, combined with a much higher likelihood of living in densely populated urban environments means that black people are more likely than white people to be unemployed, uneducated, desperate, depressed, victimized, incarcerated, etc.

[Note: ""Africa"" itself is not the pristine control group in this social experiment. There was this thing called colonialism (and imperialism) that happened there for many centuries. Colonialism is bad; so bad that our nations' heroes fought a war to forestall some of its less savory aspects. Unchecked colonialism, combined with racist ideology and willful ignorance of local culture politics has done incalculable damage in large portions of Africa.]

&gt;As a simple example, if you have a lot of people who are willing and able to punish crime and not very many people who are willing and able to commit crimes, then you don't need to dedicate much of your society's time and energy towards dealing with crime. This frees people up to work on other more important and interesting things. We don't need to dedicate our most intelligent and hardworking people to keep crime in check, so they can work on something else which boosts our quality of life.

It's laughable to think that you believe that our nation's best and brightest are toiling away at the ""crime"" problem while other industries are neglected. Far, far from it. First, the smartest people are busy making money and not worrying about whether some gangbanger shooting another gangbanger is getting rehabilitated or thrown into a crate for 30 years. Wealthy, educated people don't have to worry about urban inner city crime except as an abstraction or a political talking-point. Second, the criminal justice system is itself a lucrative industry. These good people who are so ""willing"" to punish crime are often quite enthusiastic about finding new blood to enter the system and fill our alarming number of prisons (many of which are becoming privatized). 

&gt;The propensity to commit crime stems from a lot of factors which are biological and thus genetic. Being of low intelligence means that you make poor decisions, such as focusing on graduating from school. It also means you'll do worse in school. It also means that some subjects are simply out of reach for you intellectually (the highest fields of law, engineering, medicine, science). It means that you will be unaware of viable options that are available to you. 

Yes, poor kids who have no role models, no job prospects, and peer groups who are pressuring them to sell drugs or get pregnant are in trouble because of their immutable, dumb African genes and not due to the colossal structural barriers of their social environment. Great analysis. ""Sorry, kid, you never learned to read past 5th grade level since your teachers all sucked and your high school was miserably overcrowded and dangerous. The real reason you won't become a doctor or lawyer is your genes! Ignore all the children of African immigrants graduating college in record numbers and becoming successful professionals in all fields...""

 &gt;There is also the matter of temperament. Strong emotional reactions to things is the result of brain chemistry. If you have a violent reaction to even the smallest of slights then you will create conflict where none needs to exist. Doesn't this sound familiar with regards to the black community? Fighting over nothing? 

Nope, not familiar to me. Sounds like something a racist would believe. If you think gang soldiers shooting each other in the streets in territorial disputes constitutes ""fighting over nothing"" I want to see your explanation for the rationality of World War I. 

&gt;Ultimately you're oging to have to come with something stronger than ""BUT WHAT ABOUT WW2 AND THE INDIANS"". I have been doing this for a lot longer than you and I've encountered much better arguments. You should view this as a chance to learn something, not a chance to prove something, because you will not.

It's really the arrogance and not the racism that gets to me the most.

It's conceivable that cutting hours can produce productivity if employees are ""overworking."" This means employers in turn can pay their workers more to work less. This effect translates to a macro scale without any problems: productivity boosts for all companies, and eventually wages increase for all employees. This is consistent. The only way this doesn't work going from a micro to macro scale is if companies collectively increase productivity while reducing total payments to labor--but unless you believe laborers have almost no bargaining power, this is unlikely. And if laborers really do have that little bargaining power, I don't think having an economic system that encourages overworking is the best way to transfer money to laborers.....

Last but not least, let's suppose the average laborer isn't overworking, and working less actually does reduce GDP. Well, GDP isn't the end all be all of human welfare.

I played some of my placement games too late at night, didn't play well, and got a bit demoralised. I was ready for placements because I've always played with my friends leveling up, they ranged from mid gold to diamond, so I was used to a fairly decent standard of play. I also played to get a decent rank, rather than to improve, so I put too much pressure on myself. Especially early on, always play to improve, that way, you can take something from a loss rather than just get frustrated. 

Ranked games can be fairly toxic. If you want to do well and enjoy yourself, dont be that idiot that goes 'this x' or say its game over after first blood. Basically, take no notice of ragers. They are the one with the problem, dont rage back, just mute you can follow pings. Also, never give up a game. If you play for objectives and don't get yourself caught out, low elo teams will throw you a game quite often, and sometimes reminding your team they could throw gives a moral boost.

Have at least 2 standard rune pages. As a confident adc player, in my placements I often initiated early trades to figure out if my opponents had defensive runes. Sometimes they didn't, which is really dumb, because if I noticed I could just trade with them, and win them all, pushing them out of lane and taking huge cs leads and sometimes kills. This applies to you supporting massively. A confident support in low elo can carry the shit out of games. If you are thresh for example, and you tell your adc to push for lv 2 and then initiate a trade/2v2, you can win a bot lane for any slightly competent adc. Also, as support, vision and tactics will win you games if you know how. 

You have to prepare mentally a bit. Most of the players I see in solo q are not strong mentally. Ranked climbing is a long haul thing unless you are some diamond player ranking up a new account. One thing I read that I think is true was that about 40% of games you'll win without too much influence,  40% you will probably lose no matter what, and the remaining 20 are gonna be upto you, and thats how you climb. Losing streaks can put you in a crap mood so try to play a normal with friends or do somethimg to chill out afterwards. 

Supporting in low elo is going to be possibly frustrating. Maybe its because I love to play adc, but if I have to support and the adc doesnt farm well or follow up on anything despite pings and communication then I can feel a bit useless. Bot lane is probably the only role where its really helpful to duo imo. Find a reliable adc who you dont mind playing a few hours with and you will prpbably have a better time.

Finally, have a champion or some champions, that are basically free elo for you. I mean, champs that you play a lot or 'main' and end up with a really high win rate on. For me its syndra mid lane, I have around 63% win rate over 80 or so games and graves, lucian, caitlyn 60% win rate over about 150 games collectively. You can afford to have a 50% ratio on loads of champs if you have a few your unstoppable on.

Anyway, ive managed to go from silver 5 to hovering between gold 1 and 2 in my first season, but needed a lot of tips and help from friends, if you stay calm you'll do fine, good luck and have fun

&gt; Getting power cord up is waaaaaay harder now and power chords were what Sona's kit revolved around imo

Unless you wanna poke the enemy, power chord is usually a threat you keep stacked for a fight. They miscalculated and took a tower hit? Shoot a slow and burst them to death with your Q and AAs. They think they can take you? Damage reduction onto their carry! They wanna dive while low health? Staccato + Q to lower that health bar more and collect the kill with the turret.

Getting three stacks is easy when you do have three spells. Of course, you won't be spamming power chords 24/7 like you could before.

&gt; I feel like that is suicidal now, you must be passive now because your spells will be on cooldown more often, have shorter range, and do less. 

Poke or sustain champions are always in danger when they want to attack, that's the point of it: high risk, high reward. You will find also that the movement speed boost is really a plus on this side, allowing to make surprise attacks.

&gt; It is pretty pointless to build a Tear on her now too because of the differing and super long cooldowns. 

I agree on this with you, but why would you even build the tear of goddess on Sona before her rework? Apart from the AP it gives, it is a self-centered object. There are tons of other items that gives mana regeneration, the first of them being chalice-based items. 

&gt; The best way to land ultimate is still to flash ult, regardless of what rito says. 

You can now E &gt; R as well. Or even E &gt; Talisman &gt; R if you want.

&gt; I used to be very aggressive with sona and play a heavy poke style with her. 

I think this is part of why she was reworked. Sona fits better in the sustain champion category. She never was a Karma, or a Lulu in term of poke efficiency. The rework has strengthen her main value, without removing to much of its poke power. As I already said, with good synergy, it might even be better.

&gt; The new Sona is much better, and actually more durable as the game goes on. 

I totally goes with WhatIsWard on this point. The speed boost allow you to be very mobile and avoid being caught if you know what you're doing. It's not unusual to died only a few time with her now.

&gt; In a game dominated by tanky supports, nerfing a squishy one's early game survivability while also increasing their cooldowns come across as unfair to me. It forces passive play, not aggressive play as they say they were trying to do. One bad engagement and it is a double kill for enemy bot lane and a steamroll fest you can never recover from. Solo queue ADCs go on tilt very easily. 

Like I said, Sona is more of a sustain champion than a poke champion. Sustain is meant to counter poke lanes, not kill/tanky lanes like Leona or Thresh. These one won't let you time to even cast your heal.

&gt; When I read higher decision making, what really see is more passive play, waiting for the opportunity to respond and do something instead of actually being aggressive and making plays happen. Do you disagree? How so? 

You are contradicting yourself there. Higher decision making = find the good opportunity. There are two way to have opportunities: wait for them (passive) or make opportunities (active). A good part of this does not even rely on your kit, but rather on your positioning, your ability to get free poke. 

&gt; Where as before I would be able to poke and heal and feel like my spells were doing something, now I have to wait until my ADC gets in the right position with the enemies in the right position that I can risk moving in to try and tag them with an aura and maybe get a Q off too and then back off til my cooldowns come back up. That comes across as much more passive play, not active. 

Yeah, Sona is more dependant on her teamate than she used to be, I'll grant you that. People are not used to the new Sona yet, but good ADC will be able to take advantage of this new playstyle. 

&gt; Active play means you are making informed intelligent decisions, not just going in and slamming them with spells and autos. Passive play would be just sitting around with your auras on and letting your carry attempt to farm, while healing him every now and again. 

With a kill lane, the best thing you can do is to provide enough room for your ADC to farm correctly. If he can stay at the same CS level, it's a won lane. Kill are not what you are looking for with a sustain bot-lane. On the other hand, they will be in trouble if they can't capitalise on their attacks to get kills or deny farm.

&gt; so you don't build frost queens? you build a relic shield on sona? Frost Queens is the #1 item Sona players take. Why you would take Relic Shield is beyond me. On thresh or braum or leona, sure. Does not belong on Sona. Maybe that is the thing now. If so, I think it is in the wrong direction for how Sona should be and what would help make her more active. 

Wooo-woo. You've misread him there. He said Sona brings sustain that Braum or Leona don't have unless **they** (Braum &amp; Leona) buy a Relic Shield. He obviously don't build Sona with relic shield, that would be silly. 

&gt; Well if thats the case, Riot failed in doing what they said they wanted to do, make her more active. This promoted more passive play. Sit back and wait for narrower field of opportunity to do something useful arises. That sounds like a boring champion to play. Sitting around waiting to go OO Ooo I can rush in for a single Q poke with my ADC while buffing them with my aura if I dont get tangled in the minions and if things go right I might get close enough to drop my nerfed power cord too. And if things go south my faster E spell will definitely have me moving faster and if Im lucky enough to be near enough to the ADC, maybe them too, but dont count on that clutch E power cord because my higher cooldowns probably mean I dont have 3 stacks at the right moment to get it off in time! UGGGGH so frustrating!

You see the things in black here. Sona is not an all-in champion, going for the kill. Instead, she helps her carry to gain through small but repeated victorious trades. Keep track of both ADC last hitting pattern and timing, go in for poke when the enemy carry come in front to make a CS. You're not Leona, rushing in a CC-ing everybody to death.

&gt; What I am saying that old Sona had more opportunity for thoughtful aggression at early levels and this Sona has had that taken away. 

On the contrary, being able to deal more damage with one spell + AA than before, she can definitely take advantage of small opportunities. But yes, it takes more attention to notice them and you are definitely hindered if you miss them and go in without thinking. Think that your poke is a hit and run, and you just need .5sec to hit them.

&gt; You MUST play passively until you higher cooldown spells make more of an impact and you are in less danger of getting 100-0'd by a CC tank and ADC tearing into you for first blood. No need to outplay ourselves indeed. In fact new sona's best bet is to stay near the tower until level 6. 

I strongly disagree with this. Getting poke on enemy tank while the carry is occupied is good for your lane. The more damage the better. And if that supports goes in but ADC is not following, you and your mate will ruin her. Of course, it's your job to create the opportunities, make that Thresh miss a hook, or that Leona fail her Zenith blade. Then you're free to go, hit them hard and go back. 
Keep in mind that Sona is not the champion that will punish mistakes by death. These champions are Leona, Thresh, Morgana... not Sona.",1,mvyonline,True,t3_2crv3z,0,cjimzwb,0,1435103349,

1. Immediately hold a grand tournament. If you need the prestige, create a duchy somewhere and give it away, or get married/arrange a marriage for your heir (your new heir, not the one that just inherited) and don't collect the marriage tax. You will also have more prestige if you had a council job or were landed during the previous king's reign.

2. Hold a feast shortly after the tournament.

3. Go on a pilgrimage - it gives you a small boost with every character of the same religion.

4. Release some prisoners - it helps if there were some left over from the previous king.

5. Give out honorary titles to the most powerful vassals, bribe a couple of the less powerful ones. If you have extra daughters, send them to your dukes for education. All of these methods are only helpful for vassals with a neutral or mildly negative opinion of you. Going from -5 to +5 or from +5 to +15 is fairly significant in RoI. Going from -100 to -90 makes no difference.

6. If there is a particular vassal who looks likely to rebel no matter what you do - say, a duke with opinion -100 - try to get him early. Often your spymaster will catch him in some other plot, and you can have cause to imprison him before he has time to advance any one faction. Even if he rebels when you try to arrest him, you only have to deal with him and his vassals rather than with a whole faction.

7. Send your chancellor to one of your ""borderline"" vassals (like 0 opinion, not -100). The relations boost will often be enough to make them stay out of factions.

Generally, I found that factions became easier to deal with in RoI. They now need more support before they fire, and people will be more likely to leave them if they have a good opinion of you (like over 30).",2,theworldtheworld,True,t3_2crzur,0,cjijqmi,0,1435101414,

 I am on OKCupid as well. I first heard about Tinder from a friend who just made reference to it in conversation, with pretty much no context. She is one of the MANY women I know who hates having her pic taken and said to me ""Ashley keeps telling to use Tinder cause its picture based; like I *thats* what I want"" so I didn't know anything about it when I got it.

I downloaded it, saw the platform, thought it was fun, did get an ego boost from matching with like 8/10 with the guys I ""liked"" (now I know all guys swipe right on everyone, lol). But yeah, it seemed fishy. So I started googling ""is tinder a hookup ap"" and read a bunch of articles that essentially said ""men want it to be but women don't see it that way""--gender bias not withstanding, I basically took that to mean, ppl are still figuring that out.  That google included forum posts that seemed to indicate it for all sorts of reasons, so I kept up with it.  Like I said I met two guys from it. Those were the two people I met on dating sites I actually dated. I didn't end up dating anyone from OKC (I met with about 9 ppl from OKC and Tinder combined. Didn't click with anyone but the two tinder guys).

So, when I moved, I joined it and OKC. And frankly, I like it. I like that its location based. I like its chat platform so I can get into conversations quickly (I like to just meet ppl in person to see if there's chemistry; not get into long conversations; keeping up with OKC correspondence can be like writing the great American novel). And I'm not mad at the dudes who just wanna hook up (shit, I like dick pics, I'm not gonna go out with anyone who sends them probably, but I like dicks so why not collect the pics, lol) Just a little disappointed cause I had good luck with it before.

Conveniently he landed in the gardens outside of Starfleet HQ and is immediately accosted by an agent of the Department of Temporal Investigations who is on his way to a meeting to discuss the massive temporal disturbances related to the universes colliding. Using his psychic paper he gets escorted to the meeting and learns that some fierce pseudo-species called the Borg have recently gone through a radical change in strategy, tactics, aggressiveness, abilities, and appearance, their drab dark-grey mesh suits replaced with a new ablative/dispersive silver colored alloy.

So you submit a link that's not on the domain that's dominating the subreddit and look at it. Obviously it takes a little while for several people to see a post unless several people are furiously F5ing /new. So if you watch the vote count immediately after submitting and it **immediately* drops to -4 then you know something fishy is going on.

So then you submit a link using the domain that's not getting downvoted and do the same thing. Immediately hits +4 before anyone has even had time to see it.

From that you can safely start to assume that the same four accounts are set up on a bot to immediately upvote comments from one domain and downvote comments from any other since the up/down votes are a consistent, immediate number on every submission. When you've collected enough information you hand it over to the admins or just post it and let the pitchforks fly.

So unless your goal is to restore Catholicism ti might be worth it to switch.  You can check the MA of all the religions in the ledge tab and try to switch to a high one.  If you want to try to restore Catholicism, the easiest way will be to make sure there are not currently anti-popes.  If there are depose them.  Then go after Holy Sites, which are most likely owned by those filthy Cathar and therefore Holy War-able if you are close to them.

2.  So you can only hold two duchies before vassals get angry for just having too many duchies.  You will also see vassals with a ""Desires Duchy of X"" for Duchies you control, where your Capital seat isn't.  

Destroying versus distributing is up to you.  I like High Level vassals.  So if I am king I make dukes.  Emperor I make kings.  I think it makes managing easier, and can also be challenging since some of your vassals can get large enough that you HAVE to worry about keeping them happy.

3.  If they hold only only one landed title (County) then take that county from them and the dukedom will be dissolved as well.  If they hold more than one County I would say revoke the Duchy, this will get rid of any vassals they may have had (that were counts).  If they personally had all of their territory as their demesne, then take a county at a time.  There is no way to revoke more than one property (for free, no opinion penalties) unless they rebel again.  

4.  This is because of who you are giving the land to.  The inheritance warning is because their line of inheritance means the land might pass out of their realm (Their Son who is first in line, may already by a vassal of someone else).  So when handing out titles, don't just check out the person, check out their family.  You want to know what kind of crazy you are getting yourself into, especially since even if their son will remain your vassal, they will eventually be your vassal and you want to make sure he has not or has, if that's your preference, murdered his father, and 11 brothers.

5.  Use the Create new vassal for all cities, churches, and lower baronies (Unless you are trying to do something special).  The county level title you can't do this for.  I always use the create new vassal, as it just isn't worth it to sift through multiple people for the cities and churches.  The lower baronies I usually leave blank, and when I grant the County I click the ""Include Lower Titles"" which leaves that person then with the county and the barony for a little boost for them.

6.  I don't know sorry.  I always just scheme in my home county since I want to catch people plotting against me, and rarely use it for the faction aspect of scheme.  I usually scheme for regencies or anticipated bad inheritances.  Otherwise I have them doing the technology one.

7.  Chancellor is good for fabricating claims.  But his improve relations is his real highlight.  Single county claims are good, duchy claims are good but too rare.  As a king you should be trying to expand by pressing other peoples (after making them your vassal) claims, this way you can get chunks of land.  Trying to take over the world one county at a time is tedious.  Improve relations with your strongest vassal, or your strongest ally.  Marshall, I would agree that early game he stays on troops.  If you have Legacy of Rome, as soon as you have 1 or 2 retinues, you can start to move him off to tech, as the retinues can replace that lost levy (Considering he can only boost 1 county).    Spymaster I already talked about.  Steward I always use collect taxes, early to end game.  Chaplain is a wasted councilor spot.  If you have Sons of Abraham then using him on the pope is great for free money.  Otherwise I like to send them to the great pagan lands (look for cynical rulers) to try to convert.  The councilor will boost the spread to the county they are stationed.  So putting them in your capital is usually not the best choice since it has the highest tech.

8.  Its not fluctuating its gradually increasing.  You may be moving around the map, in which case you are seeing each counties individual tech levels (tech is by county).  But technology won't decrease, and it will creep up on its own (tech spread). 

9.  Primo keeps your lands together, but has some opinion malus.  A lot of the community likes Elective, and it is awesome because it lets you pick the best, but can be hard to get away with sweeping tyrannical actions because then people won't vote for your chosen heir.  In your situation, with your territories and vassals possibly of different religions this might be a bad choice.  I had a blast playing Ultimo (youngest) because as long as you got through regency, it usually meant extremely long reigns.  Gavelkind is a challenge, and requires some manipulation of lands and lives every so often.  Seniority will consolidate lands in your dynasty.  So if you have been handing out titles to family.  If you switch to Seniority, eventually everything will come back.  But really you should go Cathar, enable absolute Cognatic (Male and Female inherit equally) and spread equality through Gavelkind :-D.

10.  Create a republic (give a coastal city holder the county title, then give them a duchy title).  Put your city taxes on harsh.  I like to tax my feudal vassals as well (small).  Religion (small) as well.  Cities generate a ton of money so you can build those in your empty holding spots.  Somebody has done calculations on stuff like this like Build City wall then build blah blah blah.  Essentially it boils down to that certain buildings can't normally pay for themselves.  Just keep warring.  Sieges are great money makers, especially when you can capture some profitable women and children.  Only really build things when you have a surplus of money.  I like to keep at least 400'ish in reserve and usually its more like 1000, so that if I have to defend I can easily hire and not have to worry about paying mercenaries or if the opportunity for a large chunk of land comes, the mercenaries like to attack as much as defend.

Why?  Because valve doesn't give a fuck.  I've been playing comp consecutively for a year and that's the truth.  I've been making excuses for them over the last year defending them saying it's super hard to be a step ahead of the cheaters, it's not easy to control yada yada.  Truth is they're not doing shit to control it.

Someone posted stats about the money they make in a weeks time JUST from market purchases.  It was in the millions of dollars, in one week, and that's only skins if I remember correctly.  It didn't account for keys, cases, operation passes, or the hackers buying endless accounts for $3.50.  

It's been the same thing every time.  Game gets infested with hackers, valve waits a few months and ""collects"" all the hacker data, then bans them all and keeps the money they made off their skins.  Then those same stupid ass holes go and buy more accounts for $3, and make ten times that in skins and money by boosting kids.

Valve is making a killing, the cheaters and boosters are making a killing, and the players continue to pay the price, the only
Ones who actually give a shit about the game.

It's been two years and overwatch is still in beta.  It's been two years and the game still has major bugs, issues, and glitches which are game breaking.  Yet they continue to throw in more shit skins, leave the real problems on the loose, and leave hackers to rule the game.

By this time there are no more excuses, unless people are posting weekly threads with 400 comments bitching and complaining about cheaters, game breaking bugs etc, valve turns away.  There's no excuse why this game should still be this broken after this long while they focus all of their updates primarily on making money.

Fuck em.  Whoever is in charge of CSGO at valve should be shit on.  But you know that'll never happen, because the guy is a financial Genius and earned more money from this game alone than they could have ever dreamed of.  So it'll keep happening, and it won't stop, ever.

That's about what you're looking at.  

The cheaters have been on a steady decline this week thanks to the community and overwatchers who take their time to invest in fighting the cheaters.  Soon hopefully they'll be non existent, until a month from now when the next wave comes in and it's broken for another 2-3 months.

A species whose technology enables them to manipulate the timeline is both a distinct advantage (tactically and practically) and a unique method of employing technology the Borg have most certainly encountered but ignored (i.e. chroniton torpedoes). 

The Borg's entire purpose is to assimilate unique, advanced and distinct cultures into their own in order to bring them one step closer to perfection. Assuming there is an algorithm or protocol within the Collective which prioritizes certain species (as in, why the Kazon were left unmolested), it would be foolish to allow such a small and comparatively weak species such as the Krenim to remain un-assimilated. 

The technology for the use of shield-penetrating torpedoes alone would represent a boost in Borg offensive capabilities - perhaps even enough to tip the Undine/8472 war in their favour. And, in this scenario, the Borg would have a further advantage in that they can re-write and erase lost battles in an instant, thereby erasing any errors or imperfect decisions committed or made during an engagement: bringing them one step closer to perfection and one step closer to assimilating an indomitable species.

Where I start to disagree is with your unit choice. Bane Thralls without Tartarus to increase threat range is rubbish. The mechanithralls are decent but I find them much more useful when you have living troops of your own to collect corpses from.

You also can't make use of Black Spot that well. Troops without reach are much less likely to get a free second attack. With Cryx that's Bane Knights and Satyxis Raiders. Bane Knights I've found are very useful as Death Ward allows them to survive the POW 10 attacks very well.

Having that no knockdown aura from the captain takes a lot of assassinations off the table as Skarre depends on her defence rather than her armour, especially her epic version.

I'm going to avoid the history lesson here. Let me explain. No, there is too much. Let me sum up.

Buttercup is marrying Prince...oh, wait.

For scotch ales, for five gallons, one to four quarts of a very active starter will be required. The pitching rate is as important a factor in creating Scotch and Scottish ales as the malt, the mash temperature and the hop rate. (Noonan, pg 83).

And, here's a weird one. Dr. Brown (again) advises that oxygenation of the wort must be minimal; ""low oxygen and a low initial temperature are necessary to control esters by reducing yeast growth. Five-fold yeast growth is even too great for Scottish beers; the pitching rate must be great enough that the yeast needn't exceed three-fold growth, to control esters."" (Noonan, pg 95.)

Many recipes will have you add a malt extract to boost your OG. The amount of all-grain and sparging needed is...a lot. So much that second runnings are often collected and ""small beer"" is made from that.

And I said in another post, I'd recommend collecting a couple gallons of the first runnings (about 20-25%) and boiling it down to 1/2 to carmalize and brown, which will add more complex flavors.

Last of all, 'true' Scotch ales don't actually use peat-smoked malt. I did and liked it, but many historical recipes have simply Pale Malt, Carapils, and Roast Barley.

- **Airgun**: Makes hunting far more efficient. One of the toughest challenges will be feeding 20 people for a month. However, without knowing if there is someone who knows how to properly use a gun, and use it efficiently, I'm fearful it usefulness will be wasted.

- **Pack Animal**: I actually like this idea more than the MTB previously mentioned since it also provides an emergency food source. If you took something like a horse (you can definitely find a pack animal worthy horse for under 200$) then you even have something you can ride. Keeping a horse healthy means that foragers would also need to collect grass though. A horse can carry a /lot/ of weight too.

If not take humanist. Your second idea should be either defensive or offensive it comes down to personal choice. I went with defensive but if I did the run again I would probably go offensive. Your third idea should always be innovative when playing Prussia because it reduces army tradition decay. Your fourth idea should be defensive/offensive, whichever one you didn't take for your second. The rest of your ideas are completely up to you.

When dealing with big threats like Russia it helps enormously to be allies with France or Austria or both. France would be the better ally in the log run especially if you become emperor. And if you do become emperor make sure to eventually go to war with Austria and make them release styria and then make styria release Tirol. You will get about 35 imperial authority and Austria will be so small few countries will vote for them to be emperor. This is also helpful because Austria will tend to ally Russia so when you end up in a war against Russia it won't have to be a two front war.

Another strategy to use against Russia is to build the highest level forts you can along the border you share with them. Late in my game a level 9 fort took them 3 years to successfully siege. The defensive ideas along with the level 9 fort will cause 5% attrition for them. If you let them siege a few provenances they won't have enough manpower to fight your armies and defend their land.

I hope this will help you and if you have anymore questions just ask.

EDIT: when I did this game I didn't have much issue with money. I believe I took trade ideas as my fifth and collected from kiev and the Baltic sea. But I also built buildings that increase trade power which helped a lot.

If you are having trouble expanding into Russia then go right ahead and take out he Ottomans and Crimea. By the 1600s your armies will make theirs look like it's made of paper. And make sure you are reformed for that sweet 15% morale boost in war and the boost in trade when you're not.

Finally in the later game consider if you want become a republic and consider taking plutocratic ideas. They are pretty good including 10% morale boost. If you do decide to take plutocratic switch to a noble republic immediately after so you can still have royal marriages and they give 10% moral bonus.

&gt;**Early Lootbeam Concepts**

&gt;____

&gt;Hey guys,

&gt;Just wanted to post some very quick early sketches we've done for an alternative loot beam.

&gt;We can't choose, so let us know which one you like best!! 

&gt;'Do all of them' isn't useful :p - if only we had time!

&gt;[Lootbeam Concepts](http://i.imgur.com/vFCTepA.png)

&gt;____

&gt;**Update 27/06/2014**

&gt;____

&gt;The Ninja team are now full speed ahead with Boss Slayer!!!

&gt;For those paying attention, the two polls we had up last week are now closed. Results have determined that Death will be the representing NPC and the title unlock for killing all the bosses incorporated in Boss Slayer will be ""_ the Reaper""; which is nice as the two go quite well together.

&gt;Ana put some quick concepts for a new lootbeam (see above) on the forums, twitter, and reddit. We've kept an eye on what people have said, and it would appear a majority thought that the rainbow was the best. As such, this will be an unlockable reward through Boss Slayer.

&gt;Labl has started work on Death's office, the place you'll be going to receive your daily Boss Slayer task. Below is an early work in progress model of the area:

&gt;[Death's Office](http://i.imgur.com/w3WFNGo.png)

&gt;*(everything is still greybox so it is subject to change)*

&gt;Asherz has been working on a new interface which will display all the bosses available in Boss Slayer with total kills, fastest kill, available drops, as well as some other information. You'll also be able to see a variety of other monster kill counts on the interface as well.

&gt;That's all for this week... You stay classy Gielinor!

&gt;____


&gt;**Update 04/07/2014**


&gt;____

&gt;This week we've made a bit of a change to the face of the project. Now that Death has been voted in as the representing NPC, we decided to theme it a bit more around him and not so much existing Slayer.

&gt;Don’t worry, this won't change anything that we currently have planned, it just means instead of being **assigned** something, you're told to **reap** them instead. The implication being that you collect the souls of the monsters you kill for Death. This is something we're pretty excited about, it made sense to make the change, giving the content much more depth and context in game.

&gt;We mentioned before that we were going to be putting out a pre-release for this project which consisted of boss and monster kill tracking, as well as instanced boss kill timers. Asherz has been working away at getting this sorted as quick as he can so it can be put into game ASAP. This will give you a nice little head start at killing bosses, not only for practice but also towards some of the unlockable rewards going out with the main release a few weeks later.

&gt;Labl is still working away at the 3D environment for Death's office, and it's starting to look hawt! What do you think of this work in progress?

&gt;[Death's Office](http://i.imgur.com/JV3IuSd.png)

&gt;*(currently using Death's old model as a placeholder - also, Roddeck army not included)*

&gt;Ana has been putting some concepts together for one of the rewards that we haven't mentioned yet. I think we'll keep this one up our sleeves for a little while longer as it's pretty darn juicy. 

&gt;Stu O has managed to get his claws on a new Kalphite Queen model which he’s now bringing to life with some fresh animations. We’ll be adding this to our main release as a nice little booster. Again, let us know you think.

&gt;[New Kalphite Queen Model](http://imgur.com/a/ZrY19)

&gt;Finally, we've seen a few people asking for an ETA for this update. We're currently looking to have the pre-release ready to go out towards the end of this month and the actual release should be around the middle of August. This can obviously change but they're our expected release times for those that wanted to know. Quite annoying having to wait but it should definitely be worth it. 

&gt;____


&gt;**Update 14/07/2014**


&gt;____

&gt;The team have been continuing with what was mentioned in the last update; Stu O animating the Kalphite Queen, Labl on the 3D environment for Death's Office, leaving Ana and Asherz on the content side of the pre-release.

&gt;As previously mentioned the pre-release should be with you in the next few weeks; here is what we'll be putting out:

&gt;* **Boss Timers** - these are basically stopwatches which you can view during boss fights. They will only appear in instanced fights with a set group size selected, depending on the boss. When the main release comes out you will be able to view your personal best times for each boss.
* **Boss Kill Tracking** - this will track your boss kills in the background, but you won't be able to see how many until the main release comes out.
* **Slayer Monster Tracking** - the same as boss kill tracking but for a select group of slayer creatures that we were able to fit into the update. More creatures may be able to be tracked later, see our current list in the picture below.

&gt;For the Completionists out there, and those aiming for it, here are the new requirements that we're looking to add with the main updates release:

&gt;* **Completionist** - Kill all bosses to unlock ""_ the Reaper"" title, which will be lost whenever a new boss comes out. All the current bosses are bullet-pointed in the update made on 19/06/2014 on the first post of this thread.
* **Trimmed Completionist** - Unlock all permanent rewards through Boss Slayer. This is a time trial more than anything else, I guess depending on how good you are at bossing will determine how quickly you'll be able to complete this requirement.

&gt;*Note: as kills are tracked with the pre-release, players can work towards the Completionist unlock from that update. Bosses killed before this update will not count towards the achievement. However, we do have existing achievements in-game which will allow us to give players one kill on certain bosses (Barrows &amp; Rots, Fight Caves, Fight Kiln, all GWD, QBD and Vorago including Hardmode) when the pre-release goes live.* 

&gt;Finally, we know you like looking at a few pictures so here are some more sneak peeks from the main release:

&gt;[Death's Office](http://i.imgur.com/TG0OJxB.jpg)

&gt;*Starting to come together really nicely but still a bit off completion, says Labl*


&gt;[Slayer Creatures](http://i.imgur.com/wf5soRQ.png)

&gt;*No kills = #noob*


&gt;[Incomplete Hydrix](http://i.imgur.com/cs7Keh3.png)

&gt;*...and what could this be?*

&gt;____

&gt;**Update 22/07/2014**

&gt;____

&gt;The pre-release for Boss Slayer is now live!

&gt;We hope you enjoy the new timers and the comfort of knowing that your boss and creature kills are now being tracked. These features will hopefully create some healthy competition between players and we'll no doubt be developing some seasonal hiscores with them in mind in the not too distant future. 

&gt;With this now in the game you'll be able to start working towards some of the rewards that come with the main Boss Slayer update. For those aiming for the previously mentioned Completionist requirements, you'll now be able to do so. With the main release you’ll be able to see the information we’re now tracking in a new pane created by Asherz which will appear within the Adventurers interface. 

&gt;We've also done our best to backtrack whether some of the bosses have already been killed by players based on the data we had stored. If we could prove that a player had killed a boss at least once we gave them a kill, which we thought would help those that wouldn't want to replay a particular boss. Here is a list of the bosses we've backtracked and the requirement to be given a kill:

&gt;* **Barrows** - Checks if the player has obtained the Barrows icon during the Temple of Senntisten quest.
* **Barrows: Rise of the Six** - Checks that Barrows: Rise of the Six has been completed.
* **Commander Zilyana** - Checks if the player has obtained the Saradomin lore book.
* **General Graardor** - Checks if the player has obtained the Bandos lore book.
* **Har-aken** - Completion of the Fight Kiln.
* **Kree'arra** - Checks if the player has obtained the Armadyl lore book.
* **K'ril Tsutsaroth** - Checks if the player has obtained the Zamorak lore book.
* **Nex** - Checks if the player has obtained the Nex lore book.
* **Queen Black Dragon** - Obtained the first Dragonkin journal.
* **TzTok-Jad** - Completion of the Fight Caves, or sacrificed a fire cape.
* **Vorago** - Checks that Vorago has been mauled personally.
* **Vorago (Hardmode)** - Checks if the player has unlocked '_ the Defeater' title.


&gt;Now for an exclusive! Here's a cosmetic override set that you'll be able to earn piece-by-piece for killing certain amounts of bosses. Let me just warn you, this won't be easy to obtain, only those that are true masters of PvM will be able to unlock it. Ana has done an awesome job in the concept, tying in elements from the bosses of Gielinor into one truly epic outfit. What do you think?

&gt;[Boss Slayer Reward Outfit](http://i.imgur.com/kHcbW8f.jpg)

&gt;Also on the development side of things, Labl has now finished Death's office! No picture this time as we want the final form to be a surprise on release. You'll be able to travel to this area through a portal in Draynor, right next to the lodestone for easy access. Labls next challenge will be to model the remaining reward items, including the outfit above, expect to see development on this in the coming weeks. Stu is polishing off his animation work on the updated Kalphite Queen model, and he’ll also be moving on to something new, animating Death in his new office.",1,wolfgang169,True,t3_2corwk,0,cjhihfi,0,1435079409,

This is laughable. The RPG elements were so shallow they might as well have not even been in the game. The talent tree did practically nothing to progress your character in any meaningful way. The only significant change that comes from it is basic stat boosts. Everything else didn't even remotely change the game play at all. At the end of the game I felt exactly as I did at the beginning besides some more health points and more ammo.

I just don't understand the praise this game gets. Everything about it is completely uninspired. Cookie cutter side quests copy and pasted all over the map. The same 500 collectables copy and pasted all over the map.Oh look another tower, just like the 10 others I have been to. Oh look, another base to take over, just like the 15 others I've been to. The entire game is a copy and paste job, just like all Ubisoft Montreal games. 

There is absolutely no depth to this game at all. In fact I don't think it could be any more shallow. ",2,Alestorm,True,t3_2coa7w,1,cjhhgev,0,1435077759,

Haven't actually got around to trying the DS2 DLC yet but I can assure that EW makes enough improvements on EU to make it worthwhile. Searching for meld forces you out of your safety zone, as you'll be rushing to try and collect the cannisters. Being able to genetically alter your troops or turn them into mechs is awesome and only makes it more heartbreaking when they die. The fight against EXALT is a nice change of pace, it gives you a welcome break from blasting aliens. EW also adds a bunch of new maps, especially nice are the UFO crash landings in cities, as opposed to EU where it was always in a forest. Some new council missions are added some new alien types, new weapons, foundry projects and medals which you can award your troops which give them a slight stats boost.

I love the fight caves and it's disappointing there is no incentive or reward for doing it well. 

The pre-eoc slayer jad task was in no way overpowered (You'd get more xp just cannoning an easy task) but it was very nice. 

It helped people that struggled to get their first cape (Slay mask boost)

It helped people that wanted to slay (Fun distraction to break up slayer grind)

It helped people that wanted to collect more firecapes (Incentive to do it and slightly faster cos mask) 

It was optional so people uncomfortable or unwilling to do the caves didn't have to.

It hurt nobody. Noobs couldn't just suddenly get firecapes. They still had to work for it and learn to do the prayer switching. It just shaved 5 minutes off the boring grind on the early waves.

The problem was that random dude somebody knew XY only got boosted through fucking flex and normal by completely overgeared people so all the stuff you just fuck away (like essences during Norushen) all of a sudden actually matters and they lose all ability to think for themselves. Actually, talking about Norushen, there is nothing more fun than saying ""random dude somebody knew XY, please take the orb"" and then nothing. Still nothing. Range indicator doesn't say he's OOR. Turn camera around to see if he's still there. Yup. Then on TS ""me?"", ""Yes, you!"", ""now?"", ""no! 30 seconds ago!"".

This is the type of shit you find if you take randoms with normal gear. My guild leader wiped for 7 fucking hours at normal Garrosh because everybody refused to take a tank that can actually play but might not be able to solo tank him due to gear. And do you know what? It fucking works. Because gear is so important in MoP, you can have ""random dude somebody know XY"" with shit gear solotanking garrosh because after getting through normal with a bunch of overgeared people that might still need an heirloom for an off spec or an alt a few times, you're invincible. I had a Paladin tank with 300k DPS in LFR who told me ""don't bother taunting. Less dps for me"". Luckily I always get lucky with other tanks in lfr so whilst I try to collect adds (that obviously die as soon as I see the tank fireing his shield into the adds because that dude is first in dps) and he's solo tanking garrosh, he explained me what I was actually supposed to do and when I was supposed to do it so I actually know the fight in case there's another not so well geared tank next time.

This is the current situation. If you outgear anything, it's fucking easy. So you can take braindead idiots into your raid and don't even notice who then in return are also overgeard and do the same fucking thing. If you don't have **INSANE** ideas about ilvl requirements (and I'm talking full heroic gear for CM or whatever), the gear simply doesn't matter. Do you know what would help? Old Achievement when the expansion was still current content. I'd trust somebody who has the rusted proto drake from ulduar 10 hm from back in the days and full timeless ""hurp durp I can open chests!"" gear more than mr full soo normal gear who got the achievement facerolling through ulduar on their own.

Go to gas planets to collect He and H.  Always get more back then you're spending.  The early stages are all about exploring and collecting fuel.  Your hull can take damage and be repaired by digging on any rock planet.  Oxygen and fuel are more precious. 

You should be hunting fuel and blueprints early on.  You don't need to carry around every hf Au or P element you dig up if you currently have no blueprints that require them. 

Always visit garden planets.  It refuel your oxygen and lets you interact with aliens.  You slowly learn their language but sometimes they just fear you and give you an omega.  Sometimes they'll teach you technology in trade. 

Geo scanner makes it easy to tell if there's an artifact on a rock surface.  Those artifacts then usually teach you more blueprints.  If you get a scanner,  it's worth visiting more planets to see their resources. 

Shields with the heat upgrade make it possible to harvest from the sun without dying.  This will make fueling your journey much simpler. 

Always visit the space station last if you can.  It will take one stat back to 100 so you want to be ready to warp to the next star before getting that little boost. ",3,nookfish,True,t3_2cna6a,0,cjhdafp,0,1435075680,

Part of the fun of Munchkin (for my group at least) is that ridiculous things happen and you just have to roll with the punches. Sometimes you'll be three turns into the game and encounter a Lvl 20 monster. Sometimes you get two GUAL cards in your initial hand. It's all part of the game and taking any card out just seems to possibly imbalance the game more so than it may already be.

It also depends on the expansion packs you buy. Easter Eggs seems to have the high level monsters that a lot of groups running Epic Munchkin wish for, while Penny Arcade adds in some great rules that can utterly change the way the game is played by restricting or hindering some real life actions.

My personal opinion in regard to getting started with expansion packs would be to look at some of the collected editions already out there. Holiday Surprise collects 4 Christmas themed boosters plus a few extras. Munchkin Game Changers adds in some of the more wacky boosters that make everything crazier; added monster modifiers or game changing combo cards.

Shwip is the combination of tight controls, beautiful minimalistic visuals, compelling gameplay modes and an array of weapons and abilities new to the shmup genre. Shwip features a world of intelligent enemies who gang up, flank, swarm, and catch you off guard. However, your arsenal of weapons and abilities will help you punish those who seek to destroy you in ways that are almost **too** satisfying. Our testers have said Shwip feels better than Geometry Wars, and that our sound design is phenomenal. Words we take pride in!

**Introductions**

*Rob - Co-founder / Design / Art*

I'm primarily the creative guy. John and I have been best friends for over 20 years, an almost scary fact, so we know how to read and talk to one another. I'm also doubling as the project manager on this game, along with creating art, running our social channels and creating any trailers and media. It's a daunting task, but I enjoy it. 

*John - Co-founder / Programming*

John is an immensely talented programmer. He's been able to consistently make any idea happen in the real world. Shwip wouldn't be the game it is today without him.   

**Progress**

We just launched our public arcade mode beta test. Shwip will have 4 main modes, along with accompanying local multi-player. The beta features only one mode, and we are currently collecting stats and feedback from our players. If you'd like to give our shmup a try, [you can download the beta here:](http://jamhammer.ca/downloads/shwipbeta1001.zip)

After we implement feedback from our Beta, we'll go on to complete the other modes. You can read about those modes on either our site, or greenlight.

**Pixel Boat Rush - A frantic guns-based 8-bit arcade boat racing game coming soon for iOS, Android and Mac**

***

Started in February 2013, Pixel Boat Rush is our largest project so far (you might already know us from Don't Run With a Plasma Sword or Platforms Unlimited). The game is meant to be accessible to everyone but challenging and deep enough to be enjoyed by mid-core and hardcore players. It should be released in roughly a month.

***

**Gameplay**

The core of the game is quite simple, a one-touch racing mechanic where you touch to accelerate and release to brake. If you brake before the tip of a wave, you'll stick to it. If you jump off a wave and brake while in the air, you'll fall faster. The idea is to capture the essence of electric racing tracks but applied to a sidescrolling boats race context. 

However, there's a second button, for weapons, which adds a completely different dimension to the game. There's simple guns, shotguns, machine guns, rockets, lasers, mines, grenades launcher, rail guns, beam guns, boomrangs, stun guns, burst guns, blasters, torpedoes, etc. The game becomes tactical as you save your ammo for the right moment or retreat to a more secure position.

After the second half of the game, another button is introduced for a secondary weapon or an active system which can stun, boost, jump, repair or shield.

The progression of the game has similarities with games like Gran Turismo where you progress through licenses tests and races spread across 4 racing categories. There's about 50 different boats, each having its own equipments configuration and behaviour, characterized by top speed, acceleration, downforce, braking and armor. Boats acquired can be upgraded.

***

**Main Features**

* Arcade and career mode
* 15 racing tracks
* 6 types of race
* Licenses: a series of mini-quests to pass in order to unlock the next racing category
* 50 racing boats, each with its own specific upgradable configuration.
* over 20 types of guns
* Power-ups: boost, ammo, shield, coins, repair
* Training mode against your best ghosts
* RPG-like parodic conversations with characters and categories champion inspired from the popular culture
* Pixel damage: when a boat takes damage, bits of the boat fly-off
* Trophies system: finish first in all races to collect all gold trophies
* Achievements and leaderboards (based on best lap time)

* When you aren't at war, lower your maintenance, and only raise it when necessary.
* If you are swimming in manpower, use a higher ratio of infantry, because they are cheaper than cavalry and artillery (but less manpower efficient).
* Make sure you are [trading efficiently](http://www.reddit.com/r/eu4/comments/2cizau/can_anyone_eli5_how_trade_in_this_game_works/). Try to funnel a large amount of trade (mainly from Western Europe and Liguria) into Sevilla while dominating the node to maximize your trade income. If you've taken many of the Bordeaux node provinces, you can probably collect from there as well.
* Make sure to build trade buildings on provinces with natural bonuses e.g. Important Center of Trade, Rhine Estuary, etc. for the most efficient boost in trade power.
* Positive stability gives you a bonus tax modifier, so if you're overflowing with admin points, raise your stability to get an extra tax boost.
* **Make sure you don't have too many colonies**, because the cost of extra colonies increases exponentially.
* You should be able to maintain 1-1-1 advisers at the minimum. 2-stat and 3-stat advisers are a luxury.
* If you're really struggling, try the Economic or the Trade idea groups to aid your income.
* If you're at war, send a few regiments to loot enemy territory, stopping at each province. This can be done once every 6 months. Only provinces that are not bordering provinces you have access to can be looted, so this is mostly limited to larger countries. Provinces that cannot be looted include provinces next to your own, provinces next to your allies', provinces next to countries you have military access to, provinces next to provinces you've occupied, and provinces next to HRE provinces (if you are at war with the emperor).
* Don't be afraid to take out a few loans to build buildings, if your inflation can handle it.",3,Jhohok,True,t3_2cll9p,0,cjgp6mw,0,1435063849,

      * Note: We are looking at making broader improvements to the Inspiration you receive from Enchanting and its overall progression in an upcoming update.
  * Changed the enchantment prefixes for veteran glyphs:

**Exploration &amp; Itemization**  
*General* 

  * 47 new achievements have been added to the game across all sections, from crafting to dungeons to PvP, and many of these new achievements will have dyes associated with them. 
      * If you have already completed the challenge mentioned in the achievement, in many cases you will be back credited for the new achievement. For example, becoming Emperor is a new achievement in the game, and any previous or current emperors will receive credit for this achievement.

Now for a TD;LR:

* The basic premise is intact. A good mood is needed for good performance, and there are requirements. Except the latter are...required this time around, while they were leintant in TS3.
* Each career has an ideal emotion that particularly boosts performance. (Inspired for the Writing career, for example.)
* Requirements not only include skills, but also certain tasks. (A Writing requirement is to overcome writer's block.)
* Other ways to earn money: **collecting**, gardening, writing, etc.
* Features that are back: Promotion cash bonuses, career reward items, homework, retirement, **chance cards**, career branches **but for all jobs**.

That same person wrote another series of essays that were collected and published as another book about 20 years later, titled ""The 12 Steps and 12 Traditions"" that includes what he had learned with 2 dozen years of sobriety under his belt.  It's a much less deity focused look at the actual recovery program of AA, the 12 steps.  And even that book is a bit outdated obviously and doesn't include what AA, as a whole, has learned over the past 60 years.  For that you end up reading the pamphlets found on AA.org and listening/talking with others in AA.

A lot of reading I know, but it's good stuff and it's all important.

The ""power greater than yourself which can restore you to sanity"" doesn't have to be a sky wizard.  For some it is, and that's OK.  It matches up with the original 1930's AA literature and it works for them.  But for many, probably most, that ""power"" is simply action.  If you put aside the whole ""pray and look for a deity's influence in your life"", what you have is a set of attitudes and actions that work.  What we do in AA is actually an earlier form of CBT.  We act our way into better thinking.  We drag our bodies to these fellowship gatherings with similar people and get a temporary attitude boost as well as connect with them.  But where the real progress is made is in not drinking, learning about ourselves, wanting to become better people, righting the wrongs we've perpetrated, and helping others to do the same.

I feel like it's a little less linear now - I'm guessing I'm maybe halfway through the game - but it's missing what made Prime 1 unique and that's a shame because the gameplay itself is more interesting, with better puzzles and more intense combat.

I'm not considering any of these cards priceless treasures or anything. As long as you've got some neat Pokemon stuff, I'll trade.

2: Looking through the cards gave me these numbers: There are 36 cards from Chaotic, including 9 rares and an Ultra Rare, no duplicates. There are also 36 Digimon cards, including 2 holos (these were shown in the album - Platinumsukamon and Babamon), and one or two duplicates on top of that. There are 4 Harry Potter cards plus a duplicate (it's a Lesson card and looks like the equivalent of a Pokemon Energy card). The Neopets and Duel Masters cards shown in the album are the only ones I have (so one from each game). And lastly, there are 33 English Dinosaur King cards and 10 Japanese ones, including 2 English holos and 1 Japanese holo, plus the mat, manual, and jumbo card and one or two duplicates. The other non-Pokemon stuff is all non-game trading cards (Jurassic Park 3, Mighty Beanz, Monsters Inc, Nascar, etc). I also have a Dinosaur King booster wrapper and four Chaotic booster wrappers.

For Neo Genesis, which is mostly done, [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/58496258/Documents/CardsNeoGenesis.txt) is a list of what I don't have (it's a general checklist I've been using so rares are on there, you can just leave those out if you don't want to trade them).

It wasn't one of those semi-comforting quiets, beginning after a collective decision conveyed by glances and intrinsic human connection alone. No we'd had a fair bout of quite vocal screeching and panic.

It was the magnitude that kept us from meaningful action. As we first descended to the surface the plains showed no signs of disturbance, no odd spots that stood out. So it took us a while to realise the plains were not dust and dirt but metal and machinery. It's vastness elicited the same reaction that has been seen many times before. Disbelief leading to anger then to...well classically bargaining. Unfortunately this smooth transition was buffeted at the anger stage by a great range of fright amongst the crew due to the aforementioned magnitude of the whole event.

And now we're here. Sitting, pacing or otherwise negating to address the veritable civilisation that we would soon be settling on. Or would that be invading? Even now I'm just replaying the whole sequence. Not planning our or even my next step, just turning it over and over, revolving without movement.

Something needs to be done. It may be what everyone is actually thinking. So no pressure. Just take the initiative. Screw this, stand up, start the conversation. Be that guy. Though doing that felt like I was admitting to an unfavourable reality, it was nonetheless a reality. 

I stood up. Eyes flicked my way, desperate to escape the vacant fear present within themselves.  

""We need to - 

A cascade of lights struck our spacecraft without warning, spilling through the viewing panels in to our communal quiet room and taking me as their first victim. Searing my eyes I feel to the floor disoriented, hearing panic ignite once more. Our once slowed descent seemed to be receiving an unwanted boost. And all too soon we were on the surface. Mars. If only humanity could see us now;bit more exciting than ""one giant leap"" and all that. 

We no longer needed to make the first move, which ironically had us scrambling to make one. A New Hope style door removal was currently taking place, courtesy of our mechanical welcoming party. Sprinting towards the limited space suits was each and every one of us, being both symbolic and actual protection from the distinctly un-Earth like world beyond the airlock doors.

But my brief incapacitation had left me behind the herd. And being behind the herd gave me all the perspective I needed. As we ripped, clawed and generally unleashed hell on one another in pursuit of these suits we had lost all semblance of camaraderie or even vague civility. The planet hopping pioneers were in survival mode. I looked away from the chaos towards the second airlock door - our last barrier to a new world. It was the last decision I ever made.

Its motors were tired and worn, a deficiency not helped by the distinct lack of stored energy after slicing the blockades apart. Rotating its head it observed a large number of floating blockades. It further observed the inefficiency of these blockades, with extraneous protruding masses from the a central mass. A quick scan from rover one revealed little hidden aid within these masses.

Honestly just go play single player or private group mode if you don't like the open play model. If you don't like your Elite: Dangerous having people who can, and may possibly, kill you then you shouldn't really be playing. No one is asking for an option to make npcs disappear because npcs are easy. This just shows that people who want this just want the game to be easy and care-free (which is fine and you can play solo or private group). Either they don't have the skill or knowledge to match up with others and they think they should just make their problems disappear rather than grow from a situation.

I once had O_Wolfpac camp outside a station in an anaconda back at the end of Premium Beta (keep in mind that in the premium beta an anaconda can tank a station for 1-2 minutes easy) trying to collect my 230k credit bounty that I had. I didn't just /ignore him and make the threat go away. I took the time to think about the situation and tried to escape. I decided to boost out the station and turn on silent running so i can't be targeted. I used a heatsink so I can still fly and boost without overheating from silent running being on. I got away and did it again when he tried to do it at the next station I went to.

What happened to the OP was probably just a bug since I have died to stations many times for trying to kill people near the station. Also what seems like a bug rather than a feature is the fact that if you assault a ship outside the no fire zone the station will still attack you. What's the point of a no fire zone if you can't fire anywhere even outside of it? I have died once from this and survived twice despite being outside the no fire zone.

If you don't want the multiplayer experience, meaning the whole thing, then don't play in open play.

It takes *very* few votes early-on to tip the tide of a post. That's upvotes or downvotes. Three or four immediate upvotes in /new can make a post visible to everyone else. Three or four downvotes on a new post can make it invisible to everyone, never to have a chance to see the light of day.

/r/unidan was using four or five vote bots to upvote his submissions. This doesn't sound particularly heinous but he didn't stop there. Unidan was also using his bots to downvote people who disagreed with him. He bitched out when explaining it and said he was downvoting ""misinformation"". Turns out he was also downvoting people on the same level of comments as his, even when completely unrelated, to give his posts more visibility in the threading of posts.

How can this be harmful to reddit? I'm glad you asked, voice I'm attributing to OP! Last year there was a huge debale in /r/AdviceAnimals. You may or may not heard of a site called QuickMeme. QuickMeme was an image macro generator site built by a redditor. You could overlay text on common memes easily to post them. It was convenient and a fairly decently built site. It was okay. It wasn't fantastic but it was useful. Eventually people started noticing that /r/AdviceAnimals was completely *dominated* by QuickMeme-hosted images. It just didn't make sense. Sure, QuickMeme was good but it wasn't Imgur-kiling good. Lots of us still have Photoshop installed and use it. People got suspicious.

People brought it up only to ever get buried in downvotes early on (and as I mentioned it doesn't take many early on). Until eventually a couple of redditors actually decided to do some digging. An amateur investigation uncovered that **every** non-QuickMeme link was being downvoted almost immediately after submissions by 3-8 votes. Every QuickMeme submission was getting the exact opposite vote weight almost immediately. I don't remember if this was prior knowledge or not, but it became known that one of the /r/AdviceAnimals moderators was the owner of QuickMeme, a for-profit site that was collecting ad revenue from reddit links.

The guy who owned QuickMeme got tens of thousands of dollars in ad revenue from reddit by suppressing the submissions of others. He did it in a way that any idiot with an amateur understanding of Python, the reddit API, and Wordpress, could knock out in a week. Literally *anyone* can throw this shit together and cause massive vote manipulation on reddit.

As far as anyone knows Unidan just did it for the internet fame. It is damaging to the site, though. Exploiting bots to ""boost"" your submissions with upvotes is one (still shitty) thing. Suppressing other content for your own gain is ultimately fucking lame and anyone who does it deserves ultimate shame and a permaban.

I wouldn't say that he did anything 'wrong' in the video, per se, but I'm viewing it as someone who knows he isn't sincere. He walked up to her and complimented her and pretended that he was interested in getting to know her and she doesn't know what we know - that this is just a game he's playing for YT likes and to collect phone numbers to brag to other PUAs. To me, she seemed to react the way a polite girl who is flattered that someone is interested in her might react. She didn't seem like she was being swept off her feet by a man she couldn't wait to hop into bed with.

He isn't my type at all, but I would have reacted much the same as the woman in this video, because I find it really hard to get away from people when they 'trap' me in a conversation because I feel like that would be rude and if I thought someone was being sincere I wouldn't want to hurt their feelings by blowing them off.

She doesn't seem too interested in him, to me. That is just my own opinion. And there's no way to know if he managed to 'seal the deal' with her or whatever lingo these guys use. Text messaging back and forth with a girl whose number you have to practically pry out of her with a bar doesn't prove much in regards to how well this system works for meeting someone and *keeping* them interested.

The problem with a lot of these videos is they rely on the surprise attack. Catch people off-guard, baffle them with a lot of rambling and then demand their phone number. I do wonder how many of these women reply to a few text messages and then just add these guys to their black book apps? And of course then the PUA would say that it's because women are irrational and incapable of taking the initiative. It's not that the approach is flawed, it's that women are stupid and you just have to work the system around them as best as you can.

As for your situation. There are women out there who aren't interested in looks. I know that that is a cliche and I'm not trying to pull a line on you like your mum and tell you that the right girl will love you for you or whatever.

Of course there are women out there who are shallow and date based on looks alone, but I think that personality is more important to most women. At least to myself and the women that I know. In fact, a good personality makes an unattractive person attractive, if that makes sense.

There isn't anything wrong with losing weight (if you're heavy), improving your health and improving your wardrobe. If your friend is doing those things you could get into that aspect of it and maybe enlist his help with buying clothes or working out? Usually shaping up and getting new clothes is a huge confidence boost in itself and then you might not need a lot of 'how to harass women in public' videos.

I can tell you as a woman myself, we're not another species. We're not impossible to talk to. TRP often warns against putting women on a pedestal and in a sense I agree with them. In the sense that women aren't like tigers or something where if you approach us with the wrong set of skills you'll end up with your face mauled off. We can be treated like regular people.

My point is you can take some good from it, but I wouldn't rely on any PUA or MRA or TRP techniques when it comes to actually talking to a woman and certainly don't believe anything they say when it comes to the way women feel or think.

You are not Conan, but this is the type of place Conan lives in.
You're the type of peasant he knocks aside and as you emerge from that trough a wizard abducts you. Trapped in a grotesque prison you turn to your one nerdy pursuit reading. Soul Sacrifice uses the meta-narrative to further its gameplay, and much like Assassin's Creed those novel skills carry over to the ""real world"" however unlike Assassin's Creed the game with in a game really works. You see you're reading the journal of the insane necrophile that trapped you in a cage of human bones. Desperation in the real world means the readings become surprisingly engaging especially as they involve a blood thirsty femme fatale who for reasons not yet revealed saves said future necrophiliac super crazy cannablistic wizard guy. The result is a monster hunter clone that is strangely anti-monster hunter. While the gory fantasy world is at odds with my taste, the set up works perfectly to make the gameplay more intriguing and the game has the balls to lets you decide which of 6 weapons you want to bring into battle. The result is blood spewing machine gun replicates (doesn't work) to some beautiful and hefty ice swords to a pumpkin headed charge move. Loot is weapons in this game and weapons have about the shelf life as say a cauldron of healing potions or some twizzlers. Weapons wear out giving them a disposable feeling, but these little disposable tinker toys have surprising effects. The game lacks the Monster Hunter traps so far, but honestly this is quite different from monster hunter. Soul Sacrifice is an Inafune game to the core, weapon swaps are constant &amp; the humor never ends. The game's central mechanic revolves around the bleak surroundings and the sacrifice or save mechanic, which is nice I like choosing my exp and the moral decision to sacrifice or save is fun especially as this Conan like world values life about as highly as a Mars bar. The game encourages you to be a bad guy and Being a compulsive psychopath obsessed with collecting attack level ups is rewarding. Haven't even gotten to the online play yet, but did i mention this is a romance novel too? Yes, that insane psychopath full of eyes and gore above was in love, how he ended up insane and if learning his old spells will really help you is for you to decide. Good work japan studio.... Just please the blood machine gun thing... No. Oh btw just played the demo am sold on full game pretty sure original and then maybe Delta. Also now super crazy hype for mighty no. 

**BlazBlue Chronophantasma**
There are two types of learning (I have identified in BB) the conscious and environmental learning. In League of Legends I kept playing for awhile after 30, but I never actually broke the game down and gave it serious consideration. I didn't know why Annie is good against Shaco, it was simply instinctual. Similarly I didn't know why Amane is good against Hakumen or why I squirm a little whenever Bullet comes on the screen, but then it began to occur to me that my long range gives me a distinct advantage against Hakumen's slow, but powerful attacks while Bullet's heavy barrage of up close combos can devastate me quickly. I searched around for combos to slightly improve my damage vs up closers, but this is the thing BlazBlue is a game that goes out of its way to make sure you understand you need to analyze and think about this game. The result is I am working on combos to repel Bullets, Noels, &amp; other close range characters. Similarly Amane is much much weaker than other characters especially in terms of damage. I can be up 10 hits on a character and still have less life. The results are I know Amane needs combos, obviously I have to power up the drill and then end some 10 hit combo with it in order to really win. In other words I am consistently receiving feedback on my game, its just despite all of this I constantly lose. An early game day zero Hakumen or Hazama can over whelm a day zero Noel easily. The reason is their damage output is just higher.  I don't see Hazama in competitive play, but he's all over the noob charts in ranked games. But getting back to the environmental learning, we don't always learn in words, but BB is a game that gives us words in order to manifest the learning we acquire from experience. Its just that in my case this growing awareness of the strategies involved means I am over confident in my ability to grow, hence why I suck at this game so much :) p.s. Sorry Bb community for all the lag, its Vietnam. Edit: had 3 wins in a row in ranked today.

Edit: and environmental learning is a kind of manipulation its perfectly possible to build a character whose weaknesses will make you dread playing her, but whose design inspires. In other words its possible Amane is a joke character like Dan intended to troll a demographic as much as the Archers in Chivalry are woefully underpowered. If the designer knows they are designing a low tier character does that make Amane trans-phobic? However, I think time will tell. (Have seen some awesome Amane players). The bigger question is if playing her will pay dividends in the future. However concerning environmental learning, what does this say about LoL? Does the environment of the game teach players to be more toxic? Would better consciousness of the game's system make pro games more enjoyable? And when designing an environment how should it manipulate the player? Dark Souls is famously difficult, but rewarding meanwhile many FPS games are empowering, but simple. My point is digital environments offer people a future, a temporality &amp; context that manipulate their daesin, the experience of being digitally can have influence on our daily lives.

**Final Fantasy IX**
I had a lot of free time this week which probably means I forgot something important. This game has been covered in depth or to death if you prefer as I write this a neogaf thread once again praises the merits of this game. I arrived in Lindblum, discovered Cid's secret, and met Freya. The second I stepped outside Lindblum I just wanted to walk around and get out of the story, well ok actually I didn't but you get the idea. The immense freedom of the over world (which is illusionary) pales compared to the story, the game lets you know a coliseum battle and a fetch quest for Cid are coming up with out check boxes or some type of to-do list simulator and that might be the thing about FF IX: it lets you explore. I know Cid needs me to find his wife and experimental airship, I know I will end up in the festival of the hunt, but unlike so many modern games that shuttle you from objective to objective FF IX stands up and says explore. You're not given a way point marker that tells you where to go, instead the narrative is compelling enough that I know where to go already, its just I would rather level my character outside, get my mage masher up to snuff, and then synthesize a few weapons before getting into this festival that will no doubt lead under the city somehow. Objectives are well managed, I do wish it kept track of all the optional side quests you receive like the coffee beans guy etc.

**F1 Race Stars**
Mario Kart 8 just didn't grab me so far... and F1 Race Stars on steam alienated me too, but this little codemasters cash grab is exactly what I need. The tilt controls actually work... I mean like really work as in I prefer them to a virtual joystick. Secondly, you know how in Mario kart those shells hurt and like for a second you really think your racer is in pain? F1 Race Stars uses bubbles, you gently float skyward for a few seconds. I can't quite identify what about the game makes it great. It has every evil an ios games could have: ubiquitous pop ups asking for my cash, a fairly blatant pay to win model, yet its short tracks (races are cut down to commute digestible lengths) and surprisingly adept motion controls are really enchanting. The game makes you feel good for playing and the bubbles are much better than the shells, maybe the reduced course length also adds something? I also like that you take damage, your wheels corrode as you drift and get hit by bubbles resulting in pit stops. This mechanic works even though it is part of the micro-transaction fest the game exhumes like oxygen and dollars are somehow comparable. I only gave this a minute so my impressions lack analysis and nuance, but so far I am impressed. Oh btw drifts store boost which is released via a button. Like that too. Its like someone took an axe to mario kart and came away with a cherry. Edit: I was just forced to spend an ingame currency to buy a new driver there by losing my upgrades. Le sigh its like someone forcing you to masturbate. Don't need a game that makes me practice desiring in-game purchases. Good game, solves many mario kart conundrums, but I think I will stick with MK8.

Note: my weekly thoughts on stuff I am playing is now to long for reddit. Had to cut 2 games. I still update my blog with my design journals so if you happen to want to know my thoughts on Atelier Totori or Borderlands 2 this week: http://dignifieddevil.wordpress.com",9,liminal18,True,t3_2cfyrc,0,cjf880l,0,1435037562,

It's then installed in a chassis, controlled as our body is; Infantry still has a humanoid form because it's the only form most people know how to control, and learning how to control something else takes time. The brain is fed with a precise nutrient solution; To ease logistics, a bulky device popularly known as a 'squad stomach' may be carried, to produce this solution from various biological materials found in the field.

Matter can be precisely altered at a level more fundamental than chemistry, creating exotic materials previously unavailable and unknown. Among them are substances of extreme density, which are difficult to anchor to more conventional matter, so different devices using them tend to be found together in ""hyperdensity compartments"" designed for that. A typical infantry chassis has three such compartments; They are elongated, and placed inside the thighs and abdomen. In one end they have a neutrino transceiver; Neutrinos pass through matter so easily, a signal of them can pass right through the planet unimpeded. This also means they are difficult to detect, requiring compact receivers to have an extremely dense ""antenna"". In the other end they have the (longer)power source, whose considerable mass is being transformed directly into energy. Around them flows the coolant in its largest concentrations; It travels around the suit in extremely narrow tubes in a thinned-out form, able to collect and store enormous amounts of heat before needing to get rid of it. The thigh compartments have their transceiver pointing downwards, and the abdominal compartment has it pointing upwards, reducing interference. The abdomen is also where the brain is located, where it is well-armored, and may have an escape pod that takes the abdominal hyperdensity compartment with it.

The outer layer of armor looks metallic. Aside from being very dense and smooth, when energized it maintains and restores its own shape; In this state, it is far stronger than conventional matter can be, separating a piece off it is extremely difficult, and when it does get damaged it repairs itself; Tears close, metal fatigue disappears.

The layer under it is an intricate mix of fibers, dilatant, fluids, capillaries and sensors, as well as nanobots whose main function are maintenance, repair and protection from hostile nanobots. In the center is the endoskeleton, which has the motors.

Out of crevices between the armor plates, a metamorphing material can be deployed to cover the chassis. It's not very strong, but can take on a structure that's good at redirecting and changing electromagnetic radiation(especially light) entering it, dissipating the beams of beam weapons, and hiding the chassis from view. It can be withdrawn back inside just as quickly.

The head, pauldrons, wrists and shins are covered in various sensors, tiny and distributed. For point defense, the pauldrons and shins also have solidstate laser turrets; Semispherical objects that can emit a powerful laser beam in any direction that forms a direct line between the surface and where the sphere's center would be, and change direction extremely quickly without actually moving anything. Even hails of bullets can be deflected this way, the beams digging holes in them that eject rapidly-expanding vapors- In other words, rockets.


Railguns of all sizes are common. The material that the rails and the outer skin of the rounds are made of is a room-temperature superconductor, and when two smooth objects made of it rub against one another at a flat enough angle, it is completely frictionless. Rounds are usually made to rapidly spin before being launched, and although they are often the size of a sewing needle, they more than make up for it with their density and extreme velocity. Many of them act as memory materials; They can transform(not simply break) into multiple needles, either straight ones during flight, or spiraling ones after entering a target to spread the damage. Depending on their size, each needle may have electrically-boosted explosives, or even a tiny fusion bomb. Rounds may also use this quality to steer themselves, with or without fins.

Many kinds of beam weapons are also available, including X-ray lasers and neutron rays.",1,YairJ,True,t3_2c7lmt,0,cjf560e,0,1435036178,

Artifact depletion would be problematic for most of the in-game items though, but might work in some cases.  And yeah, you'd need to modify a good number of the foci, but ultimately I'm curious if it would be better modify the abilities classes can get or just create new ones from scratch.  At the moment I'm leaning towards the former.

I suggested something like a skill or asset for the Ghosts only because if each character is going to have one, what makes theirs special?  Maybe a particular knowledge skill, maybe a knack for breaking and entering?  I can understand why they wouldn't build into the video game, but in a tabletop setting a player may want to play someone who can break into computer systems and doors, maybe with the help of their Ghost.

I still think XP can work fine the way it is, as it's more long-term.  Light was something I felt could be more short-term, a currency used as a means to activate your super and a way to help others.  Perhaps it could be spent to give an ally a boost in a difficult roll, or it's necessary to revive a downed comrade, or maybe to call upon the powers of the Traveler to perform a more free form stunt.  A successful use of a super means light is collected by other players, or maybe a stunt or any other action that significantly helps someone gets you Light.  Something that clearly communicates to the player, ""This is your pool of awesome, cultivate and use it.""  Another idea would be to have Light be a pool shared by the party.

Also to take into account is that player characters don't all have the same origin anymore.  Whether or not you remember your past, where you were resurrected, how you got to the City, and etc can be a nice way of getting back story worked into every group.

It makes sense in a video game with limited character slots to allow swapping of subclasses, but in a game like Numenera, it might make sense to restrict choices to one subclass by picking an element (Void, Solar, Arc) and sticking to options in the class related to that element; probably only the grenade, melee, and super options.

You could even have mechanical differences whether someone is Human, Exo, or Awoken.  It's simpler to not worry about it, but for some players that might be a pleasant change from the video game.",1,Skwiziks,True,t3_2cfprl,0,cjf4rc0,0,1435035925,

0,,t1_cjezwy7,2,1407000562,,t1_cjet9xc,1407000830,Games,False,,t5_2qhwp,"&gt;Reading this, it explains exactly why Blizzard made Diablo 3 the way they did. The way you describe Diablo 2 sounds a lot like work.

It took them 12 years to make Diablo 3. Blizzard North started on it almost immediately after LoD. Then when Blizzard North left the company after working on the game for 4 years, Blizzard started the whole game from scratch. Took them 7 years to make the version that we got. They put in way more work than any action rpg should need.

D2 only took 3 years to make, and 1 year for the expansion. It would have been less work to make a D3 based off of improving and building upon what worked in D2. Instead of removing everything and going in a completely different direction.

&gt;There's a reason games like Path of Exile and Torchwood fall off the map not too long after they release, and there's a reason why Diablo 3 is still being talked about years after its release, despite it's no-so-great reputation.

Path of Exile hasn't fallen off the map. It just recently won a bunch of awards in 2013. And it will have a boost of players again when the next act is released in 2015. The reason it hasn't stayed as mainstream game (it was one of the most popular games on Twitch for several months) is because of the desyncing and other coding problems. Not because it has depth. If PoE was made by Blizzard it would have been way more polished. And ended up being bigger than both what both D3 and PoE are combined.

Torchlight 2 was a decent game. But it doesn't have server side saves. Which makes the online part kind of a joke. Your characters information is saved on your computer. Anyone can edit that give them selves maxed out stats, plus the best items. It also doesn't have that much depth to it. It's a fun game to play for a couple weeks.

D3 doesn't get talked about for being an awesome game. The best anyone has to say about it nowadays is that everyone admits that 1.0 was crap, but that 2.0 has fixed stuff up a bit. Beyond that RoS has fallen off the map. It doesn't get talked about in the mainstream since the first week it came out. No one plays it on Twitch. It's already reached a low level of players that D2 didn't get to until WoW came out, and sucked up Blizzard's rpg players.

&gt;If you want to play Diablo 2, then why not play Diablo 2?

When I want to play it, I do. I levelled up an Assassin during this most recent ladder reset. I've already seen and done everything that D2 can offer, although it can still be fun from time to time. What I really wanted was a sequel that was worthy of the franchise. And something that has an active community then way B.net 1.0 was for over a decade.

I wanted something that took what made D2 great and improved on it. That doesn't mean a carbon copy. D2 is very different from D1. But D3 doesn't feel like a well thought out Diablo game.

&gt;D3 is a great action-rpg for the time it came out. If Blizzard had made a game that was as complicated and hardcore as Diablo 2, it wouldn't have sold nearly as well, even if it did satisfy whole dozens of aging gamers.

D3 was a good game, not a great game. Not a Blizzard quality game.

It's not about complexity, it's about depth and accessibility. Complexity is bad. D2 had depth, but was accessible to the mainstream players. You didn't have to research the frame rate break points for your class in order to do good and have fun.

I was the biggest noob ever when I first started playing D2 (well I had at least played D1). I played the game for months before I finally got my first character that was over level 50. And yet I still had a blast with my friends. But after several years of playing we could get to 85 in a single evening. At which point the actual depth in the character building and item collecting is what kept us interested.

D2 was a game that was accessible for brand new players, yet was so good that you would end up learning as you played which just kept adding more appreciation to the game. It wasn't a complex game. It had both depth and accessibility. It turned noobs into more hardcore players. And made it fun in the process.

D3 on the other hand only focused on accessibility. Even to the point of removing depth for more accessibility. That's what Activision has pushed the company towards in order to maximize short term profits. But that is a bad move in the long term. Sure you can soak up a bunch of mainstream fans. But such games are not gonna keep people's interest for years at a time. The way all Blizzard games used to.

Dozens of aging gamers? D3 was the fastest selling pc game of all time. Why? Because it had Diablo written on the box. It had one of the biggest and most mainstream fan bases of all time. And this was a chance to make the series open up to the next generation of gamers. Which they failed on horribly. What they got was closer to a Torchlight game than a Diablo game.

1. Difficulty: Immortal
2. Map: Standard Pangaea (set to low sea level)
3. Game Speed: Standard
4. Random AIs (I got Inca, Austria, Venice, Ethiopia, India, Zulu, Babylon)

**Why Poland?**


Sub-300 victories are 25% civ-dependent. Civs that can easily do so are:


* Babylon - moar scientists


* Korea - specialist bonus before Secularism, and research boosts once certain buildings/wonders are built in the capital)


* Maya - amazing UB and very flexible UA. Now that Artists don't interfere with Scientists and Engineers, even more so


* Shoshone - you get the best starting tiles to snowball with


* Aztecs - Mega population. The capital can easily reach 40 pop without food caravans


* Poland - free policies mean you can guarantee opening Rationalism upon reaching Renaissance, along with some other funky stuff


* Inca - mountain bias.


The other 75% is the map, and everything that comes with it. Usually, fast SV's are done on Pangaeas, since there's a lower chance of isolation. It is also highly dependent on RA's, so if your neighbors are war-like (Mongols can destroy CSes, everyone else can be hyper aggressive) and deceptive (broken RA's are sunk costs), then it could grind out the cogs in your sub-300 engine. CS Placement and the types of CS will also affect this. A lack of Culture CSes can potentially slow your SP acquisition to a crawl, lack of Mercantiles can hamper your happiness and growth.


**Game Details**

I settled the Warsaw on turn 1 (moved one tile west so I can get on a Riverside Hill). Build order was Scout -&gt; Shrine -&gt; Monument -&gt; Worker -&gt; Archer -&gt; Archer. I built a Caravan once I saw that an Ethiopian city is near me and is on a safe route. This helped me get to Education quickly, since this is Immortal and the AI has bonuses, they have a lead in tech in the early game, which gives additional beakers per trade route from/to you. I managed to get to Education by Turn 120 and bought a University in my capital.

As you can see, I settled four cities. Second city was Krakow, then Lodz, then finally, Wroclaw. I was sending two food caravans to Warsaw, and one to Lodz. Wroclaw was settled on an Incense. The sea from my end was ice-locked (as I found out at around turn 200 or so, when I finally got an opportunity to build a Privateer), so no Sea Trade Routes were made.

There was only one war from my end (Ethiopia, don't go to war with me when I have Rockets and XCOMs and you have Cannons and WWI infantry), and I did not bribe people to go to war with each other. In the end, I was friends with Babylon, Inca, Austria, India (but they asked me to denounce Inca in the late game), Venice and Ethiopia (but I managed to get a lot of RA's from him). You need a lot of Friends in order to get a fast victory, because of all those RA's you're gonna sign. I also settled I think only 4 GSes for Academies. The last few RAs you will sign are right around at that time as well (for insurance).

After getting mg Public Schools, I took a small detour before going to Radio. Since my start has a LOT of Plains tiles (and I needed a few basic defenses, because I get reports that Ethiopia was plotting against me), I went to Fertilizer for the food then Dynamite, and produced 4 Artillery. Then I used Oxford to bulb Plastics and got all my Research Labs. After getting the Hubble, that was when I started bulbing scientists one per turn.

My religion was mainly centralized in my cities. My 20 FPT comes from Shrines, Temples and the Grand Temple. Beliefs were Religious Settlements (I was last pick on a Pantheon, and all my spare Spices are way out in the third ring), Tithe (because of course), Happy from Shrines (was unhappy at the time the Prophet spawned), Swords into Plowshares and Religious Texts. Spawned an extra prophet before getting into Industrial, and used that to spread my religion to my cities and a few CS for quests. While Religion itself isn't necessary, you still need some FPT, so you can clutch buy stuff (Great Scientists or Engineers).


**Poland-Specific tricks**


Because of our UA, we can get the benefits of BOTH Tradition and Liberty when they are at the most potent. The SP Path was as follows:

* Open Tradition
* Dip into Liberty until Collective Rule
* Back to filling Tradition (Landed Elite, Monarchy, Aristocracy, Oligarchy)
* Open Rationalism by the Renaissance Era (I had around 10 turns to spare on my natural culture SP pop)
* Go down left side of Rationalism
* Complete Rationalism
* Get Leaning Tower of Pisa
* Use Engineer on Porcelain Tower (I managed to complete Pisa on the same turn Architecture was done. Settle the GS for an Academy)
* Ideology as needed
* Because of my middling FPT, I completed the Liberty tree (Meritocracy was taken last) for another GE, which I used to pop Hubble. This gave me enough Faith to get one more Scientist.

Do note that if you use Oxford on Radio for a quick Ideology, you can't immediately pick a level 2 Tenet, since you get the SP upon entering Modern Era, and Ideology selection comes one turn later.


**Ideology**

In this game, I went for Order.  For fast SV's, it's really just a toss-up between Freedom and Order. In this game, I went for it simply because of Worker's Faculties. It provides 25% science on cities with Factories. I wasn't able to take advantage of this, since by Industrial Era, I was the tech leader (can't trade for it since my neighbors still haven't figured out that black thing was), and none of my CSes gave me coal. I couped one but it didn't provide me with them and I don't know why. The win would have been faster if I had coal, because I can build three factories for my Ideology, then used the free SP from the Modern Era slingshot (through Radio) to immediately get Worker's Faculties. And because I didn't read, I could have gotten Spaceflight Pioneers, but I just went for the level 2 stuff. Here't the order I took my Ideologues:

1. Hero of the People
2. Skyscrapers
3. Worker's Faculties
4. Socialist Realism
5. Five-Year Plan


**World Congress**

I was the founder in this game, and I never lost my Host position. The WC can potentially keep you friends with everyone, or make people hate you. I had a few allies but managed to get more when the vote starts. To maintain friendships, I gave one delegate to the other proposal, as long as it was not detrimental to me. My first proposal was World's Fair. Got that passed handily, and won it by a large margin as well. I wasted my second proposal by trying to get Sciences funding passed. That didn't work out for me (only do this if you're sure you can secure all the necessary votes in time, it can give you an extra 3-4 scientists for bulbing for an even faster victory). Next vote was for World Ideology (went for Order). At the time, I was the only one with an Ideology. This passed and civic discontent was silenced from all the other ideological pressure. After this, EVERYONE who doesn't have an ideology yet went Order. Everything after that was just repealing stuff to help my friends.

Now there are 3 talent walls associated with each individual hero. Advanced, expert and heroic. These gated talents often define builds on their own, or are just too good compared to the ones you start with. 

The talents have been jumbled around a lot, but honestly not being able to play a hero like i did before because they werent high enough level is frustrating. For example if I want to play the seige tank hero and get the level 20 talent that makes my missile ultimate repeat its course every 5 seconds, i cant do that because its gated off. Instead i get chaining on my white attacks or a 5 second rez every 120 seconds. The looping missile is great if you didnt build for team fighting as it puts your opponents on a clock essentially. 

Another example is tassadars starting talents. At base you can pick a boost to his shield ability when used on buildings/mercs or a mana regen buff based on collecting regen globes. But with talents unlocked you can get a talent that increases psistorms damage by 20%. Not only that, most of the rest of the ""psistorm dps tassadar"" talents arent gated, but to get the full use out of it you need to unlock them.

If you want to boost your income(trade value) from trade nodes build trade depots and canals. they will boost ur trade value from the province, and last also if you increase ur goods produceed u will also increase the trade value. then if you wanna take it a step furhter you can find in the tab over all nations,armies, trade and more (dont know the name for it) the value of diffrent trade goods and then you can focus on the highvalue trade goods.
one last thing is to make use of ur main tradeport, mostly usefull if u controll an endnode or several nodes after the node you want to collect from is that you should move ur mainport to asia for example so you dont have to compete with all the european powers over the trade you steer.",1,Messius,True,t3_2ce3vw,0,cjew7ea,0,1435031784,

&gt;Something like 95% of all money exists only in computers, not physical dollar bills.
&gt;Is this supposed to shock me? This would only be disturbing or surprising to a small child or a luddite.

Not to shock, was just to explain why pay so much attention to credit. When a bank makes a loan, in most cases it gives them a claim to a collateral asset (real wealth- like a mortgage is to a house or auto loan to a car) they create the money out of thin air (funny money), and collect interest on the money they created out of nothing. What is shocking is that when the Fed and banks create new money through loans [including the Fed's bond purchases], they don't create the interest. This why the monetary system requires the constant expansion of credit to create the new money to pay off the interest previously owed. Meaning that at some point, the amount interest and principal owed will far far exceed the principal only that is in existence, and that's when the financial system will completely collapse when the game of musical chairs of rotating debt pyramids comes to an end and the money to pay of the debts just simply doesn't exist. There's no way for everyone to get out of debt because then there would be no money in existence. If significant changes aren't made, Finance will eventually cannibalize the entire economy. The monetary system is the biggest cartel owned racket that ever existed.
&gt;the fed purchases of treasuries drove them higher, stock market also driven by QE and more recently market gains have been driven by share-buybacks financed through record corporate debt.
&gt;No mention whatsoever of record high non-financial corporate profits I see. That definitely has no effect on stock prices.

Not that it matters, the more horrible a company's financials the better its stock performs. The smart money in this market drove CYNK (a company with no assets, no product, no revenue, no earnings and 1 employee) up to a market cap over $5billion a couple weeks ago. 

record profits in 2012 into 2013 would have been non-existent if not for monetary expansion boosting asset prices and government deficit spending. We have declining earnings in most industries now in 2014, but record earnings per share. How you may ask? Record share-buybacks greatly reducing shares outstanding thereby greatly increasing earnings per share.

&gt;You are discussing income disparity and returns to capital; I asked why rising price inflation for luxury goods (which hurts purchasing power of the wealthy) would bother you.

High inflation in the luxury economy is the proof that the very wealthy have been the main beneficiaries of QE. If the wealthy make huge net gains from asset appreciation it, it only increases their aggregate purchasing power. Expensive luxury purchases are only a small piece of their gains. which is why I said we have high velocity of money in certain industries and assets and a sort of disinflation in others. We don't have as much basic consumer price inflation because a huge portion of the inflation is sitting in the 0.1% bank and brokerage accounts, not being spent. **You're not seeing the inflation because you're not looking in Lloyd Blankfein's and Jamie Dimon's bank account.**
&gt;These companies are huge taxpayers. If you cherry pick a 1-2 year period where they incurred massive losses and therefore didn't pay taxes (as they had no income), you are being woefully dishonest. 

Those companies weren't taking losses in 2010-2012 (the years selected in cited article), the same companies listed are still paying either no corporate tax or very little in 2013. 
http://billmoyers.com/2014/05/29/10-companies-that-dodge-corporate-taxes/

Ever heard of a Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich? These companies also get taxpayer subsidized low interest rate loans from the Import/Export Bank (who's assets aren't marked to market and would have billions in loses if they were). Megacorps get all types of government contracts, tax deductions (for campaign donations, and checks passed out to congress, all expenses of lobbying [including taking politicians out for expensive dinners] are all tax deductible), subsidies, grants, regulatory favors, etc.  
&gt;How is that fair to small business and middle class people who pay their taxes?
&gt;The vast majority of small businesses pay ZERO corporate taxes. 

sole proprietorships, partnerships, S corporations, and limited liability companies pay individual income taxes (which if they are high income earners they can be up to 39.6% at the federal level). Does a Verizon shareholder (company received subsidies and paid no US federal corporate tax) who only has to pay dividends and capital gains taxes pay a higher rate? http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/08/small-business-taxes_n_3727270.html
&gt;I do believe we should make the federal tax code more progressive to balance out the regressive nature of local/state tax codes. I also think we should radically reduce both spending and taxation. 

I agree. Bring down the corporate tax rate to around 20%, but close loopholes. Individual tax rates should be lower (for those who pay them because 43% of US population doesn't pay income tax at all), and I definitely agree with cutting government spending.
&gt;Though we disagree on many things, our political views are probably pretty well aligned.

Probably true.
&gt;Inflation subsidizes asset holders.
&gt;Inflation subsidized fixed rate debtors. High inflation is bad for both stocks and bonds. LOOK through recent history at what stock and bonds did during times of high inflation (US in the 70s for example). That is reality.

High consumer/producer price inflation/stagflation is bad for stocks/bonds. Asset price inflation great for stocks, large Fed QE treasury purchases great for bonds. Extremely high inflation is great for stocks in nominal terms but not great in real terms (see Germany 1923 where asset price inflation also manifested before significant consumer price inflation). 

&gt;Later in your comment, you discuss how inflation would torch bonds and stocks. Here you say inflation is great for assets. Which is it?

Consumer price inflation is great for Real PHYSICAL assets, not good for paper assets.

&gt;Finance does not produce real wealth, it simply allocates it, in real terms [adjusted for inflation] the stock market is a zero sum game.
&gt;My god this is crazy. The allocation of wealth creates wealth as it is a key point in the wealth creation chain. 

Finance doesn't create the wealth, it simply moves wealth around and captures wealth. The companies are the ones who produce the wealth. Does HFT, bank prop trading and derivatives create wealth? While capital allocation is necessary for wealth creation, too much of a good thing is a bad thing. At a certain point, too much resources being diverted to finance (or to the government for that matter) has a parasitic affect on the economy, where finance effectively consumes a huge portion of the wealth that the economy is producing. Monetary expansion exacerbates this problem. 
&gt;Here's the inflation adjusted S&amp;P500. Doesn't look to zero sum to me.http://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price/

What about the S&amp;P500 adjusted for monetary expansion? In order for stocks to appreciate new buyers must come into the market with new money and pay higher prices for the shares. You're confusing wealth creation with wealth transfer (a common mistake among Keynesians who also thought that rising home prices were wealth creation). The stock market is a zero sum game, it can only return what is put in. 

&gt;I gave several examples didn't just cherry pick.
&gt;Giving several examples when they are millions of goods and services IS cherry picking. That's why we have inflation indices, which all show that inflation is subdued. Why not use my corn chart that shows massive deflation? 

Inflation does not manifest itself in the same places, at the same time, at the same rate. You can have inflation in 1 industry/asset and deflation in another. Overly simplistic example: If a gold mine is discovered in Town A and people from Town B sell their house and move Town A to benefit from higher wages, then you can have asset/consumer price inflation in Town A, and deflation (in home prices for example) in Town B. Another example, in 2008 the prices of everything collapsed except for 2 industries: medical costs and college tuition costs increased.
&gt;What about oil? we're producing more oil today than in 2004 and consuming much less, if there's no inflation why isn't oil at or below the 2004 price of roughly $30/barrel.
&gt;Maybe because the US isn't the only country in the world and oil is a global commodity? Emerging market oil usage has skyrocketed while OPEC production is down.

Iraq and the rest of the world is producing much more oil now, but you're right that world oil consumption is also at record highs.  
&gt;Quasi-fixed supply with rising demand fueled by more prospective students mostly due to the echo boom (this generation is the largest of all-time) with more financing availability from the federal gov't.

I've already explained how tuition prices have gone up. What I asked you was how current prices made sense to you because until now it seemed as though you were defending current prices as if they were totally reasonable.
&gt;Furthermore not everything is a bubble. I know you guys like yelling bubble anytime something isn't grinding along half dead, but it's getting pretty annoying.

The tuition increases have been extreme in recent decades and it is the result of misallocation of capital, i just used the term bubble to emphasize this.  
&gt;I think the government is making a huge error with their student loan program

This was all that I wanted to hear from you on this subject.
&gt;Actually look at a chart of fed balance sheet/QE against 10s. Yields have risen when QE starts and dropped when QE ends for all three QE programs.

The QE programs are announced long enough before they begin. Traders ""buy the rumor and sell the news"", buying in anticipation of more treasury purchases then selling as they occur. Also the major fall in 10y rates after QE2 ended in mid 2011 coinicided with the market focusing on the development of major economic problems in Europe (which produced a spike in government bond yields in the PIIGS). Also there's the Fed's interbank loans to foreign banks which turn around and buy treasuries. And then there's Belgium http://www.hangthebankers.com/why-the-hell-is-belgium-buying-so-much-us-debt/

&gt;I don't think we'll have a recession for another 3-4 years, but yields will go down unless there is stagflation.

Recessions occur an average every 6years or so. 
&gt;deflation will do horrible things to the government's balance sheet (as they bailout and deficit spend to prop up the economy again) which won't do anything to help the US's creditworthiness long term.
&gt;Deflation is great for bonds. If you don't know this, you know ZERO about rates.

Initially it's good for high grade corporate bonds and government bonds, but if the US behaves like it did in 08' and runs huge trillion dollar deficits eventually that will end the bond bull market and cause price inflation. Running high levels of inflation is likely how the US would choose to dishonestly default on its debt. Also very high corporate default rates coincide with deflation, which aint good for bonds. http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2014-07-31/fitch-warns-high-yield-default-rate-set-jump

Also red/blue pill is a stupid distinction anyway and if I can think of something funnier I'll change it.

&gt;Over a year ago I did a reader poll where I asked readers to suggest and vote on topics they wanted to read, as you can see here. Then I seemed to forget about it. But I actually didn’t. The topic that overwhelmingly won the poll was “The stages a man goes through when he first discovers game, similar to the stages of grief.” It wasn’t even close. The problem was, I had absolutely no desire to write about that topic.

&gt;There were several reasons why I didn’t want to do that topic. Mainly, I thought it was kind of lazy. I knew the kind of article people had in mind when they suggested and voted for that topic. When the guy said “game,” I knew he had in mind those blogs that talk about pickup and “red pills” and go on and on about how the responsibility to save or destroy civilization is in their hands thanks to this superior knowledge they supposedly possess.

&gt;The piece I was expected to write would be one that would fit into the flattering narrative many readers and bloggers have invented for viewing their own lives. It would make the reader feel like a lonely truthteller, “burdened” with the enlightenment one receives after taking the “red pill” like Neo was in the Matrix. He then travels through the Five Stages of Grief the way a protagonist in a movie goes through the mythical hero’s journey, as described by Joseph Campbell in The Power of Myth.

&gt;The typical “it’s us against them” shtick. The saviors versus the villains. The enlightened versus the ignorant. The truthtelling, victimized warriors of political incorrectness versus the lying elite overlords of political correctness. The lone Byronic hero who discovers everything he believes is a lie and must now embark on his lonely, heroic quest to fight for the cause of truth against insurmountable odds, fighting an army composed of feminists, white knights, beta males, liberals, traditional conservatives, or whatever other bogeymen he concocted to feel superior to, armed only with his newfound knowledge of evolutionary psychology and his seduction skills. It’s the narrative that makes life easiest for a certain type of reader and offers the most ego protecton. It’s the narrative that makes him feel most comfortable once he plugs himself into it and makes the world make the kind of sense he wants it to make.

&gt;You may not have noticed this, but even though many of my readers seem enamored of the term, I never use the phrase “swallowed the red pill” to describe my writing. In fact, I hate the very concept and idea, and the reasons why I’ll discuss soon.
&gt;There was just so much intellectual circle-jerking and collective ego-stroking going on out there that I just didn’t want to contribute to anymore, even though I know doing so would be the far easier route. It felt like lazy pandering. I could have done the post in 10 minutes and gotten a bunch of gushing comments thanking me for being a good ego-boosting echo chamber and reaffirming the false, idealized self that a lot of readers so desperately seem to want to believe in. And then it would be utterly forgettable and instantly forgotten.

Conscripts - These units aren't the ones dealing damage, they are soaking the damage. They have 6 models: great for taking a beating and collecting dropped weapons. You can use the ppsh doc ability if you feel the need to give your conscripts an AI boost, but, in my opinion, not totally necessary. AT grenades are not meant to kill, they are meant to snag. They can destroy light vehicles, but that damaged engines lets proper AT units kill that light vehicle/tank/heavy tank.

T1 - Penals blow in 1v1s. No disagreement there. M3 can be a godsend assuming you can micro you way out of gren pfausts. And you are skipping over the sniper, a 2 man squad that is durable and can drop models in one hit.

T3 - Yeah T-34/76s assume a supporting role in this instance. They are cheap-ish, but require support in the form of AT guns, AT nades, anything that helps the T-34 get that rear armor hit.

T4 - Su-76s, we all know what it is not capable of. And it is capable of pretty much nothing. SU-85s are ok, they aren't meant to take damage. They need some sort of meat shield in order to do max damage. T34-85, M4C, and T34-76 are good options. And abuse that focus sight, it can really snipe tanks from afar.

Guards - Ambivalent on this, so I'm going to glaze over this.

Shocks - We don't need a fully dedicated AI squad to have an AT snare. That's their weakness, and you have to compensate for that.

Regarding the doctrine stuff, that's relic decision so I have really no opinion on this.

**Type**: CTF

**Map**: http://maps.jukejuice.com/save/521

**Preview**: http://i.imgur.com/LVCBWFG.png

**Design Notes**: Map is a mix of Velocity, SNES, and a bit of Star. There are four channels allowing FC a variety of options similar to Velocity. SNES influence is through the center gate although it is much less of a focus in this map. Star is evident through the side channels featuring spikes. 

Yellow boosts near spikes allow FC to quickly return to base if aimed correctly meanwhile team boosts allow for defenders to catch up and gives them the option of going through the left or right channel of spikes. Defenders can also boost across the map by using the team boost outside of gate through center. Bombs near center allow for bomb snipes if aimed correctly and also can potentially push players into spikes on the opposite side of the wall.

Base is pretty well-balanced from what users have said. Button campers can easily be pushed off by using the bomb in an accurate manner. Yellow boost in base allows for O to escape the tight confines if they have the flag or allows for O to boost into the flag and veer sharply to exit base towards a spike channel. Defense can also use the bomb to their advantage by blasting O into the gate or spikes, as well as using the button to allow FC to enter base quickly.

Only two powerups on the map as opposed to four (putting one pup in each respective base) was used as four was a bit overpowered in testing if one team was able to collect three.

Open space located in the top-right and bottom-left allows for FC the option to take chasers on and juke rather than just move between channels.

Overall for my first map I tried to make a balanced one where every potential decision allows you two (or more) options. It can be a bit chasey but by controlling center it isn't hard to chase and pin down FC either in a channel or by containing in an open space. 

Feedback is appreciated! Thanks

This is because, while other policies give modest bonuses to all your cities, Tradition gives massive bonuses to your capital *and* modest bonuses to all your cities. This means you can snowball faster and harder than any other opening. And, since pretty much everything of importance happens in the first half of the game, Tradition's big up-front boosts can put you in a winning position before the long-term potential of the other policies even starts to pay off.

Even if I'm planning to go wide, I can usually do it faster and more successfully with Tradition than Liberty. Waiting for Collective Rule before you start expanding is simply too slow, so if I'm going to build my first settler the hard way, anyway, I'd rather have free monuments and an awesome capital. In fact, if I do a hybrid start, I find that going down the right side of Liberty is way more effective than the left.

In my experience, to get much mileage out of a full Liberty tree, you pretty much have to go ICS to maximize the per city bonuses. Unfortunately, ICS was nerfed hard in BNW, so that's not really an effective plan, either.

As far as min/maxing goes, I don't really think there's any normal situation where opening with something other than Tradition is the best choice.

I've given literally gallons of blood, mostly to the local blood bank. I realize they are also a private organization, they also sell the blood, and they will also call (though they only call when they REALLY need your type). But I give blood because it's the one charitable thing I can actually do even when I'm flat broke or only have an hour to give.

I won't donate to the Red Cross. I find their marketing duplicitous, and they are extremely heavy handed with it. The final straw was when they did massive advertising to get donations for local fire victims, collected a couple hundred thousand, then used a quarter of the donations to help the locals. It left a very bad taste with me, and that impression has been reinforced several times in the last 15 years, so I still boycott them.

The whole debacle after 9/11 didn't help. Getting everyone to give blood in an attempt to circumvent the FDA on freezing, spending 2/3 of the donations the solicited for 9/11 victims on other Red Cross projects (for Katrina the number was 70%)...  and then the CONSTANTLY telemarketed me.

I think that's a gross overstatement of why people are joining guilds.  For me and most people who invest enough into this game to call it a hobby, the guild you are joining is a big deal.  Maybe a few people would have the ""only for the perks"" mindset, but I'd argue that's definitely in the minority.

&gt; All of the the guilds you get invited to within 10 seconds of making a new character only exist to level the guild and sell it, or collect on the guild level gold.

That's fine.  There's nothing that says you have to join these guilds at all.  I have honestly yet to play a game where new characters weren't spammed with guild invites.  Hell, I just jumped into FFXIV ARR on a new server the other day and within 10 minutes had 4-5 guild invites.  

If anything, building a system around guild levels will actually improve this because for the most part the higher level guilds will also be the more established guilds.  

&gt;You can still have that without a shitty skinner box thing they have now. Things like cash flow and EXP boost, or like the hearthstone cooldown are things that should be baseline for joining a guild, not the reasons you join a guild for.

Honestly, I think they should be rewards for guilds doing things as a guild.  Plenty of different routes they could go with it as well.  Everything from getting XP boosts when you are in groups with guildies (regardless of guild level) or even doing something where each week a guild quest would need to be completed in order to gain these benefits.

I had just accepted an internal move from a lead on one team to manager of another team. My new role consisted of managing a team of developers that oversaw a lot of the company's internet properties, including the main corporate one, we'll call fake.com. Fake.com was a very prominent web site back in the day, earning it a Google page rank of 10. At the time, that essentially meant that anything linked to from fake.com was seen to the Google search algorithm as completely trusted and awesome and would probably show up in the first page. 

One of the first things I did was have the test team do a complete regression test because it hadn't been done in a while and I wanted to be sure the site was in a good place. This basically meant the testers went through every page on fake.com in a bunch of different browsers to make sure everything works as expected. Around my second week into the role, I get up in the morning and there is an email from one of the testers saying he found a few odd 'invisible links' on the fake.com to a gambling site. I go look and sure enough, there are several white text on white background links to a poker site. I look in the commit logs and they looked to have been originally put there by Lead Developer Dumbass and later edited by Jr. Developer Flunkie. I check out the poker site and find that it is registered to and ran by Developer Dumbass. I call my boss and explain the situation to him and he asks what I want to do. I tell him I think they should both be fired and, personally, I wouldn't let Developer Dumbass back in the building. He says since I am so new to the role, he will handle it with HR.

I go into work later and check in with my boss. He let both of them come in, but had been waiting for them at their desks and sent them both to HR. HR does not fire either of them at this time, instead choosing to send them each home and telling them to ""take the rest of the week off"". 

Boss and HR come to me later and asks what I want to do with them. I reiterate that I think they have violated the company's trust and that they should be fired. HR hees and haws and clearly does not want to fire them, mostly because it means they'd have to find new devs and that seemed like a lot of work for what was really just a misunderstanding and I should try to ""work it out"" with them and that this would be a good test of my new management skills or some such bs. 

At this point in time, I have a friend in the IT group come and check on Developer Dumbass's computer. He admin logs in and starts poking around, almost instantly find gigs of porn, back in the day when gigs of porn took work to collect. Dig a little deeper, turns out all then code for the shitty poker site is also on the computer. Dig even deeper, we find VPN logs of the dude logging in at night to download and stream hours of porn from his work machine to his home machine, while coding on his poker site using his work machine. 

I go back to HR at this point, and they still aren't convinced.  It isn't until they call him back in on Monday and talk to him, when Developer Dumbass owns up to everything and says he was just trying to keep his marriage from falling apart because his wife kept finding his porn on their home computer, so he kept it on his work machine. 

He got another paid week off while my boss and I battled HR to get him fired, which he finally was. Jr Developer Flunkie cried his way out of it, saying he was just doing what Lead Developer Dumbass told him. As far as I know, Jr Developer Flunkie is still there and nowadays is doing middle management of some sort. 

It was around then I stopped giving a shit about the Fake corporation and started drinking. That was my 'welcome to being a grown up' in the internet industry.

&gt;Hey guys,

&gt;Just wanted to post some very quick early sketches we've done for an alternative loot beam.

&gt;We can't choose, so let us know which one you like best!! 

&gt;'Do all of them' isn't useful :p - if only we had time!

&gt;[Lootbeam Concepts](http://i.imgur.com/vFCTepA.png)

**- Update 27/06/2014**

&gt;The Ninja team are now full speed ahead with Boss Slayer!!!

&gt;For those paying attention, the two polls we had up last week are now closed. Results have determined that Death will be the representing NPC and the title unlock for killing all the bosses incorporated in Boss Slayer will be ""_ the Reaper""; which is nice as the two go quite well together.

&gt;Ana put some quick concepts for a new lootbeam (see above) on the forums, twitter, and reddit. We've kept an eye on what people have said, and it would appear a majority thought that the rainbow was the best. As such, this will be an unlockable reward through Boss Slayer.

&gt;Labl has started work on Death's office, the place you'll be going to receive your daily Boss Slayer task. Below is an early work in progress model of the area:

&gt;[Death's Office](http://i.imgur.com/w3WFNGo.png)

&gt;*(everything is still greybox so it is subject to change)*

&gt;Asherz has been working on a new interface which will display all the bosses available in Boss Slayer with total kills, fastest kill, available drops, as well as some other information. You'll also be able to see a variety of other monster kill counts on the interface as well.

&gt;That's all for this week... You stay classy Gielinor!

**- Update 04/07/2014**

&gt;This week we've made a bit of a change to the face of the project. Now that Death has been voted in as the representing NPC, we decided to theme it a bit more around him and not so much existing Slayer.

&gt;Don’t worry, this won't change anything that we currently have planned, it just means instead of being **assigned** something, you're told to **reap** them instead. The implication being that you collect the souls of the monsters you kill for Death. This is something we're pretty excited about, it made sense to make the change, giving the content much more depth and context in game.

&gt;We mentioned before that we were going to be putting out a pre-release for this project which consisted of boss and monster kill tracking, as well as instanced boss kill timers. Asherz has been working away at getting this sorted as quick as he can so it can be put into game ASAP. This will give you a nice little head start at killing bosses, not only for practice but also towards some of the unlockable rewards going out with the main release a few weeks later.

&gt;Labl is still working away at the 3D environment for Death's office, and it's starting to look hawt! What do you think of this work in progress?

&gt;[Death's Office](http://i.imgur.com/JV3IuSd.png)

&gt;*(currently using Death's old model as a placeholder - also, Roddeck army not included)*

&gt;Ana has been putting some concepts together for one of the rewards that we haven't mentioned yet. I think we'll keep this one up our sleeves for a little while longer as it's pretty darn juicy. 

&gt;Stu O has managed to get his claws on a new Kalphite Queen model which he’s now bringing to life with some fresh animations. We’ll be adding this to our main release as a nice little booster. Again, let us know you think.

&gt;[New Kalphite Queen Model](http://imgur.com/a/ZrY19)

&gt;Finally, we've seen a few people asking for an ETA for this update. We're currently looking to have the pre-release ready to go out towards the end of this month and the actual release should be around the middle of August. This can obviously change but they're our expected release times for those that wanted to know. Quite annoying having to wait but it should definitely be worth it. 


**- Update 14/07/2014**

&gt;The team have been continuing with what was mentioned in the last update; Stu O animating the Kalphite Queen, Labl on the 3D environment for Death's Office, leaving Ana and Asherz on the content side of the pre-release.

&gt;As previously mentioned the pre-release should be with you in the next few weeks; here is what we'll be putting out:

&gt;* **Boss Timers** - these are basically stopwatches which you can view during boss fights. They will only appear in instanced fights with a set group size selected, depending on the boss. When the main release comes out you will be able to view your personal best times for each boss.
* **Boss Kill Tracking** - this will track your boss kills in the background, but you won't be able to see how many until the main release comes out.
* **Slayer Monster Tracking** - the same as boss kill tracking but for a select group of slayer creatures that we were able to fit into the update. More creatures may be able to be tracked later, see our current list in the picture below.

&gt;For the Completionists out there, and those aiming for it, here are the new requirements that we're looking to add with the main updates release:

&gt;* **Completionist** - Kill all bosses to unlock ""_ the Reaper"" title, which will be lost whenever a new boss comes out. All the current bosses are bullet-pointed in the update made on 19/06/2014 on the first post of this thread.
* **Trimmed Completionist** - Unlock all permanent rewards through Boss Slayer. This is a time trial more than anything else, I guess depending on how good you are at bossing will determine how quickly you'll be able to complete this requirement.

&gt;*Note: as kills are tracked with the pre-release, players can work towards the Completionist unlock from that update. Bosses killed before this update will not count towards the achievement. However, we do have existing achievements in-game which will allow us to give players one kill on certain bosses (Barrows &amp; Rots, Fight Caves, Fight Kiln, all GWD, QBD and Vorago including Hardmode) when the pre-release goes live.* 

&gt;Finally, we know you like looking at a few pictures so here are some more sneak peeks from the main release:

&gt;[Death's Office](http://i.imgur.com/TG0OJxB.jpg)

&gt;*Starting to come together really nicely but still a bit off completion, says Labl*


&gt;[Slayer Creatures](http://i.imgur.com/wf5soRQ.png)

&gt;*No kills = #noob*


&gt;[Incomplete Hydrix](http://i.imgur.com/cs7Keh3.png)

&gt;*...and what could this be?*

**- Update 22/07/2014**

&gt;The pre-release for Boss Slayer is now live!

&gt;We hope you enjoy the new timers and the comfort of knowing that your boss and creature kills are now being tracked. These features will hopefully create some healthy competition between players and we'll no doubt be developing some seasonal hiscores with them in mind in the not too distant future. 

&gt;With this now in the game you'll be able to start working towards some of the rewards that come with the main Boss Slayer update. For those aiming for the previously mentioned Completionist requirements, you'll now be able to do so. With the main release you’ll be able to see the information we’re now tracking in a new pane created by Asherz which will appear within the Adventurers interface. 

&gt;We've also done our best to backtrack whether some of the bosses have already been killed by players based on the data we had stored. If we could prove that a player had killed a boss at least once we gave them a kill, which we thought would help those that wouldn't want to replay a particular boss. Here is a list of the bosses we've backtracked and the requirement to be given a kill:

&gt;* **Barrows** - Checks if the player has obtained the Barrows icon during the Temple of Senntisten quest.
* **Barrows: Rise of the Six** - Checks that Barrows: Rise of the Six has been completed.
* **Commander Zilyana** - Checks if the player has obtained the Saradomin lore book.
* **General Graardor** - Checks if the player has obtained the Bandos lore book.
* **Har-aken** - Completion of the Fight Kiln.
* **Kree'arra** - Checks if the player has obtained the Armadyl lore book.
* **K'ril Tsutsaroth** - Checks if the player has obtained the Zamorak lore book.
* **Nex** - Checks if the player has obtained the Nex lore book.
* **Queen Black Dragon** - Obtained the first Dragonkin journal.
* **TzTok-Jad** - Completion of the Fight Caves, or sacrificed a fire cape.
* **Vorago** - Checks that Vorago has been mauled personally.
* **Vorago (Hardmode)** - Checks if the player has unlocked '_ the Defeater' title.


&gt;Now for an exclusive! Here's a cosmetic override set that you'll be able to earn piece-by-piece for killing certain amounts of bosses. Let me just warn you, this won't be easy to obtain, only those that are true masters of PvM will be able to unlock it. Ana has done an awesome job in the concept, tying in elements from the bosses of Gielinor into one truly epic outfit. What do you think?

&gt;[Boss Slayer Reward Outfit](http://i.imgur.com/kHcbW8f.jpg)

&gt;Also on the development side of things, Labl has now finished Death's office! No picture this time as we want the final form to be a surprise on release. You'll be able to travel to this area through a portal in Draynor, right next to the lodestone for easy access. Labls next challenge will be to model the remaining reward items, including the outfit above, expect to see development on this in the coming weeks.

&gt;-Black Temple and Frostwolf keep no longer hub cities, just quest locations you visit once.

This is right and blizzard has told us nothing to make us think otherwise if they were to be used as a future scenario or something and even if they were we won't give a shit becasue we wont be invested in the city's like we would be if it was say a massive iron horde invasion that we fight back a few NPC deaths here and there of NPC's that are interesting and cool would make me so pissed at the iron horde. But instead we get ""there are some draenei you never got to speak to becasue you never spent anytime here becasue there was no point in spending anytime here died in that assault."" and we all let out a collective ""Meh""

&gt;-New faction cities are copy pastes of the 4.1 krasarang wilds faction bases in ashran, an island in nowhere

Whilst not true I think the point he wanted to get through was ""Yay generic alliance / horde camp_004"" And I feel the same.

&gt;-Garrisons only in one zone now, no longer customization, no longer lets you name npcs, no longer has skill boosts, is just a daily quest hub phased to you.

There is no customization for garrisons anymore other than choose where the buildings go and talking to people from the beta they have said it really does just feel like a quest hub mixed with the panda farm. The other two comments I have not looked into.

&gt;-average class goes from 40 spells to 7

Wrong.

&gt;-no new skeletons or animations, literally every creature in the expansion is a remodelled creature.

No idea but I would hope he is wrong.

&gt;-portions of entire zones are copy pasted from the BC devset

Wrong.

&gt;-the rest are not flying compatible and have 2d jpg mountains now you know why shamans had far sight and hunters had eagle vision removed.

I can imagine they bothered fully modeling any of the stuff we wont be able to get too seeing as its more and more likely every day that flying just wont happen this xpac. So its speculation but one based in common sense.

&gt;-now only 4 dungeons from level 90-100

Think they already said they would be doing normal and heroic of all the dungeons. 

&gt;-client code for garrison cash shop functionality discovered, quickly removed along with tweet mentioning it from cory stockton

Haven't heard anything about this and whilst it sounds like something blizzard would do I think this guy is just blowing smoke out his ass. 

&gt;-less raid content at launch than any expansion

I actually just thought about this and I know nothing about the raids we will be getting in WoD like at all. All I want is them to bring back interesting raids and wing based raids similar to naxx and ulduar rather than this SoO straight line of bosses. 

&gt;-less dungeons than cataclysm had in PATCHES

6 with 1 remade dungeon does suck a bit they better be the most amazing dungeons iv ever done. 

&gt;-no flying

Well yeah... they said that very early on. 

&gt;-story is a barely canon side timeline alternate dimension just to give another enemy to fight while trying to lure in veterans with nostalgia and a 'veterans first!"" beta access program

I too am worried that this will become a ""And it was all just a dream"" expansion.

&gt;-almost all CC removed in pvp. totally removed in pve

Whilst correct this seems like a good change as long as they keep heals under control.

&gt;-adding healing and tanking npcs in quests

Sounds good

&gt;-Heirloom and tabard storage tab just cut until ""later""

Yeah it really sucks along with the Tmog tab coming later I currently have so much Tmog stuff that its now flowing over into my bags leaving me with at most 3 open bag slots. 

&gt;-replacing quests with ""dynamic, interactive world experiences"" that appear once and when you do them disappear leaving huge swathes of zones empty.

I assume blowing smoke again about them disappearing after having done them once.

&gt;-new models have a single face and the cosmetic choices in almost every model but undead simply adds a new texture to said single face.

Wrong.

&gt;-homogenized healing to the point that its all just different colours now

I also dislike the way healing is going taking away each healers individual best roles and uniqueness although its probably healthier for the ""don't bother with raid comp"" game play blizzard are moving towards.

&gt;-guild levleing removed

Yup

&gt;-talents auto fill per spec to avoid confusion.

Sounds dumb but easy enough to change.

&gt;-80% of announcements from blizzcon for the expansion are confirmed cut or extremely truncated in some way.

Whilst maybe not 80% we have seen a massive amount of content that was announced cut or just not live up to what we were told it would be (looking at you ashran and capital camps)

0,,t1_cjdv81q,1,1406891720,,t1_cjduaj3,1406892197,wow,False,hunter,t5_2qio8,"Public Quests (PQs) are a type of quest found in certain MMORPGs.  Whereas a typical MMO quest involves the player talking to a quest giver, completing objectives, then turning it in for a reward,  in a public quest the player will enter a certain area, automatically take on the public quest, and work with other players in the area to complete the PQ.  Public Quests allow for players to join in group PvE without traditional grouping mechanics - all players are working together regardless of whether they are in the same group or not. A typical PQ in Warhammer Online would involve defeating a large number of normal mobs, then a small number of harder heroic mobs, then finally defeating a boss which would require multiple groups of players to work together, though there are many variations.  

After a public quest is completed, those who contributed to the tasks have an opportunity to receive a reward in the form of one of a limited number of loot bags. Each bag contains a selection of items usable by the character that wins it, including coin, crafting components, and class-specific equipment. A single item may be selected from a loot bag, and the selection of items available varies based on the rarity of the bag itself.

In order to determine who receives the available loot bags, a number is randomly generated for each player that contributed to the public quest. Modifiers are then added to the roll based on the contribution of the player to the success of the objectives. This means that even though those who contribute most to a public quest receive an increased chance at being awarded a loot bag, anyone that was involved in the quest stands a chance at earning a reward. The players that receive the largest numbers, after modifiers are applied, are allowed to claim the loot bags. Participants not winning a bag can wait for the public quest to reset, complete again and will be granted an additional modifier applied to their rolls to boost chances of winning a bag.

its got a ways to go, but its surviving, and its getting there, to put it simply.

let me get this out of the way first. ESO is a bad, bad elder scrolls game. plain and simple. it offers almost none of the sandbox design that we are used to in the single player games, it is also a very bad MMO, because of the lack of focus on social interaction. it IS however a very very good and fun MMO/elder scrolls hybrid, because of the journey it takes you on while also giving you the option to experience that journey in a world filled with other people to talk to, trade with, and delve with. the writing, art style, and sound is all just fantastic, and the only thing letting it down at the moment is the endgame and the Veteran rank grind.

now, zenimax online might be one of the most awesome dev teams I've come across, because since launch they have been listening to and chatting with the community on what they dislike, and would want in the game and they have some pretty exciting stuff in the works that should fix all the main gripes about the current game. 

first of all is the champion system, which is going to be a complete overhaul of the veteran rank system by changing the way you level ranks after 50. mainly you will earn champion points in the place of exp, and you will gain a boost to the rate at which you earn these points if you have been offline for a while. this is good opposed to the current system because getting to max VR was a terrible grind that a lot of people just couldn't finish.

secondly there is new adventure zones/solo zones, adventure zones being large group focused PVE zones with raids and lots of group content, and the solo zones for people who just want to enjoy PVE by themselves. one adventure zone has been added since launch so far, and one adventure zone and one solo zone have been announced for release in the near future.

thirdly is the imperial city update. this is where they are going to open up the imperial city as a PVP/PVE zone which is slap bang in the middle of the PVP zone to all three factions. its supposed to be a lot like darkness falls from DAoC.

also being added early august is update 3, which introduces the [armour dye system](http://files.elderscrollsonline.com/uploads/blogs/65b875bd0dfe4004d8c5bfd09af1c88d.jpg), guild tabards and guild stores across tamriel

then there is Bounty hunting and the justice system. this is the feature im looking forward to most by far. basically when this is introduced (no planned release but its in the works) players will be able to steal from and kill NPC's and Guards ala the single player games, doing so will result in you getting slapped with a bounty which increases as you get into more trouble. you can either pay off the fine or fight off the guards and run, but if you decide to run than other players can come and kill you anywhere in the world to collect your bounty! I think this is a very good solution for people who want open world pvp and people who don't. 

then there are various other things, like armour, dark brotherhood and thieves guild being added as well, along with various other large animation, graphics and mechanic related updates and tweaks.

while I understand its the ""cool"" thing to do by hating this game without even looking into it much its actually a pretty good game and is being constantly improved. not to mention that I heard about a report a bit ago that the game still had like 700,000-900,000 subs, which coupled with the fact that the dev team vowed to shut down the game before they go F2P means the game might actually survive long enough to see a major turn around.

**TLDR: terrible TES game, terrible MMO, extremely good hybrid. upcoming content includes; extensive dye system, open world pvp bounty hunting and justice system, thieves guild, dark brother hood, imperial city PVP/PVE zone, adventure zones, solo zones. a crap tonne more that I can't remember off the top of my head**",25,thatguythatdidstuff,True,t3_2caufh,0,cjdtqz8,0,1435012943,

You can have as much fun as a novice as you can as a grand master and no mater how good you think you are you can still be humbled by any deck with a good swing.

As I got older I sold my cards and began playing only rarely when I visited my friends. We would play with the same old tired horrible decks just as Alison's friends had. Those days it was more about making what you drew work rather then having a deck that was aligned from construction for absolute victory. Half the time I didn't even know what was inside the deck and a cheeky play would as much fun for both of us. This was how I gained my first Ornithopter victory.

I have only recently returned to buying my own magic cards now that I have the money to seriously play. This time around it is a different experience then buying in my youth. Now its about opening boosters and finding that card you where hoping to get, its about seeing a card and envisioning it as the base of some new killer deck strategy, its about collecting and looking at all that sexy artwork. 

In my short return I have probably collected more cards then it is fair for any one person to own. I may even need to seek help as I'm absolutely addicted to opening booster boxes ;P 


Magic is so successful became it so easily folds into how you play, what you can afford to pay, how much effort and time you want or can invest in it. Magic has the unique knack of being exactly what you want it to become. After playing magic for 20 years I am still amazed at how it never feels old and tired. There is always new themes, always new mechanics, and always new decks to make. It's outlived every other game because its a new game every time I shuffle my deck. If what I have gets boring, I break down the deck and build something new.

What /u/rex8499 described *could* be implemented on a series hybrid system, you would essentially add a turbocharger to the internal combustion engine. Then, rather than using the turbo to spin a compressor to feed more air to the engine, you would replace the compressor with a generator and use the turbine to collect some of the energy that otherwise would have been sent out the exhaust and wasted.

The Formula 1 hybrid implementation is unique though. There's still an internal combustion engine driving the wheels. There's a turbocharger, and it still turns a compressor that feeds the engine. The difference is that the turbocharger in F1 cars now also turns a generator, so it's gathering excess energy from the exhaust and sending it to a really fancy battery and control system. They call this the MGU-H or ""Motor Generator Unit - Heat"" because it's collecting energy that otherwise would be wasted as hot exhaust gas. The MGU-H can also be used as a motor to keep the turbocharger spooled up so it can provide its maximum boost to the engine on acceleration immediately after braking.

The F1 cars have another system called the MGU-K or ""Motor Generator Unit - Kinetic"" which is essentially a motor connected to the crank shaft of the engine. This motor can draw on the collected energy in the battery to supply up to 160 additional hp on top of what the engine already produces, and it sends it to the wheels via the transmission. The MGU-K can also perform regenerative braking like the Toyota Prius, wherein the flow of electricity to the MGU-K motor is reversed and it acts like a generator. It takes the kinetic energy of the moving car and turns it back into electricity and sends it into the battery to be used again later. Drawing this energy from the driveline applies resistance to the wheels, so in addition to generating electricity, it also slows the car down.",3,odichthys,True,t3_2c8p7e,0,cjdgvqe,0,1435006480,
0,,t1_cjdetk8,2,1406843350,,t1_cjd77nr,False,AskEngineers,False,,t5_2sebk,"&gt; Or I thought, why not have a turbocharger on a hybrid car that collects that waste energy in the exhaust, runs a small generator instead of a compressor, and charges the battery for the hybrid motor. Could get quite a bit more power out of that. Looked into it...already patented. But no manufacturer has built one like that. I thought it was a good idea.

You described the ""MGU-H"" system that all formula one cars have, most LMP cars and now stuff like the McLaren P1, Porsche 918, La Ferrari and I'm half sure the BMW i8 uses it too.

Added bonus of using the MGU to spool the turbo too, to maintain constant boost pressure thus eliminating turbo-lag",2,[deleted],True,t3_2c8p7e,0,cjdetk8,0,1435005448,

EDIT: Forgot to give advice! I untied the HRE as Brandenburg to Prussia, so it may be a little different for you.

1. I kept several stacks of 36 (20-5-10). When I could siege multiple provinces I could split into two 18 stacks without much trouble. I'm at the point where I have so much money I don't know what to do with it, so I have close to 300k troops. I keep them in different ""theaters"" (Ottoman, Russian, French, and Scandinavian). I still have not fully united, so I let my vassals do most of the sieging while I wipe their large stacks of troops.

2. What is your home node? You have a lot of different choices, but I would recommend Antwerpen or Lubeck. Since you control a majority of those provinces, you want to ""feed"" them by placing light ships and merchants to direct trade there. The more trade power you have, the more money that flows/is collected in your home province. For me, my Home node is Lubeck, and to have the most Trade Power I have the majority of my light ships patrolling it, with a bit less patrolling the Baltic sea, and very few patrolling Novgorod

3. You're still early in the game, which is awesome! Basically you have to break them apart little by little. Have large nations release small nations and either diplo-annex them (you get a significant boost to Diplomacy for releasing countries), or wait until a treaty runs out and annex them",2,WorldOneWon,True,t3_2c9lg9,0,cjdcph4,0,1434997408,

And it's also one of the easiest to completely break if you know how - and one of the easiest to get wrong if you don't learn the game systems. I had a friend who didn't even know you could junction GFs! He made it all the way to the end of disc 2 using only the Attack command, crazy.

How much do you mind spoilers? If you don't mind reading GameFAQs you can completely break the game with a bit of effort and kill most bosses in four or five turns. If you don't want to do that, you can still use some of these tips and get results.

1. Never cast magic, ever. There are a few exceptions to this (Aura and Meltdown are ok, for example, on bosses). This is because magic is much more useful junctioned to your characters' stats. You will spend a lot of turns in this game using Attack.

2. Normal enemies level with you all the way to 100, so there's a good reason to stay low level (bosses have a level cap they can't go over). Don't fight random battles unless you really need to. Running away is fine. The Card ability stops you getting exp from enemies you have to fight. One additional reason to stay low level - late in the game you can get access to Stat Bonus abilities, that give you +1 to a stat when you level up. If you're low level when you get to that stage, you have more opportunities to use the Bonus ability. You don't need to do this to beat the game, though.

3. Putting both these things together, the game can be made into total easy mode if you stay low level and then use high-level magic to boost your stats. Enemies stay low level and you smash them with absurdly powerful characters. There are a few ways to obtain high-level magic earlier than you should:

	\- Draw it from enemies, especially bosses. Most bosses in the game will have a spell you haven't got, and you should draw at least 100 of them; 300 is better but takes a lot of patience. These are things like Esuna, Regen, Full-Life, Tornado, Triple, Quake, the list goes on. The number of spells drawn by the Draw command is determined by the spell's power and the character's magic, so make good mag-junctions a priority and consider using Mag+% abilities if you're on a drawing binge.

	\- Use refine abilities. Your GFs can learn abilities to turn junk into magic. Some of this magic is very useful. Shiva's Ice Magic Refine ability can turn Fish Fins that drop from the fish guys on the beach outside Balamb into 20 Water spells, which are pretty good early on. You can experiment with this, or just look up what items are good.

	\- Use the Card ability to turn enemies into cards. Sounds dumb, but there's an ability to turn cards into junk, and then you can turn that junk into spells. This is a pretty good way to break the game, because there are some early enemies whose cards refine into very good spells. They're also good for playing the card game...

	\- Play the card game a lot. This will SERIOUSLY break the game if you get good at the game and put some effort in collecting good cards. Maybe save this one for your second playthrough, as it takes time and you'll breeze through every battle if you do it right. You can for example get 300 Tornado spells before you leave Balamb Garden, which is probably one of the top 3 spells to junction onto strength in the game. You will three-shot bosses with this method.

4. The card game can also be abused in other ways. You can get Kiros' card before you finish Disc 1, for example, which refines into 3 items that teach a GF Auto-Haste. One per character, you now have permanent Haste for the rest of the game. Again you can look this stuff up or just have fun working it out on your own.

5. Remember to draw GFs from the bosses that have them! I can't stress this enough because you can't get them again until the final dungeon and the game is MUCH harder without them (less GFs, less junction abilities, less opportunities to break the game with absurd junctions). Do NOT forget, again look it up if you're worried you'll forget. Also, save and use the magic lamp Cid gives you right after you get it. See #2 for the reason why.

6. You can use limit breaks any time as long as your HP is yellow. Just keep pressing the pass-turn button until the limit break option appears. Keeping your characters at low health purely to abuse their limit breaks is a valid strategy. Renzokuken is very good at killing those fish guys on the beach for example.

7. The Tomb of the Unknown King is good for more than the code to get into Caraway's house if you do a bit of exploring and can handle the battles, too.

8. You can take tests in the Tutorial part of the menu to level up as a SeeD, which will increase your pay. You can take one test per level on Squall, and each test gives one SeeD rank. Do these every time you level for more cash.

8. If you press the trigger button (R1 on PS) when Squall hits the enemy with his gunblade, he crits. You can get a crit every time with him with some practice.

9. One final thing - the Boost command confuses some people. I don't know the controls on the PC but on PS you hold select while a GF is summoning and then mash square when you're told to. The number that goes up is the % damage the GF will do.

In addition to this general stuff, there are lots of specific tactics for certain bits of the game [(eg. when Squall is with Quistis in the training centre, you can draw 100 Sleeps from Grats and put them on his status-attack, which you should have if you drew the GF Siren. Many other enemies in the area are weak against sleep. They also have Blind, which is very useful against some bosses later on.)](/spoiler) but you can probably get those online if you're interested, they're pretty spoilery.

I am 40 and I'm not going to say that I'm the hardest working man in the world, but when you ask somebody to clean the windows and they quit half way through their first window, you can say that individual has a major flaw, but when you have person after person under the age of 30 (typically) show up late, put in no effort, leave early, over and over, there has to be something systemic. When taken aside, they genuinely think they are special and are hard working. Kids aren't put to the test when young and don't know how to cope during adulthood. Parents are so concerned with being their kid's pal and maintaining their self esteem that they don't teach them to fend for themselves. You didn't do well in school or on the field, that's OK, you tried hard and are so great! Yes, a boost is necessary at times but you also need to let the sting of failing set in, let the kid realize that it sucks so they try harder next time, but that seems to have been taken away. The amount of adults still living with their parents is a great sign of that. It won't take long to find a 26 year old on reddit that lives with mom and dad, and very likely was never on their own. ""It's hard out there..."" No shit, that isn't a new phenomenon. I've had 3 jobs at the same time and my wife did the same so we could make ends meet. Yes, lots of people do that still, but a *lot* of people will not even have that cross their minds. I'll just collect this or that from the government and/or stay with mom and dad. It's such a widespread thing, that I can't help but think that the way my generation ultra coddled their kids is a major factor in this.

Yes, there are lazy SOBs in every demographic there is, but finding a person 30 or under that will actually break a sweat is fewer and farther in between.

0,Colonial governor,t1_cjd55lu,2,1406826194,,t1_cjd4vtc,False,eu4,False,,t5_2uqat,"The best way to test this is just take like half of your trade fleet and send it to ming. You definitely want to keep a high trade power in the your collection node, but you get diminishing returns after a point. (Your ships are worth less of a percentage of the trade node, the more you add, as you're also increasing the total trade power.)

So for example, with really simple numbers. Lets say your Home node is worth 10 ducats, and you're collecting 70%, that's 7 ducats a month profit. 

Now, if you send half of your trade fleet to ming, which, reduces your home node percentage to 65%, meaning you're only making 6.5 now. But, if Ming is also worth 10 ducats a month, and your half of a trade fleet increases your control by 10% there, meaning you're sending an extra ducat to your home node, which you collect 65% of, means you're now making .65 ducats for those same ships. An increase of .15 ducats!!*

This obviously scales to be much larger numbers, especially when you account for being able to snag portions of a bunch of different nodes. But that's pretty much how that works. Really the best thing to do, is to just send parts of your fleet different places, wait for the month to tick over, see what your trade value is, and then either keep it, or try a different layout.

** You also need to account for the fact that, especially as trading nations, you may have bonuses to various things. Like, having a merchant in your home nodes boosts the value you collect by 10%, the trade node detail will break out what you're collecting, and what you actually take home. There's other bonuses that add to that too. But conversely, there's also the trade steering bonuses. Which may make your ships more powerful abroad than they are at home. It's all a balancing act.

* 2: War Cry-charge rune or impunity rune
* 3: Battle Cry-bloodshed rune or marauder's rage rune (Bloodshed preferred)
* 4: Wrath of the Berserker-insanity rune

passives: Unforgiving, Superstition, Rampage, Bloodthirst

stats to gear for:
strength(str), critical hit chance(cc), critical hit damage(cd), element of choice(fire with the example build above), all resistance(ar), vitality(vit), elite damage(from aughilds or sun keeper), and main skill damage(+15% hota dmg for instance).

* belt: str, ar, vit, +% life
* pants: str, 2 sockets, and 2 of ar/vit/+% life
* boots: str, ar, and 2 of vit/movement speed/skill dmg (lot of boots have movement speed, but it's better to get the 25% cap with paragon levels)
* weapons: str, socket with best emerald you can afford, other (dual wield is generally much better than 2h, but it'll be getting *much* better in 2.1 so keep a lookout for high dmg 2handers and something like Maximus or The Furnace-if they don't nerf it)

Try to get health globe bonus to boost Bloodthirst for life per fury spent(lpfs).

Another thing, for Paragon points:

* You'll want to max movement speed first, then since you have Reaper's(recraft for better stats though) you'll want to max the fury, then whatever is left in str.
* Crit chance and crit dmg, CDR and IAS are less important right now.
* AR, then %life or %armor
* Area dmg, then RCR, then whatever

Your Haunt of Vaxo is good. It's expensive to enchant jewelery(and the gems can be tough to get in bulk), but eventually you should consider rerolling the vit to an element of your choice(that you use or plan to use), roll the vit to a socket(for 2.1 legendary gems), or roll the crit dmg to 80%+. Rerolling vit would be better. Keep in mind the proc on HOV needs a consistent stun, which I see you don't have in your build. Ground Stomp would serve well here. You could craft a bunch of rare amulets(4 marquise gems and 10k) at the jeweler artisan in the meantime to get something with 3-4/4 stats I posted so you can enchant for the 4th or keep going with HOV and Ground Stomp, the clones do decent damage that scales with you.

A couple good crafting sets, if you've gotten the plans of course, are Aughild's and Asheara's. Some others, but you're just starting out. Devastator is a good fire damage weapon you can craft, and Reaper's Wraps is a very good bracers for multiple classes you can craft.

Do bounties for act1 caches to try and get Ring of Royal Grandeur(RORG) to stack set bonuses from multiple sets. Can be a grind, but it's worth it for this. (You might also get a good amulet, Golden Gorget of Leoric, with similar stats I posted, or a Mad Monarch's Scepter which is a decent weapon when you're starting out.)

Some items to hope for are Cindercoat, Stone of Jordan, Burning Axe of Sankis, and Sun Keeper. And the barbarian sets, particularly Might of the Earth(together with Lut Socks), and Raekor's Burden(for patch 2.1). The cooldown reduction stat(CDR) is good for these sets. Immortal King's set is good for the lower difficulties, but will be getting nerfed somewhat in 2.1 unless they change some things, though it's still very good as an intermediate set right now. Lots of other items to keep a lookout for. Always ask about items you find on here so you don't unknowingly salvage something good.

Fire is your best bet as a newbie, but collect gear for lightning, physical and cold as blizzard continues to buff those elements. (mostly in 2.1)

So clearly maximizing affection isn't the only goal, and meaningful relationship is somewhat redefined from what the norm is in the modern era.

There are plenty of perfectly happy polyamorous or 3+ person relationships in the world. Obviously it's not going to be a normal 2 person relationship (unless you only pick 1 waifu), but you can still easily maintain a happy, loving relationship with multiple waifus simultaneously, provided you aren't stretching yourself too thin or playing favorites. 

That said, not only are you picking *35* women, you're also basing your powers on having sex with 5 of them a day, every day, in a rotation. They've become little more than objects or appointments to keep at that point. Even if you devoted 100% of your waking hours (let's say you get 8 hours of sleep a day, and have to devote 2 to eating, bathing, resting, etc, giving you 14 hours to work with) to spending time with your harem, they get 2 hours and 48 minutes with you. *A week*.

I'd have to get to know them to find good reasons to care for them. I avoided any personalities I thought would be especially objectionable to me.

You won't even be able to get to know them with how little time with each you're going to have. 

&gt;Without the magical boosts it would be somewhat hard to maintain a meaningful relationship. If I gained the powers independently and thus was able to provide all with a good experience I'd still enjoy a similar number and variety

""Without the boosts I wouldn't be able to keep the sex up for that long, so it's okay since having sex with all of them gives me the boosts.""
This would be fine if all everyone wanted was sex. But they don't. I'm asking if you would still keep around all of these women if they gave only companionship, and not any power. Would you still keep them all around, and try to make them all feel loved and wanted, despite the fact that there's no way in hell you could with how many there are?

This would all probably work better if you had Priest. That one seems to be geared around large harems, since they form a cult around you and worship you.

You are an average citizen living in the city of Spisani, an Ancostian costal city about fifty miles south of the capital, Haeliana. It’s population is around a hundred thousand (which makes Spisani one of the larger cities of the Tutonian Empire), but that aside it’s a fairly average city.

Your day starts early. It’s still dark when you wake up, through your open window only a few streaks of pink visible in the sky. Despite this the city is already coming to life, evidenced by the noise of the streets below. Doubtless it would prevent most from sleeping, but you barely even notice it.

You’re careful not to wake your family as you dress, quietly pulling on a grey linen tunic and open-faced leather shoes. You quickly eat a hunk of cold bread, washing it down with water from a carafe your wife filled yesterday. Grabbing the empty wineskin off the table you fill it mostly with water, adding about a quarter’s worth of wine. You’ll sip this heavily-watered wine to give you that little boost of energy we all need to get through the day. By the time you start feeling the effects of the wine, you’ll be back home and ready for bed. You slip on a small satchel, putting in it the wineskin and a small bronze token. Kissing your wife goodbye, you head out the door.

You and your family live on the fourth floor of a cramped and noisy five-story tenement building, [looking something like this] (http://classconnection.s3.amazonaws.com/739/flashcards/613123/jpg/picture74.jpg).  Only the very wealthy have their own homes inside the city, most of Spisani’s inhabitants, even ones of middling wealth, live in such apartment blocks. Typically, ground floor units are shops, while the remaining floors are private residences, which individuals rent from the building’s owner. Lower floor rooms are the most desirable. They are spacious and offer amenities like plumbing, running water, and central heating. The higher the floor, the shoddier the construction and the fewer the amenities. The one room you and your family cram into is cold in the winter and hot in the summer, with little ventilation and light coming only from a small window (candles and lamps are banned by civic authorities for fear of fire). These buildings are loud, crowded, and filthy. City life is very public- the tenements afford little privacy.

Your building is owned by one of Spisani’s wealthy elites. The property is a lucrative investment for him- rents are high, the small room you live in costs around 10 to 15 silver *talens* each month (roughly ten to fifteen days wages), with lower floor rooms costing much more. Most building owners care little for their poorer occupants. Upper floors are usually built of wood rather then brick, with collapses and fires common. Your sister was killed in such a collapse when you were younger. All it takes is one missed rent payment for the owner to put you out on the street. Even so, you consider yourself lucky to have a roof over your head. The alternative is far worse, after all.

You head off down the street, with a few stops to make before going to your current work. Dawn’s beginning to break, with streaks of red light visible over the tiled roofs of the tenements. Like most Tutonian cities, Spisani is built on a grid, so it’s easy to navigate, even though you know the street names by heart. The din grows louder as the city comes to life. Shop owners are already haggling and hawking their wears, you hear heated arguments coming from an advocate’s office. Tutonian is the language of the street, but you hear voices in Gaulanite, Xraxosi, and Numanthian as well. The smell of fresh bread and honeyed pastries is everywhere. Spisani is famous throughout the Empire for it’s honey cakes and other fruit pastries. It’s also the nexus of the tea trade, the waterfront is lined with warehouses full of it. There’s a fortune to be made in the expensive Gaulanite drink, which is extremely popular with the Empire’s elite. You personally don’t get why they love it- to you it tastes like stale dirt. 

You dodge a woman empting a chamber part from an upper-story window, savagely cursing as the piss splatters onto your tunic. Although there are public toilets attached to many tenement buildings that drain directly into the excellent sewage system, most people are not going to descent multiple flights of stairs every time they have to take a piss.  Chamber pots are therefore a necessity, and, keeping the stairs thing in mind, its much easer to just toss the contents out a window. As we can imagine, disease is a problem.

You finally reach the city center, a great public square lined with colonnaded halls filled with shops. Some are public buildings too, where the aristocratic council that governs Spisani meets and where the magistrates sit, administering and dispensing justice. The law courts are also here; you make a brief detour to see if anyone prominent is on the docket. A good court case is always entertaining. But the main reason you are here is to collect your free grain ration.

In the capital of Haeliana, the king provides free grain to the city’s poorest citizens, paid for from the privy purse. This practice is replicated in many of the Empire’s cities, funded by local elites as a way of demonstrating their magnanimity, and out of a desire for peoples’ votes during city elections. Already a line is forming, even though you tried to get here early. When it’s your turn, you hand over that bronze token to a clerk, who checks it against a ledger then gives you a small portion of grain and some olive oil. Only you can collect it- the token is issued to you, and the food given is designed to feed you alone, not your family. You then make your way to a baker near your home. He’ll grind your grain on a water-powered mill and bake it into a loaf. You hand over 5 bronze *fori*, telling him you’ll pay the rest later when you come to collect your bread.

The sun’s up by the time you reach your current work, though for us it’s only around 6:30 AM. You’re laying bricks for a new tenement block being constructed near the great warehouses that line the waterfront. The last block burned down in that awful fire last year, and the property was purchased by some local merchant. Rumor is he’s the son of one Lord Celius Renaeo’s freedmen, and made his fortune selling glass from Caladros. Not that you really care. Like many of Spisani’s male inhabitants, you’re an unskilled day laborer (“unskilled” meaning you don’t have a trade). Chronic underemployment is a fact of life for you and the rest of Spisani’s poor free inhabitants. You take whatever work you can, from laborer to porter to longshoreman, not knowing when your next job will be. You’re forever searching for the next job- if you don’t work, there’s no money to feed your family or pay the rent. 

You watch the foreman arguing with a clerk over the price of the bricks. The clerk’s one of the merchant’s slaves. Slaves are everywhere in Spisani, perhaps around fifteen to twenty percent of the city’s population, though you can only dream of affording one. Most of the city’s slaves have some professional skills, like being able to balance a ledger, knowing a trade, or speaking one or several languages. The real advantage of owning a slave, of course, is that they’re stuck with you- they can’t take their labor to someone who pays more. It’s *much* cheaper to hire free labor for unskilled work- you only pay them for the work they do, and can let them go when the job is done. You don’t have to pay for their food, housing, or medical care, like you would a slave. Only the wealthy elite can afford to own slaves to do menial tasks, like sweeping their floors or manning their doors. 

Work stops at midday. It’s early summer, and already the heat is oppressive. You use this time to grab something to eat with some of your work companions. For 30 *fori* you buy a sausage wrapped in flatbread from a street vendor- the fast food of the Tutonian world. Work then resumes and continues until about four o’clock. The foreman signals that work is over, and you line up to receive the day’s pay. The clerk checks your name off in a ledger and places in your hand a single silver *talen*. It’s the average wage for a day laborer like yourself. Some jobs pay more, some less. 

After a long day’s work, you need to relax. You and some friends decide to head to the baths, were you can relax and unwind. Aside from being relaxing, the baths go a long way in improving the health of the Empire’s urban population. Life in a Tutonian city can be appallingly filthy and unsanitary, with disease being a fact of life. The baths are a huge complex, with many pools of hot and cold water, as well as eateries, a library, and a large park with shady walkways. You spend an hour or so here, refreshing yourself in the (relatively) clean water, but it’s soon time to go- you promised your wife you’d meet her for dinner, and woe to you if you’re late!

The sun’s beginning to go down, the western sky slowly turning a deep scarlet. You return to the baker to pick up your bread, handing him the balance of 5 *fori*. Stopping at a shop you decide to buy your wife a honey cake, a small square sweetbread drizzled with honey and nuts. You really shouldn’t spend the 15 *fori* it costs, but hopefully she’ll be so happy she’ll forget about the 82 *fori* you lost at dice a few nights ago.

sure there is a lot of stuff that they need to fix but tell me one game out there that doesn't have bugs or need fixes. there isn't, we all wish there was

if you think this game is unbalanced go play half the other games on the market that fully cater to P2W concept. honestly all the hero's are balanced as they have their strong area like damage or hp or buff while they have a weakness. take PD for example most people say he is one of the most Op hero's in the game which his buff is... but he dies super quick if not protected hence his weakness is his health, Cupid another one on the list has a cooldown of 6 seconds or else would be Op.

smurfs on the other hand... I have no issues with them, if you want to invest time in setting up a second account and lvling it then more power to you, I know plenty that set them up just for shard donations to guilds so they don't have to take shards off their mains. nothing wrong with that as anyone can do it.

as for the arena unless you aim for top 100 arena isn't worth much, any smart player will sit in a bracket that they can win all 5 of their matches easily and still collect above 50 every hour as it is the most effective way of getting HB as 40 per win x 5 = 200.. that 200 is every 2.5 hours plus say you sit at 80hb(10000-3000) an hour cause that the bracket you easily stay in and win. take 3 hours  that is  480, compare that to fighting in the top 3000-1000 and lose lets say lose half your fights out of 6 (3 hour time-frame) works out to 390.. arena is not something to focus on unless you can get below 100 as 101 you with a 50% win ratio you would average 470, still better to sit back at a higher bracket if you can win your matches and play every few hours

1) Allocate 3 focus to my Harrower.

2) Warcaster activation, cast (however I can) various debuffs on the unit, buffs on the Harrower to make it easier to hit.

3) Charge Harrower, spending 1 focus. If I'm not sure that I'll hit the first target using my charge attack, boost. Let's assume that I feel that I can reliably hit it, so I keep those 2 focus.

4) Complete initial charge attack, kill first unit, collect 1 of 3 soul tokens.

5) Attack with the Perisher, utilizing Thresher.

6) Boost the first attack roll using the soul token, to guarantee another soul token.

7) Roll attack and damages for all models in front arc and within 2 inches.

8) Attack ends. Let's assume I manage to kill 2 more models in the unit due to some poor rolls. That leaves 2 left.

9) Use Soul to buy another attack (Assuming I can't Thresher again), kill model, gain soul token.

10) Buy another attack using soul token, kill last model in infantry unit, gain another soul token.

11) See enemy warcaster within range of my gun. Spend soul token to buy ranged attack. Spend Focus to boost attack, Spend focus to boost damage, shoot the crap out of warcaster.

12) Activation ends. I should still have one more soul token on the Harrower. Does he keep that soul, or does it dissipate before next activation?

Trade is very dynamic and even if those tooltips were 100% correct they are only correct for that day.  The AI can still build markets and trade ships of their own.

The other thing is to keep in mind that it is all percent based when you look at it very simply.  For instance
1.  Home node value is 10 and control of 40%
2.  One node upstream value is 200 and control of 0%(for ease of effect here)

Here you are collecting 4 ducats in your home node and steering no trade from the neighboring node (not really possible but just accept it).  Sending ships to boost your home node to 60% will give you 2 more ducats.  If the same ships boost your power in the neighbor node to 10% then you are sending an extra 20 ducats to your home node that you collect 40% of - an increase in 8 ducats instead of 2.  This is all still affected by trade efficiency and trade steering power and blah blah blah.  Don't get too hung up in all that at first.

This is not emergence, its about distance and separation. Thoughts are part of this world and being part of this world they take time. The mind processes observations and formulates responses, all of which takes time because it happens through the brain. So observation happens first and attachments may or may not follow.

&gt; How does that serve life?

It allows for creativity. Attachments constrain, they prevent exploration of the world, they can cause someone to punish themselves as they do not fit the image of what they want to be, they are attached to some image.

&gt; I don't think that's healthy; why would I want to?

You may not have to, its what you do if you are suffering, when your mind is no longer coherent with the world and the body. If you are an attractive woman who gets everything she wants then you don't need to look or care about your own thoughts or anyone elses thoughts for that matter.

&gt; I'm not looking to pacify myself. Those who seek their own pacification do so because they don't have the strength to make coherent offensive emotions.
&gt; They are only interested in shielding themselves; strong lusts rarely worked out for them, so they conclude it's a principle to escape them, not that they're weak.

Is it really strength and weakness, or is it a matter of experience? And are offensive emotions the best (healthiest) way of dealing with ""strong lusts""? I think a young person may get away with that for a long time, burning away their youth on 'coherent' offensive emotions. Would it not be better for them to enjoy their youth, enjoy silly thoughts as they come and go and to not be attached to those thoughts or be lead into conflict and suffering over them? To that extent though, sometimes people must learn, and not just individuals but sometimes collectives as well. The state wanting to be drug-free and causing lots of suffering because of it, finding that the more they struggle against it the worse the problem becomes, until the problem becomes self sustaining and self serving, economic incentives. Is the drug war a boost to the economy (serving life) or is it destroying it (destroying life), is it any more healthy?

In over a century, people who knew you, will be gone. Some may read things you have written, have pictures of you, they may speculate who you were, but they will not know you, the life, the movement, the sound of your voice, your presence, not like those who are around you today. If you reflect on the world in this way, you might understand how some may think we are here to enjoy life and to love, not just to create coherent offensive emotions in dealing with strong lusts.

The damage output is nowhere near Fire CA. But good survivability there from the some crowd control and proc of ancient pantheon bracer to boost your Armor.

The question needs to be raised as to whether the private sector has the means or the need to create new jobs for these people. A lot of businesses don't like these pushes because, from their perspective, who wants to pay the wage of Joe Blow who doesn't want a job but was forced to get one? Many business owners would prefer he was funded by the collective public purse than to be the burden of some small business owner.

For those who actually _want_ to find work, absolutely I'd love to see a boost in job seeker and skills support. But expecting small businesses (the primary employer in this country) to pay wages for people who have little to no interest in working for them is pretty rough.

And the focus on _quantity_ of applications as opposed to _quality_ of applications seems to be just plain lazy.

0,,t1_cjbmefk,4,1406686168,,t3_2c3msv,False,leagueoflegends,False,ekko,t5_2rfxx,"Yes, definitely Trinity Force. That goes without saying. 

He has very short cooldowns for the Sheen proc once you get ranks in to the Q and you collect either the boomerang or the boulder for the 60% cooldown reset on it.

His W procs the movement speed on the third hit, which synergizes very well with the Phage. The % movement speed of the tiny form W actually scales up the flat number given from Trinity, that's why it's such an incredible combo. If you do it properly, you can get 90 movement speed out of the phage proc with rank 1 ult by last hitting a minion with the W proc. 100 for rank 2 ult. On top of that you get the % boost to your other movement speed too. That's *crazy*.

Trinity without a doubt should be your #1 goal.

After that there's a couple of ways to go I think. I feel like BotRK is going to be a popular second item. It'll synergize well in to the mini form because it'll give you faster procs on the W making you kite a lot better because of all the extra movement speed.

It'll also scale off mega form because of the extra flat AD given in it. The active also gives extra CC to your massive CC kit in the mega form.

One path to take is going either Youmuu's or Black Cleaver. The CDR from it is great, the flat armor pen could be very strong early on and both of those items would definitely be extremely valuable to you. I personally would prefer Youmuu's. With the active it would help you kite in mini form, keep up in mega form and the extra crit synergizes very well with the crit from Trinity.

Then there's the going full tank path, which is probably going to be overall the strongest one. Gnar is one **disgustingly good** initiator if you play him properly. Have you seen that CC? Oh my lord.. His kit is extraordinarily strong for initiating. The way I see it is you gather your resource bar, then use E on an enemy from your mini form. During the jump you'll switch to mega form **and** you get the extra bounce. Now you're in mega form *behind* your enemies. You can then use W to stun them, more carefully position yourself for the ult and stun them again or throw them to your team. To be able to pull this off, being tanky is going to be necessary.

I honestly think that Gnar's tankiness is completely bonkers. I mean, he gets a huge chunk of armor and magic resist in mega form, but he also gets ridiculous health regen too. That means you scale extra well with both resistances and health. Usually champions scale well off of one so you'll see them either stacking health or stacking armor/mr, but for this guy it's all up to you which path you want to take.

I love the idea of having a Warmog's or a Mallet in Gnar's kit as perhaps a 5th/6th item.

I haven't played him enough on the PBE because I'm from EU so I get +200 ping which means I can't really get to play properly, especially on a champion who needs good positioning and has skillshots like Gnar.


From what I've tested and thought of thus far, it's going to be as follows:

1. Trinity force.
 * Every time without question. Just too good to pass up on.
2. BotRK/Youmuu's
 * I'll probably prefer BotRK but I'll have to test further. The extra sustain is going to be fantastic and I think that with the AS steroid on E it's also going to be the better damage option. But as I said, I'll need to do some serious testing to be sure.
3. Randuin's Omen/Banshee's Veil
 * Depending on the game, either Armor or MR as I need it. SV might also be good if I do decide to go BotRK first.
4. Randuin's Omen/Banshee's Veil
 * The one I didn't take first. In the rare case where either one isn't necessary, I'll skip this step and go for step 5 instead.
5. Frozen Mallet/Warmog's Armor
 * The slow on FMallet seems extremely powerful for this guy. It'll make you a kiting **god** in mini form and in mega form you'll be absolutely inescapable. Warmog's if the enemy team is just so immobile that it isn't necessary to take FMallet.
6. Mercury Treads/Ninja Tabi
 * Obviously, this isn't going to be the last pick up. But one of these is going to be taken whenever I feel necessary. Since Trinity is going to be the first item, going tier 2 boots isn't going to be necessary until later on.
7. Guardian Angel
 * For the games where they have really powerful tank killers. Replace FMallet/Warmog's with this one.

I'm probably going to run 21/9/0 on him, with AD reds and quints. Possibly MS quints. Health yellows and MR blues.

I would **love** to stack CDR on him, because unlike what you said he scales **extremely well** with CDR. The Q would have a 3.6 second cooldown with this.. You'd have 3 stuns, 3 jumps and a shitload of slows in your mega form at 40% CDR. Sadly, CDR isn't very available for this guy. I would go FH but the mana would be completely wasted and it offers no health which is a shame. SV would be available but with no strong sustain it's barely worth it. Brutalizer is of course a decent buy for him but it's only 10% so you'd need 30% more. Riot really needs to make CDR more available to tanks. :&lt;

Of course, this is just what I think and how I'd like to play him. It's not that far from what you have chosen, but still somewhat different.

Try gnomes, keep your pet and head for the mines first - minetown is fun, makes picking up gear easy, and there is always the chance for a magic lamp, plus perhaps a temple you can sacrifice in! Use lots of Elbereth, reserve force bolt for emergencies and play cautiously using daggers as soon as you can. Keep one for melee, and collect throwing daggers too.

As for wizards and books, force bolt is a given and great at the start. Soon, the damage won't be enough to use even when spamming in emergencies, that's why you want to upgrade dagger skill to expert ASAP and fire volleys (even against adjacent monsters). 

The second spell can be great, or useless. Maximum level of the book is 3. If you get identify, clearing all gear without trouble is simply a matter of gaining a few levels, then you can ID and BUC at will. Remove curse can be handy, too, as will be charm monster. Magic missile is the damage spell you want after force bolt becomes too weak.

If you got a crappy secondary spell, never fear. Wizards can try to read any book they find, as long as it isn't cursed (hint: minetown altar). If it is too high a level, you'll get a warning. If you don't get one, read it right away.

Another tip for early books is the oracle level - break all the statues there, they may contain books! Otherwise buy, steal or pick up any books you can find.

0,,t1_cjbe9az,1,1406669681,,t1_cjaywin,False,buildapc,False,,t5_2rnve,"what overclocking is is essentially a free performance boost. over clocking your cpu can make a cheap processor able to ""keep up"" (or not bottleneck) your graphics card, or make an old processor do the same. what it means exactly is going into the BIOS on your motherboard and changing the voltage and run-speed settings of the processor to perform faster than factory regulation. the goal is to make your cpu run at as many Hz as possible without you pc blue-screening and keeping your voltages reasonable (which varies by cpu+mobo). 

upsides include:

* faster run times on cpu-taxing processes

* fps boost in games (depending of the processor)

downsides: 

* more power draw

* more heat produced (and by association more fan noise)

* chance of nullifying your warranty should you blow up your cpu

* reduced cpu lifespan (only if you push it too hard)

in all honesty though, a lot of people around here (including myself) will always recommend the k version because overclocking is just a free performance boost, however a 4th generation i5 isnt going to bottleneck any graphics cards for a good handful of years anyway, so from a gaming perspective it might not realistically help you at all.

moving on, no matter what kind of cooler you run, the noise is going to come down to the fans you use. most (if not all) air and liquid coolers give you the option to use a different fan than the one that comes with the device. if noise is going to be an issue, look into some really quiet fans, like the [Noctua Nf-F12's](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835608026) (really pricey) or [Antec TrueQuiet's](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835209050) (less pricey). fans come in uniformly compatible sizes, so for any 120mm heatsinks or 120mm radiators for water coolers, and 120mm fans will work.

lastly, SLI (having 2 Nvidia cards) or Crossfire (having 2 AMD cards) can deliver a significant performance boost over a single card, for example, 2 gtx 760's bench to about the same that a gtx 780ti does, while being collectively less expensive. however, it's pretty much rule of thumb to buy 1 single powerful gpu and only SLI or CF if you have too. the reason being the downsides kinda outweigh the upsides for this issue:

upsides:

* Future-proofing; SLI and CF make it easy to update an aging build by adding a second card and almost doubling graphic performance

* price/power ratio; like i said before, 2 760's can bench up there with the top-of-the-line-cards, but will be a cheaper alternative

* aesthetic; i'm a looks-guy myself, and 2 gpu's just looks awesome

downsides:

* power consumption; obviously 2 gpu's use a lot more power, and you'd need a psu that can handle it

* SLI profiles; while i'm not sure if CF works in the same manner, but Nvidia requires an SLI profile to scale the gpu's to be able to work for each game. IE, if a game doesnt have a profile, SLI wont work, and it will be like you only have 1 gpu

* heat/noise/airflow; adding a second card reduces case airflow and make everything generally run hotter, which makes your fans produce more noise

in short, the GPU renders images, makes them look right with anti-aliasing and ambient occlusion, and delivers each frame to your monitor which displays them to you. ideally you want a card that can do this 60 times in a second. while intel has a built in gpu on their processors, it is no where near as powerful as a dedicated discrete gpu. 95% of games that people still play rely much more on the power of your gpu than the power of your processor. this is why, in the case of a gaming pc, the gpu should take priority over other parts

Before I start the map I sell some weapons that I'm not going to be using like extra bows and axes, I use this gold to train Luke up in the drill grounds. I promote him and *reclass Luke* to a dracoknight. I start off the map with Palla fetching the Theif staff and with a full inventory I send it to the convoy for Yumina to snatch up. Yumina takes the thief staff and opens the chest with the boots and with another full inventory sends it to the convoy. Marth starts moving towards the north-eastern village and uses the boots. Feena dances for him and he moves out even further. The Avatar and Luke start flying around and causing mayhem. I kill poor Etzel in the process but I didn't draft him so it's fine... sort of. Yumina starts following behind Luke and the Avatar and eventually at the start of Turn 5 she arrives close enough to the castle to Rescue Marth who just recruited Minerva. I'm pretty broke and can't buy anything right now but I have plenty of weapons that I actually use remaining in my convoy. By the way, Navarre didn't do crap this level. 

*1 Rescue Charge left*

*3 Thief Charges left*

**Chapter 10 2/68 turns**

Marth steps on the water and Feena dances. The gang clear a way for Marth as he moves upwards in siezing range already. Merric is going to be needing as much EXP as possible if I want him to promote next chapter to use my final Rescue staff use. Yumina can do it but on promotion Merric will have slightly more move than her. I also use the thief staff to snag the Bullion before leaving. There isn't much 
treasure that I actually want other than the second rescue staff and the Again staff in 14. 

*1 Rescue Charge left*

*2 Thief Charges left*

**Chapter 10x 1/69 Turns**

Used the trick where you can find the true Roro with a L-switch then had Luke danced to reach Roro. I killed some extra clones before ending the map. 

**Chapter 11 6/75 Turns**

Promoted Merric before starting the map so he can use the Rescue staff. Yumina is a few levels short of promotion so Merric will have to do. I have lots to do in this map while Merric runs across the desert so he can zap Marth to him without him having to move anywhere. Luke, the Avatar and Palla all go flying in different directions. Palla covers Merric from taking too much damage, the Avatar takes on the northern 
section of the map, she's also going to be visiting the secret shop for me. Luke takes on the western side while Navarre slowly follows behind everyone getting danced by Feena. Yumina also reaches level 11 this map from Physic spamming. I grabbed nearly every treasure on the map save for the dracoshield. I could have shaved a turn here by using the Rescue to warp Feena then get danced so I could warp Marth. Don't really got a hammerne staff and use my last charge of the rescue staff. I rescued Marth on Turn 6 and before I end the map I buy some dragonslaying weapons from the secret shop.  

*1st Rescue Staff is Broken*

*2 Thief charges left*


**Chapter 12 5/80 Turns**

This was a very tricky map with Marth's durability and lots of strong enemies to kill while moving fast. The first turn starts out with the usual Marth moves out and gets danced by Feena, Marth has a wyrmslayer so killing dragons isn't going to be an issue. It's Marth having to tank tons of enemies while staying alive is the problem. Darros, the dragons and the Levin sword swordmaster all do lots of damage so Marth really needs to watch out here. I have Merric tag behind Marth to draw some of the attacks from Marth, it works really well because the enemies and Darros attack Merric instead of Marth who was at 13HP at the start of the 2nd enemy phase. Marth survives and gets healed before charging again. This time he stays on a fort and heals, the majority of the enemies are dead and my fliers are finished up killing the wyverns so they can help out again. The avatar collects the Pisces shard while Palla who I promoted into a Falcokinight takes out the enemies nearby the boss. It's funny how after all those level ups Marth has much more bulk than Palla. Luke starts killing some stragglers before Palla finishes the boss and Marth siezes. 

Again Navarre didn't do crap because he got left behind. 


**Chapter 13 4/84 Turns**

Marth gets danced across the river while everyone goes crazy. Navarre leveled up on a few enemies here, he is pretty frail so he can't fight on his own without Merric or Yumina around. The fliers do their thing and kill everything standing in Marths path. On turn 2 Palla starts heading east towards a chest a thief is about to pilfer, I want that dragonpike so I'll be bopping the thief when he picks it up. Marth keeps moving forward and more things die. I should point out that after the last map Marth has 17 defense (stat boosters huehue) so he can take a beating. I was 1 tile short of a 3 turn clear which is unfortunate but it lets Marth get the boss kill at least. Before seizing on Turn 4 I kill as many enemies as possible and squeeze out as many staff uses with Merric as possible. 

*2 Thief Charges left*

**Chapter 13x 2/86 Turns**

The fliers run through the dark while Marth gets danced. I want that Iote's Shield on the top right corner of the map so I need Marth to reach it ASAP before the enemies get routed. I position everyone so the enemies except for the Ballista die. I nab the chest with Marth and finish off the last of ballistas in the dark. I gotta point out that I really like the music that plays on this map.

I'm just treading water collecting spirits for trades and putting myself in the position to max spirits out more easily when I want to.

I still haven't even started, to be honest. It's a big project and my free time is close to none. 

&gt;Is it correct to assume that for the process of building a super-strong team, you should be using spirits found in your own region (due to the limit break)?

Not necessarily. With how prevalent trading is you can make a team of a completely different region if that floated your boat, but the path of least resistance would indeed just be using your homegrown resources organically. 

&gt;Is there any consensus on which sorts of spirits are best to utilize in battles?

Rs, SRs, and some maxxed out UC.

&gt;I'm currently using a mix of UCs and Rs, but in general I noticed that most spirits in a rarity tier seem to have somewhat similar stats. 

They do, but in general the next tier up will always be better given the extra levels.

&gt;There are a few Cs that I'd love to try boosting for battle use, but I'm not sure if doing that will be pointless or not.

That is completely pointless. 

&gt;Are any stats considered more valuable than others?

I'd say no, not really. I value spirits based on the total package valuing all the attributes more or less the same.

&gt;Regarding limit breaks in particular, I'm assuming easy-to-find dupes can be merged guilt-free, but R and SR dupes are probably best for trading or breaking, right?

Yes, they're best serving you as trade bait and level breakers. Also as max stat mergings if you went that route. Only do that if you are serious and will see it through otherwise you are wasting time and resources. ",3,TonyMHFan,True,t3_2bzkxm,0,cjagbjf,0,1434946898,

From here on out it would function just like the gravelords where up to 3 victims can invade the user at the same time.

If a player dies to the abyss phantoms then a black bloodstain will appear in the user's world which he can collect for an item, some souls, and be able to watch the abyss phantom butcher the victim (activates like normal blood stain but shows the victim and the killer) 

The covenant would be linked to Caitha- goddess of tears and function as the gravelords should have. The aggro range will create completely unpredicatble pve and players who don't wish to engage in pvp are free to just smash the statue and get on with their games.

A general MvM team is made up of:

-Scout: The scout's job is to mainly collect all the team's money. Scout also slows bosses with the Mad Milk and marks them for death with the Fan of War. Can be replaced by Spy at times.

-Soldier: Soldier is a damage class; his main job is to do the most damage to the bots. Often uses the Buff Banner for the damage boost.  

-Demoman: Demo is a damage class. His main job is to take out the medics with stickies. Can be replaced with the Sniper sometimes.

-Heavy: Heavy's a damage class, but not much else. Just focus on doing as much damage as possible. Let the others take care of tanks: heavies do reduced damage against them.

-Engie: Engies do damage and block Scouts with Sentries, keep the team alive with dispensers, and bring them too the front lines with teleporters. Without one, your team is history.

-Medic: Medic keeps the team alive and protects them, along with giving out some more damage. Make sure to max out projectile shield ASAP: it's arguably the most important job in the game.

A) Not doing your job good enough

I'm sure other people on here could give you links to well-known Let's Players and the like, but here's a few bits of advice from my (100 hour permanoob perspective).

CK2 is really fun to roleplay; seeking vengeance, going on crusades, plotting the downfalls of people just to see them burn, etc.

Almost everyone will suggest starting in Ireland (aka Noob Island); you've got Christianity (no Crusades against you), plenty of small, petty kingdoms to wage war with in relative safety, and clear points of expansion - unify Ireland, spread to Brittania, cross the channel from there, and so on. If you're looking for something a bit more cut-throat, the Pagan cultures have some cool perks, but starting with Gavelkind can be a nightmare of bloody succession wars until you reform your faith.

To do all this, you'll need a few things:

- Casus Belli (""cause of war"") - A legal claim on some land (fabricated by your Chancellor, married into, creating a duchy that expands a bit beyond your borders), heathens to be converted, and more. Unlike most games, you actually have to have a ""reason"" to fight. (Though some reasons are more bloodthirsty than others.)

- Vassals - The people who serve you, either directly or indirectly through an intermediate vassal. Let's say you're the emperor; there's a city run by a mayor, who reports to a count who controls the cities in a county, who reports to a duke who oversees counties, who reports to a king of dukes, who might then report to you (assuming you're not Emperor and King at the same time, though you ought to be). You want to keep your vassals happy so that they'll give you troops and pay their taxes and not plot to have your wine poisoned or your son murdered.

- Opinions - How much someone likes/dislikes you, from -100 to 100. You can mouse over the number to see a breakdown of exactly what they like and dislike about you. Ambitious people will have an automatic -50 to their liege, and being a new ruler gives you a really bad hit to opinion until you've been on the throne a while. You can award honorary titles with a pittance to make some people like you, you can land others (not ambitious people, if it can be helped), or simply send them cash money for a temporary happiness boost.

- Troops - From the military tab in the upper left, you can raise your levies, hire mercenaries, and train retinues. Levies are a sort of militia that you don't want to raise too long, as it can slowly anger your vassals. Levies raised from the counties you own personally (your ""demesne"") don't make anyone angry, but you do have to pay for them. Retinues you pay to create, and to reinforce, but once they're filled up they're free for you and don't count as raised troops preventing you from going to war.

- Succession Laws - When you die, your heir inherits your stuff and you play as them, assuming all goes well. The game only ends when there is no one of your dynasty (your extended family) eligible to inherit a landed title. You can check and change the succession laws, though there are certain prereq.'s and it can easily upset people.

- Your Council - Your advisers and lackies, the most important people to your realm other than yourself. To start, use your chancellor to improve relations with vassals who dislike you, and/or to fabricate claims on neighboring lands. Your marshal can train troops. Keep your spymaster scheming against the leaders of dissident factions (which you can monitor under the factions tab). Tell your steward to collect a tithe in your capital, and use your seer/bishop to spread your religion if there are heathens/heretics that you're concerned about.",6,BluesyBlue,True,t3_2bwzdn,0,cj9svu4,0,1434935580,

You don't have to spend $25.00 to make your battleground queue reset, for example. You can spend $25.00 on an entirely optional mount that does exactly the same as all the other mounts available for ingame currency or achievements.

These ""freemium"" games suck you in because it's a couple of dollars here and there. You find yourself thinking, ""Well, if I spend $5 on some tokens, I can speed up this building and collect this farm stuff sooner"". In some of them, you get to the point where you can't do anything in game for literally hours until things have finished - unless you pay.

The level 90 boost is a different matter, I don't have a personal issue with it because I'd never even consider doing it, but I can understand why some people do.

For the digital you are SAVING $5 and still get the digital perks compared to what you would pay for the expansions.

If you're not completely sold on the game and you're not positive you will stick with it through the expansions, it really becomes about how much the physical items and in game skins are to you. As I understand it, the Vanguard weapons/armor aren't things that are exclusive to the limited edition, you just get a boost to give you access to them sooner. If you end up dropping the game before the expansions and the books end up collecting dust, you may regret the purchase, but if you love the game and would have purchased the expansions anyway, worst case scenario you're paying $5 for some neat in game skins and a bunch of lore based physical items, which I would say is worth it but everyone is different.",1,csjenova,True,t3_2bwyfb,0,cj9qadg,0,1434934316,

I don't agree with this statement at all. Unemployment isn't automatically an unbearable burden, nor is the program designed to send benefits only to those in dire circumstances.

Casters do not receive the same treatment with their damage since their abilities are spell-oriented rather than weapon-oriented.  It would only make sense to split up the caster gear if it gave bonuses for elemental damage, poison damage, etc.

That being said, the Maiming/Striking convention still persists in some forms (such as Soldiery gear), but the devs have been leaning more towards combining some of their gear into a ""Slaying"" umbrella term that covers all Strength-based classes.

There are a few new mechanics, but it's really not all too bad once you get the hang of it. All of these mechanics involve the Extra Deck, formerly called the Fusion Deck. You also can only have 15 monsters in it, unlike the past where its size was unlimited. XYZ and Synchro monsters start the duel in the Extra Deck.

**XYZs** are pretty straightforward. Do note that XYZ monsters do not have levels; they have a Rank. So anything that requires a level won't work with XYZ monsters. To summon an XYZ monster you need two (or sometimes more) monsters of the same level face-up on the field. You place them on top of each other and summon an XYZ monster whose Rank is equal to their Level on top of those monsters. The monsters used are now called XYZ materials and are detached and sent to the graveyard to activate the XYZ monster's effects.

**Synchros** are a little harder to summon. You need to have at least two face-up monsters on the field whose combined levels equal the level of the Synchro monster. In addition, exactly one of those monsters must be a ""Tuner"" monster (it will say if it is in the box next to the monster's type). When you summon a Synchro, you send its materials to the grave and place the Synchro monster face-up in attack or defense.

**Pendulums** are a little more confusing. Rather than explain them here, just watch [this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs08XuC62LU) Pendulums are a new mechanic and as of yet don't really have any good cards. The Qliphoth/Qliphort monsters will be the first powerful Pendulum deck, but they won't be out until November in the US.

---

As far as getting back into collecting and playing, I recommend finding and building a new deck to learn the mechanics and get yourself started. When you first build a deck, I recommend planning it out first. DuelingNetwork.com is a website where you can build a deck online and test it against other players. You can also find a program called DevPro (or YGOPro if you're on a Mac/Linux) which does the same thing. The difference is you can build without an internet connection using DevPro/YGOPro and when you duel, the program will automatically apply your card's effects, while Dueling Network is manual.

When you find a deck you like, I recommend buying singles for the core of the deck. Find the cards that you need for the Main Deck and any mandatory cards for the Extra Deck. This will be the cheapest part of building it and will also give you the freedom later to buy booster packs and add to your deck while still having a decent, working deck. TCGPlayer.com is a good place to look for cards, especially commons that you need in large numbers, while eBay can be better for more expensive stuff.

As far as decks to start with, there are a few simple, cheap ones you can start with. [Machina Gadgets](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Gadget), [Battlin' Boxers](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Battlin'_Boxer), [Fire Kings](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Fire_King), [Six Samurai](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Six_Samurai), and [Blackwings](http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Blackwing) are all decent, cheap beginner decks to look into.

If there's a gaming store near you, try to find out if/when they have a yugioh day where players come and duel. If so, you can see if the players there can help you build a new deck or get the hang of playing. If not, feel free to message me or post here for more help. I've personally built all of the decks I suggested for other new players, so I'm pretty familiar with how they all run and how to make a basic build for a low price.

 I don't know what standards everyone else has in terms of deciding on how viable a certain unit becomes, but I feel like it's nearly impossible to collectively group units into tiers like this. Because in your future viability list you have units that will only be very viable in niche roles like Sodis and Signas. Other than mono teams and the starter dungeons units like Signas and the other elemental dmg reduction units don't have a steadfast place in the meta because everything relies on high hit count BB spam teams and spark modifiers or crit modifiers rather than elemental boosts.

I actually used a stopwatch on a higher level with my standard candy farming configuration...another thread on the sub indicated that everything (screen wipe, max cookies, fast cookies) maxed out puts you right at around 5500 cookies per minute, and that's pretty accurate. 

Note that we will **not** be including your building CPS on the sheet - we only want to include collected cookies, and only the actual number of them - not the adjusted number (ie: each cookie is not worth 10k cookies or whatever after RC adjustment - just 1 cookie per cookie). I'd say get to Level 25 or so and start a stopwatch as soon as the Level starts to see how long it takes. The cookies/level table (from /u/JohnyDL) is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/CookieCollector/comments/25e86p/max_cookies_per_second_collected_from_screen/chgqb3s).

Also, keep in mind that it takes a lot more than 2 minutes to set up a full auto collect setup with screen wipes and a Level 50 Fast Cookies, and I had quick candy farming in mind. :) The less time it takes you to max the autoclicker, the faster you can optimally prestige for max candies per second. A 90 second set up has you finishing Level 14, and a 2 minute set up is optimal at Level 15, netting an average of 1 candy every 2.5 seconds or so.

I'll post my set up when I get back inside...it's pretty efficient.

Edit: Here's my setup - it's a modified version of one found elsewhere on the sub, and it probably only works really well if you have 500k RC or so. I'm sure the spreadsheet works just fine on a smaller scale, though - we might need to add the rest of the level table in to make it work.

Goal: ~1 Quadrillion CPS from buildings in under 120 seconds

1. Swipe to get a few cookies - just enough to start buying buildings.
2. Purchase 1 of each building until you get to Train.
3. Hold your finger down on the Train button and buy as many as you can - I usually stop at about 40, but this will vary for you depending on RC's and all that.
4. Swap over to the building upgrades tab and buy upgrade levels 1-3 of Train. Level 4 is optional if you have enough RC's.
5. Back to the buildings tab - buy one of each structure until you get to Vortex.
6. Buy up as many vortexes (vortices?) as you can - these will be harder to buy than the Trains. I try for 30 of these, but it can take precious seconds.
7. Swap over to the building upgrades tab and grab Level 1-3 of the Vortex upgrade.
8. Back to buildings - you'll buy a Dark Matter and then start focusing on Time Warpers and Nanotechs. I shoot for 30-35 Time Warpers and 15-20 Nanotechs, and it's probably the most time consuming part of the process.
9. Over to Building Upgrades - generally, I will try for Level 3 Time Warpers and Level 2 Nanotech, but the real goal is be DONE with buildings in the 400-500 Trillion CPS range.
10. Now to the ""Other Upgrades"" tab - the yellow up arrow. Start at the bottom, with CPS boost - try for 20 Levels of this (21 if you're feeling spunky). Now, you should be in the 1 Quad/sec range.
11. Autoclicker - run this up to Level 38.
12. And finally, Fast Cookies. In my testing, I didn't notice a difference between Level 40 and Level 41 (Level 39 was about a 5% drop in collected CPS), so I shoot for Level 40 here. The 40th level takes a bit over 10 Quad, which you should have if you followed the guide above and have similar multipliers to me. If not, adjust as needed. :)

Then, you go out to the Cookie Screen and let the game run until you get the level referenced by the spreadsheet - once you get there, prestige and do it all over again. :)",2,readingonmyphone,True,t3_2bkr6p,0,cj6zgqz,0,1434885358,

I mean, I'll be the first to admit, i loved having the ability to play competitive magic any day of the week without traveling. And not just play magic, but play it correctly. 99% of the rules interactions in the game are handled exactly like they are supposed to, and actually playing MTGO helped me better understand how the rules worked for the game and how triggers and the stack worked much more completely than rules tests.

HOWEVER! Despite all these positives, I can't get over the negatives anymore. I'm done with MTGO, I'm going to actually sell everything I have, collect and gtfo. Not even bringing the new client into it (which was the sincher btw), let's bring up a few things: irl looking at card prices and seeing what sort of deals you can get is relatively simple, you have tcgplayer, scg, channel fireball, ebay, etc. It doesn't take that long to look up the prices of these cards and they are all fairly streamlined enough to make it easy. In mtgo, I have Marlon, MTGGoldFish, and MTGTraders. That isn't including the thousands of random bots that people start up that can sometimes offer cards at vastly different prices than you see online. The ""classifieds"" themselves are way too clunky to be of any use to anyone, unless you already have a buyer in mind, not if you are looking for a potential buyer or seller, which defeats the whole point of the classifieds as being a search.

Number 2, the EV on many events being decreased or dropped all together. It used to be that cube was free with enough cube event tickets. It was a phantom event, so it makes sense that if you were good enough, every so often you get a free draft. Now it costs 2 event tickets ($2) plus cube tickets to get into a cube, and that's the cheap end. Not to make any mention of the dropping of Momir and Pauper dailies, which I guess the fear being that 10% of the population would be good enough to go actually infinite in MTGO and not make anymore money off them. The horror that 90% of the MTGO userbase would still have to buy tickets. Did I mention you pay $10 to make the account with cards that you can't actually play anywhere, and a few booster packs. You also have the limited sealed events that have dropped so much so in EV that you might as well your money when you enter them unless you get 6 constructed playable mythics with your sealed pool. Their mindset on getting rid of places where you could potentially go infinite doesn't make sense to me because only a small fraction of the community was actually skillful enough to make it to that point. So it is a pure revenue increasing venture on an online product that is already making a lot of revenue. It just shows that they have a complete disregard for how their prices, entry fees and payouts all can impact the demand for the product negatively, which would lead to less people paying, not just less people going infinite.

Thirdly, the new client, and the old. Clunky, not user friendly, lags for inexplicable reasons, and only redeeming quality is that it follows magic rules fairly well. The new client though is much worse for me because it just sucks up so much bandwidth that I can't actually watch a stream while playing magic or inbetween rounds like I did on the old client. I'm not going to run a program that is so terrible that it forces me to focus on it even when I'm not doing anything with it. So yeah, I'm done with MTGO.

Many times, you can be completing many of them at a time. Also, when you kill monsters for Fields of Valor objectives, they will count for your RoE too. Many of them are repeatable too, and will reward you with a currency called Sparks. Sparks can be used to purchase Weapons as you level up, and even a decent set of level 99. 

Make sure you always have Signet when you leave town, this will allow you to obtain crystals for killing enemies that yield experience. Crystals can be a good source of money early on. Also, make sure you save everything at first. Almost anything can be used in a quest, or sold on the Auction House for some type of profit.

&gt;Don’t let the memories fade away - use them to boost your XP! You could be getting up to 50% additional Divination XP on Treasure Hunter this weekend.

&gt;Unlock a Treasure Hunter chest from [01:00 BST on 25th July](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Divine+Recall+-+Start&amp;iso=20140725T01&amp;p1=136) to [00:59 BST on 29th July](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Divine+Recall+-+End&amp;iso=20140729T01&amp;p1=136) for a chance to win **fading memories**.

&gt;When activated and equipped in your pocket slot, a fading memory will extend the duration of wisps, and enriched wisps, when gathering memories making earning Divination XP a much quicker process.

&gt;When you’ve collected as many memories as you can hold and head to the rift to convert them and you’ll find your fading memory will give you an additional 25% XP. Plus, you’ll have an increased chance to spawn chronicles when converting memories.

&gt;The Divine Recall bonuses stack with all existing Divination bonuses - including the diviner’s outfit - and when combining memories with divine energy. Fading memories have 200 charges each, with one used per memory converted and two per enriched memory, but they can be stacked.

&gt;On top of all that, Divination lamps and stars - plus prismatic lamps and stars used on Divination - will give 50% extra XP.

&gt;When Divine Recall ends, your fading memories won’t be removed. You can continue to use them until their charges run out.

&gt;Everyone gets at least one Key every day, and RuneScape members get two! You can also get your hands on more through gameplay – just [visit the wiki](http://services.runescape.com/m=rswiki/en/Treasure_Hunter) to find out how, and learn a little more about Treasure Hunter at the same time.

[**Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Game**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/805/buffy-vampire-slayer-game) - This is a fun game, and I get this out several times a year to play.  Always enjoyable.  In two player games, one person controls the baddies, and one controls the Gang.  More players, characters get divided up.  Roll and move at it's core, you select some players, move around the board to different parts of Sunnydale collecting items.  Buffy is great with weapons, Willow better with magic, etc.  A neat platform on the board tracks daytime/nighttime.  Vamps can only move outside at night, but they can use the sewers anytime.  Oz and Veruka turn into werewolves at night, and turn on their friends.  You have a mission to complete/foil to win the game.

It's a great theme, nice components, has highlights from the show, and lots of touches that make it feel just like the Buffyverse.  Really nice game.

[**Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Board Game**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/7822/buffy-vampire-slayer-board-game) - Not to be confused with just ""The Game"", the Board Game is not fun at all.  Only played it for abuot 10 minutes and just ended the game.  Seriously terrible and I would never own it, and give it away if I did.  But its a British publication, so you may not come across it.

[**Buffy CCG**](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/8930/buffy-vampire-slayer-ccg) - This is a dead collectible card game in the Buffyverse, and I bought a ton of cards when they were cheap years ago.  Still have some boxes of booster packs unopened.  As a Buffy fan, the cards are really great.  All the character, locations, plot points and more.  If you just want to collect the cards, help yourself.  

But the game is...well...I don't know, because after many attempts to play the game, I still don't know if I've done it right.  It's a very confusing rulebook, and the play is unexciting.  You set up a deck and it kind of just plays itself.  Really disappointing game, and has bad reviews, but also had a dedicated following of players, so someone out there liked it and saw some strategy in building decks.  If you can find a lot of cards cheap, it might be worth it, but probably not.

When negotiating raises, you need to factor in local inflation rates.  If inflation is 2.2% and you get a 2% raise, you actually lose some purchasing power.  Do that long enough, and you see a lower standard of living in spite of regular 2% raises.  When I'm in bargaining, I figure out the average monthly inflation rate over the past year and if it's 1.9%, I tell the employer '1.9% is the new zero', since its what you need to break even.

For minimum wage, it gets even more complicated.  People with higher incomes have more inflation protection than those at the poverty line.  Even things as simple as the cost of hamburger - if you are poor, you pay the going rate every week or so when you go to the store.  If you've got some income, you can buy lots when it's on sale.  Also, richer folks can lock in a five year mortgage and have some housing cost certainty, where a minimum wage worker probably can't get or afford a mortgage in the first place and will be at the mercy of his landlord raising the rent.

Here in Canada, when you do a year to year comparison, the minimum wage is now exactly what it was in 1975.  This is actually a good thing, because it was lower than that for a long time, before a couple of the bigger provinces raised the minimum wage and boosted the average upwards.

Basically, if you get a raise that is less than inflation that year, your employer is telling you that you are overpaid, and he's going to simply reduce your cost of living increases until your purchasing power is where he thinks it should be.

Lots of people just don't get this.  They live somewhere with inflation averaging 2.1% and they get a 1.5% raise and start mentally spending that money, when in fact they should be looking at their budget and figuring out where they can cut some things back.",3,Slimpikin,True,t3_2bld85,0,cj6fr3d,0,1434875815,

2 peices of advice that will improve your game tramendously.

-map knowledge is the key to success. This comes with playtime but there are ways to learn quicker. Always know where the powerups are, the different routes to base and the common ""boost lanes"". You can look at all the rotation maps [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tagpro/wiki/maps) and can practice them by going to the IRC page.



- Never forget your powerups. Close games are won and lost by who controls the powerups. They will spawn 1 minute after they are collected so time your movements accordingly. Also let.your offensive players get powerups if they are able to.


On defense move less than "" you"" probably do. On offense be patient, you have 12 minutes to get 3 caps- the defense will make mistakes and your job is to capitalize when they do.


Hope to see you around- also mumble is great, I would recommend just so you can get into a 6v6 game at 300% speed game. Mic's arent required to get on mumble- there are lots of people who don't use mumble simpley as an organizing platform.

**Floor 1**

Dungeon started pretty easy, Kraken 1 on a 3 turn counter, Kraken 2 on a 4 turn counter.  I am ok at getting the Kirin matches, so I made pretty short work of them as I killed them off one at a time after stalling one turn.

**Floor 2**

Cerberus was on a 2 turn counter (annoying).  With my lack of confidence in Kirin skills, I went for the big shot instantly and got it so I killed him in one turn.

**Floor 3**

MY GIRL!!!! ... with a 1 turn counter and guess who only has 2 green orbs? Of course SHE is the one that will kill me.  I can survive one hit, but that's it. Knowing I can’t get the Kirin skill off on what I have I just go as big as I can with comboing and hope for the best... and it pays off! Kill of Lilith in 1 turn and...and... could it be!?!? A SUCCUBUS EGG!!!! Now shit gets real...

**Floor 4**

Hey you want that Succubus don’t you? Here’s 2 Vampires on a 1 turn counter, and 1 on a 2 turn counter, screw you.  I have about 16000ish health, so 2 hits would kill me, so I gotta go big..... aaaaaaaand shit, neither dies...... but what is this? One is hurt enough that he resurrects! I live! But now I have to withstand this other vampire.  Luckily, I remember I have Odin on my team and realize he will heal me just enough to withstand the last vampier’s attack!  Knowing this, I focus my fire on the other 2 vampires with the 2 turn countdown so I can kill them off before their next go.  The plan pays off, I survive with about 1000/2000ish health and defeat the vampires.

**Floor 5**

“Hey, I heard you need some extra turns to get your skills ready, lemme help you with that.” -Bitch Ass Hades.  I hit him with one go of Kirin powered up attacks, and then stall a couple turns to get everyone ready (well, Echidna), as well as heal up with Odin to be ready for the Satan pre-emptive (Ult Odin soooo clutch).  With about 3 left on his countdown, I set up the 2 bottom rows as 1 combo each of red, blue, green and light but “mess them up” to save them for Satan. [Shout out to u/Stuppsaqt and his guide earlier this week!](http://www.reddit.com/r/PuzzleAndDragons/comments/2b96da/i_couldnt_find_a_good_anubis_guide_out_there_so_i/)  I then use basically the other 60% of the board to defeat Hades.  This gave me a sure Kirin boost on the first turn against Satan, as well as a decent combo since I basically have a surefire 4 combo right off the bat.

**Floor 6**

The man of the hour... Satan.  Boom, delay him right off the bat.  Now is the time!  Hit him with my 2 Kirin actives to knock off like 2.5 million, now he “only” has like 4 million health.  First turn, pretty big move, takes out a good chunk of his health.  Second move, I keep the 25x alive and get him for another good hit and throw in the Odin active for good measure.  Third move, ANOTHER solid 25x hit and I got him on the ropes with about 1/8 of his health.  I know I just need to keep the combo going for this last turn... and I hit it! ... and some more combos drop... and some more light orbs... and I get a 10 combo and just absolutely erase Satan!

The whole world stands up! The lord of the underworld is defeated! This 300 day player clears his first Mythical dungeon, gets some much needed revenge, and collects his bounty of 1 ever elusive Succubus (so also about 50 more box space after using those damn Ghostrings) and the dark lord himself to use for future devil teams.

Honestly,  I'm not sure what this is for EP   ...but daggerfall cov  has stros M'kai  and AD has Kenrathi's roost,  it's a very low lvl island, that's good for getting you to lvl 6 -8 or so.  so when you hit the main area... you push to 10 fairly effortlessly.   I would look into  if you've bypassed that starter/noob zone.  

Best way to get gear... honestly.  craft it.    I highly recommend making a stand alone crafting alt.  Something easy to lvl.  Sorc/destro staff or DK destro staff.   and then just focus all crafting through that character.  Refined crafting materials are pretty cheap.  500gold for a 100 stack is perfectly doable.   can make a fresh set of white gear every 2 lvls.     Eventually,  you'll have enough gold.  making a fresh set of green,  items every 2 lvls is no sweat.   Crafting is less stressful than worrying about quest loot or item drops.  If you score a blue... maybe see if it's better,  otherwise.  sell/decon or trade out any ""loot"" items you find.  

Skills in the game,  lvl as you use them.  you have 5 action slots.  when you put a skill from a particular line in an action slot,  that skill will increase,  and the skill tree  will advance as well.   Any time you get exp.  killing stuff, exploration pops,  quest turn ins.   It's perfectly viable to lvl skills and ability trees just by quest turn in exp.   But you have to mind which skills you have slotted when.   At lvl 15 you're granted a second 5 slot action back which you can swap between.   

As a general rule.  any attack or active ability has 4 ranks, and then can be morphed.  the morph then has four ranks.   abilities get a bit stronger as they rank up.   A good rule of thumb,  is look into what skills you want,  slot them and get them morphed.   so your primary attacks are training at least.   Sorc has a lot of good skills accessible early.   the morphs are fairly ""established""  which ones are ""good""  

There is a respec,  but currently it's per skillpoint.  regardless of how many you want to re-asign you'll be charged for as many as your char has total.   wait a awhile.  skill points become much easier to get later.  you can easily dabble in different skills,  armors, weapons,  and not be in any real risk of screwing your character.   morphs are slightly worse,  as if you pick a dumbass morph you're only option would be to respec.    they're implementing change to this process but won't be for a little while til it goes live    ..respec are done in your faction's capital city at the shrines.  there are shrines that reset ability pts,  and stat points.  

There are multiple ways to get skill points.  leveling up grants 1 ea lvl.  the main story quest will grant one each time you do a section of that.  Larger zone story quests will grant a skillpoint,  each zone's public group dungeon normally has a group boss that gives a skillpoint. 4-man dungeons all have a quest tht grant a skillpoint.   and skyshards give a skillpoint after you collect 3.   also.. at lvl 10.  jump into PvP.  the n00b/intro pvp quests give a skill point,  and there are skyshards in Cryodil   (you can easily get 10-15 skill points by aprox lvl 10)

people on white horses bought the imperial edition.  it's a 1g welfare mount.   if you didn't buy the imp edition,  can upgrade to it for $20.   it's a good deal.  the 1g mount saves a lot of early game hassle.  and is avail to any char you ever make.   the baseline ingame horse is 17k   and the good ones are 42k.   there's not really any point in buying the 17k  ones.  so essentially if you don't get the imp edition,  you have to save 42k gold for every char before you can move faster than a sprint.  

As a mage you are squishier.   The key is CC and AOE.   mages also have an armor spell.   But,  as a mage the idea is to not let anything pound on you.   I would recommend googling sorc AOE builds.  they're really effective.   And will give you a good idea on which morphs to take.   If you're fighting bosses or single targets.   just sub out crystal shards.  Sorc isn't that complex a class honestly.

a standard AOE sorc fight is.   CC with shattering prison,  which is a morph of encase.  a dark magic skill.   dropping elemental wall, which is a destro ability.  then dropping liquid lightning.  which is a morph of lightning splash,     Endless fury  is you ""execute""  or finisher.     can run these few spells all day and kill shit effortlessly.    pop the sorc armor spell or use overcharge ult  if you want to get fancy.  once your destro staff is high enough for impulse it's ultra easy mode.  

As a mage,  there's very little to zero benefit to doing anything other than 7/7 light.   best argument might be 5 light  2 heavy.  as heavy armor can give some armor lvl.  and spell resist.   mages use magika,  light armor syncs with that goal.  provides spell boosts,  crit, magika regen etc etc.  

do some searches for addons.   there's also a lot of good threads here on builds, general n00b advice,  definitions of the various terminology/slang used in ESO.   some of the addons,  knowing what build you're shooting for and the spells to focus on... and other small tips can save you a lot of time and head ache.  

i mean,  as a slight tip.   don't ever repair gear.  repair costs are incredibly high as a low lvl.  just craft whites.   don't pay to teleport.  joing a guild.  a large trade guild.  teleport to a guild mate and use the wayshrine you pop out next to to ...travel to where you wanted.   never pay the fee to teleport.  dump a point into the mage/fighter guild intimidate/persuade skills.  they'll save you time and gold by bypassing quests that have those options.  there's addons for skyshards.  skill/armor swapping. tracking multiple quests.  guild store search, combat info.  aesthetic changes.  some of them are fluff,  others really improve the game.  look into some addons

Base Set cards are pretty popular, and a lot of people are trading them. It can get expensive if you're looking for the holos and first editions, but if you're looking just to complete the set with regular rares, it's pretty cheap. It also adds a fun twist to look for shadowless/first edition and holos.

Flashfire is very new so a lot of people are also trading those cards for specifics they're looking for as they already assume that people want Flashfire cards. In that way, it's kind of a self-sustaining flame. This will probably change when Furious Fist is released.

Furious Fist is the newest set and will be released on August 14th. If you buy a booster box or two on preorder, you have a good chance of finishing the set waaaaay before others do, giving you an opportunity for the best possible trades and/or profit. When this set is released, people could in turn generally offer better deals for Flashfire cards, or more expensive trades. The reason it would get more expensive is the fact that enough time will have passed to allow more people to come close to collecting the set, allowing sellers to charge more. (Although this isn't likely and won't be widespread). 

So yeah, I think Base Set and Flashfire are good to start off with. Maybe instead of Flashfire, go ahead and preorder a Furious Fist box so you can focus on Base for now.

You can't really steal from people on WoW. If your character dies, it keeps all of its gold, equipment and items. In other games your character might drop some items or money on death which other players can then pick up, but not on WoW. In that sense it's a safe game to play in terms of keeping everything you've earned.

However, it *is* possible to scam players. People can still trade gold and items with one another. Additionally guilds may often sell certain services for large amounts of gold (such as boosting players in difficult raid dungeons). When guilds offer these services they tend to make good on their offers because they want to keep a good reputation. However it would be possible for a guild to scam you out of a large sum of gold if they wanted to.

Guilds also have collective bank vaults which can store gold and items. Usually the bank is controlled by high ranking guild members (officers) and the guild master. There have been many cases of guild masters emptying out their guild bank and stealing off into the night. It's easy to change your name, move to another realm and start over. 

Players can also scam each other or ninja very good equipment in raids - but if they do this their reputation will go down the shitter very quickly, even on big realms.

It's a 4 set effect that gives 30% boss, 50 w.att, among other things. I would suggest getting the thief set. (Royal Assassin Bonnet, Eagle Eye Assassin Shirt, Trixter Assassin Pants, and the most expensive item, a Fafnir Damascus Dagger.) To scroll those items, for now I would suggest you do easy gollux either solo, or with a friend every single day for a few weeks. Collect both the green and blue coins. For 60 coins, you can buy an occult scroll for armor for attack. This is a 90% scroll that adds 1 attack to any piece of armor. It booms upon failure. Use these scrolls on your cRA Armor pieces. As for the dagger, I would suggest waiting for a farmable event and abusing it by getting shield scrolls, protection scrolls, and whatever w.att scroll the coin shop will have, and perfecting the dagger. This will take a lot of work. Other items you should be on the look out for / interested in buying: Tyrant Lycaon Equips (Cape, Belt, Shoes) - Capes are typically 1b each, Belts can be 2-5b each, and shoes are like 7b each, but I haven't seen any on the market in ages. These equips receive insane stat boosts upon a successful item enhancement, but never risk blowing one up. Wait for Superior Shielding Wards to come to the cash shop to enhance them. As for sweetwater, the only SW equips you should be using are the Katara (as they aren't used in the cRA set), the Glasses, and the Tattoo. Pendants you're going to want to use Advanced Gollux Scrolls to make Reinforced Gollux Pendants, I would suggest just ""Yolo scrolling"" these until you can afford Superior ones. Earrings and Rings you want Superior Gollux Earrings, Superior Gollux Ring, Reinforced Gollux Ring, Solid Gollux Ring, and, preferably a Lightning God Ring but as far as I know they are unobtainable at the moment.

Centuries ago, the smog filled atmosphere and sicknesses plaguing most of the population forced us to gather a small group of 200 healthy individuals from various cultures and races  to colonize a new planet, Gilese 581, which turned out to be pretty habitable after all. It was a project long in the making, and completed, we’re sure, just in time to avoid the inevitable extinction of humanity on Earth.

On Gilese 581, now called New Earth, we had a second chance. Humans started civilization from scratch. With a renewed vigor for green practices and preserving nature, we built a small society, without the intention to expand across the whole planet as we had done before, and we had managed to do so. We had advanced greatly in technology before the pollution and over-population was too much for Earth to handle. Unfortunately, the solar-powered renewable energy advances came far too late for us to make good use of them back on Earth, but they allowed the original colonists here to establish a strong and wealthy civilization on our new home.

There was one problem though. On the way to this new planet, the digital archive of all recorded history that the colonists brought with them was destroyed in a fire upon entering the atmosphere of New Earth, and only a fraction of the data was salvaged. It then became the goal of the historians and scientists to discover a way to recover this history, and what better way than to go back in time and collect it themselves?

It was this year that the time machine was completed, and it had already been used to travel fifty years into the past and back. Now it was time to test it out on Earth, but we would be going back much farther.

There was a plan. Five of us were chosen, an engineer, that’s me, a scientist, a historian, an architect, and a laborer.

Myself and the scientist had created a data repository that could hold thousands of terabytes of data as well as a stealth camera and receiver satellite designed to look like space rock – we named it after Halley’s comet – that would scan Earth as it passed over.

Using what data we had left, the historian had decided on the best date to travel back to – Egypt 2500BCE, the time of one of Earth’s greatest known civilizations and hopefully the most receptive to our appearance, plus we already had a lot of data from earlier Earth.

The architect had designed three enclosures based on ancient designs, one for the repository, and two to feed the signal to a small pop-up base that we would leave behind on Earth’s moon to be collected on our way back once we returned to our time.

The laborer was there to help us construct the enclosures, guide the other humans, and install the signal boosters in the stones we’d be using.

So here we were. Our time machine had crashed  through a house in an ancient Egyptian village, the humans of the past staring at us in awe as we emerged from our craft, and us holding the plans for the most famous pyramids in Earth’s history.

It was only on the long ride back to New Earth that I realized something – those ancient aliens drawn in the hieroglyphs and talked about for centuries after, it was us all along.",2,vampirelupus,True,t3_2and53,0,cj5ihwg,0,1434859142,

Severely regressive/flat tax items we have now:  
SS/payroll deductions that apply only to middle class work income.  
Certain investment income taxed at half the rate of work income.  
Sales and sin taxes aimed at collecting tax revenue from poor people.  
Gambling/lotteries aimed at extracting revenue from people poor at math.  
Benefit clawbacks and inelligibility based on income thresholds.

Replacing all taxes designed to raise revenue rather than discourage behaviour on social grounds with income taxes goes a long way to making it progressive.

The huge revenue booster of flat taxes would come from replacing payroll taxes with a higher income tax (0 effect on work income), and eliminating all tax preferences for investment.  (Investing can still earn more after tax than stuffing money in mattress).

UBI+Flat tax also by itself, significantly reduces overall tax rates for **[low and middle class incomes](http://jsfiddle.net/3bYTJ/11/)**.  $50k will pay 0 net tax.  You can view UBI, as everyone receiveing a refundable tax credit of $12k or $15k.

The group consists of 3 Ninjas and one slightly slower Spiritmaster. The goal is to get all four of them to be faster than than enemies but the Spiritmaster slower than the three Ninjas. That way the Ninjas can just attack and the Spiritmaster uses *Stillness* after that and the enemies don't get to cause damage. 

For support abilities you need to play around a bit. I can't remember which of the *Speed X% Up* support abilities you need to beat the enemies **SPD**.

Otherwise the Ranger's *Hawkeye* (1 slot, Accuracy +100%) causes that more of your attacks hit which in turn cause more damage (each attack command consists of up to 16 attacks that hit, the number of individual attack depends on your **AGI**) and the Ninja's *Frenetic Fighting* (2 slots, up to 32 attacks can hit with each attack command) which should cause even more damage.

The *Falcon Knife*'s and the *Hermes* equipments **AGI** boost increases your number of attack per attack command. So that means two *Falcon Knife*s for everyone (88230pg * 8). I can't exactly remember the relationstip between **AGI** and **SPD**. Which makes you attack first, add accuracy, increase number of hits, and increase evasion. That's why I wrote why I think (vaguely remember) you need the equipment.

Your Ninjas also get one  turn to default and collect a BP while Stillness is active. You can use that in your attack turn to  cast *Ikkikasei* and then attack (doubles the number of attacks) for even more damage (if needed).

That should give you a bit less than 60 000 damage per 2 turns (the Ninjas with two attack each that cause about 9999 damage) while staying alive (*Stillness* gives you one round of nothing to do).

Silver Tongue and Center of Commerce fit really well together. I am a great diplomat and can ensure a steady supply of essential and luxuries for my settlement. With my luck, I'll often be getting excellent deals. And if not there's always a chance I can gamble with traders for a better deal. People need something to entertain them after electricity, and gambling has been popular for thousands of years. Drugs and Alcohol is another option to keep people entertained and provide another source of trade good for actually useful items. The decent soil and water provided by my base choice will be invaluable for planting and harvesting food and drugs. The only negative from my choices is Silver Tongue making everyone of the opposite sex attracted to me. But even that has its uses for getting better deals with the caravans. The specific drugs I will be producing with my Drugs and Alcohol perk are: Penicillin, Tobacco, Mead (means I have access to honey resource), and ~~Absinthe~~ Opium. Though I would have prefered the green fairy, my followers will be providing their own strong liquor and drugs and I don't need to be adding additional ones to the mix just for the sake of it. *Edit:* I chose opium for the morphine aspect, for those confused. I understand it is more associated with hard drugs and my comment may have seemed strange.


I also am gaining an additional perk from selecting a flaw. **Beastmaster** isn't really that good, since it only gives me one animal and I have no way to purchase more from traders, since it's specifically prohibited. All the same it seems the only way to actually get an animal, and I suppose 1 egg a day is better than none. Still it would be nice to have multiple animals for stable milk/meat/egg. Unfortunately having only one animal makes it incredibly difficult to breed them. So I will take one loyal dog, smart enough to learn tricks and help guard the perimeter. Also helps boost morale.


**Buildings:**

Town Hall (cost 25) 

Tavern (cost 15)

Water Processing (cost 45)

Solar Array (cost 50)

Best Barricade (cost 30)

Clinic (20) doctor building

12 Houses (cost 7 each) 

Common House (15)

3 Stores (cost 7 each)


I choose most settlers primarily off of who I thought would make good company with a some consideration given to who would be assets to the settlement. Cory &amp; Trevor sound hilarious and I was disappointed that I couldn't choose them without having the RV.


**People:**

**Gordon Wey** , Mechanic &amp; Electrician

Cheerful and helpful.

**Riley Therka** Passionate Cook &amp; Gardener 

Entusiatic and useful for food production and preparation.

**Aldo Avicci** Gastronomist Extraordinaire

 Eccentric and skilled in the culinary arts.

**Xavier** - Medieval Arms Dealer &amp; Silver-worker 

Silver work is essential against supernatural beasts - a no-brainer choice.

**Kind Kim** - Friendly Neighbourhood Drug Dealer

Likeable and profitable. She won't be able to sell the more harmful drugs once her supply runs out, and that is just fine with me.

**Lux** - Full-Time Miracle Worker and Part-Time Doctor 

It sounds like she is some kind of paladin who heals whatever she touches. Also she isn't mean like the other doctor choices.

**Francesco** - Definitely Not A Stereotype

Possibly useless, but I like the access to fine clothes and he sounds like a character that will keep others entertained.

**Bubba** - Professional Hillbilly &amp; Moonshiner Extraordinaire 

Access to moonshine for fun and profit, and he also kills zombies. Also definitely not a stereotype.

**Emari Mcclellan** - The Dumb Jock (Which is also definitely not a stereotype)

Big, dumb, and can use most of the silver weapons provided by Xavier to kill werewolves for me. Hopefully gorgeous to make up for idiocy.

**Zack Holden** - Supporting Cast 

Murri's brother. No known personality. Was completely willing to join up and ditch younger sister.

**Murri Holden** - Supporting Cast Relation

Zack’s sibling, good with a gun - but even less personality known. Also willing to abandon brother to the deadly zombie wastes.

**Scot Fisher** - SPLINTER CELL?!?! 

Willing to train the Holdens to suck less at killing zombies. Very good at killing things stealthily.

**Katharine Howell** - The Battle-Scarred Badass 

Experienced and sensible, with excellent ability to fight off threats.


I plan to have Xavier treat that barbed wire with silver to stop any werewolves scaling the fence unharmed. The City Hall and tavern are two excellent community gathering areas, not sure what we'll name the town or the bar. Water and power are delightful luxuries. Everybody should have access to clean water, and any visitors to town are welcome to some free water from the tavern. If they want a lot of free water/food they're going to have to help work on the crops though. I took twelve two-bedroom houses even though I only have 13 followers. A gated community seems strange to me if it only has a few buildings in it. The Holden siblings will have to share a house, and I'll probably end up sharing with someone as well - hopefully there are some good looking people during the apocalypse. The common house will function as an inn, four beds available to weary travelers/merchants. The three stores will be for weapons, drugs &amp; alcohol, and general goods. Xavier handles the weapons, his silver expertise will make us a fortune, so long as we can keep bringing in silver to enhance weapons and ammunition. Kind Kim can sell her own drugs as well as Bubba's Shine and my stuff. I imagine penicillin and morphine will be in demand. Francesco will be selling our surplus grain and food, I'm not just letting him get away with collecting and restributing pretty outfits. If he want to get the latest designer threads and spend settlement money he better at least be doing something useful as well! At least I have a reliable doctor with access to penicillin and morphine.


I have 50 points leftover (30 from the original 500, 15 from my flaw). I would use it for additional secure farmland or farm animals. Nothing remaining on the list seems terribly useful to my current build though. Without considering my Green Thumb perk, which I hope allows me to start cultivating some foodstuffs ASAP, I already have Penicillin, Tobacco, Mead, Honey, Opium, Heroin, Morphine, Weed, Unspecified Psychedelics, Moonshine, and Meth (but hopefully she can't make that for long because I find it messes people up more often than not). It's apparently some kind of party town that all the traders want to come hang out at. Maybe they just cut me those deals so they can hang out in Drugsville.

My friends and I were basically coming off of collecting the Star Wars CCG (none of us actually played it, we just bought cards, opened packs hoping for sick rares worth money to trade to others, we all kinda became Star Wars fans after they re-released 4-6 in theatres at the time), and my friend had given me some random cards ranging from 4th ED, 5th ED, Legends, Ice Age, stuff around that time. 

To be frank, I'm pretty sure most of the cards sucked. However what got me into it was that instead of just collecting cards, there was actually a game that made sense and could be played around these cards. My friends actually taught me (mostly incorrectly in retrospect) how to play with rules like mana drop where we just dumped all our lands out T1 and didn't really get all the rules right (except combat, we figured all that out first) and we'd always try to setup decks that tried to kill early (we were all sick degenerates already, this is probably why Urza block where I first got sealed card packs is my favorite block of all time).

I didn't buy much Magic until I got my first issue of the Duelist from my parents as a gift. It was Duelist #40 with a promo alternate art Scent of Cinder. That magazine changed everything. At first, some of the articles appealed to the newbie, Timmy part of me and Thorn Elemental was the card I wanted the most. I found it hard to justify back then spending 7 bucks on a card when that would get me 2 boosters. (Oh how things have changed)

Upon reading the issue over and over and more in-depth each time. I learned nothing except degenerate ways to play Magic. After acquiring my first Thorn Elemental (i had opened maybe 15 boosters, no luck, my dad actually told me to stop wasting money on boosters and just buy the cards I wanted, it'd be cheaper. 'cheaper' XD) the next cards I set out to acquire were copies of Tolarian Academy after learning and becoming engrossed with absolutely devastating decks like Zvi Mowshowitz's Zero Effect cycling combo deck and Tinker-Wildfire decks that utterly dominated the most recent Block Constructed PT.

Since then my time with magic has varied with life, times I would play it lots, the stop for a while. Returned to the game in my last year of university, and have been as much as I can since.

1)  How to start a collection? 
 I have been reading some of the comments on here they say stay away from intro decks because they are too weak and not worth the money or that booster packs are better spent on singles.  I see lots on Ebay for 2000, 3000+ cards.  Is that a wise buy?  would it create a good base for me to build something.  Or maybe buy a core set?... I'm thinking about spending no more than $100 bucks to start this collection off.  (Modern format sounds appealing to me)

2)  Never been to a card shop to play.  
What should i expect?  Should i attend a FNM for my first time?  I have a feeling that I wont know what I'm doing.  Should i buy some cards there and make a deck out of it?  Will people get pissed off for playing with a noob?  How much money should I bring?  Will everyone be kicking my ass?

I don't think anyone is looking for the power 9 to be available for $2 each, but would a reasonably expensive collector's set for people to play Vintage or put into their cubes be so unreasonable if they were new art with modern frames (so that the collectable factor would still exist for the old versions)?

Now, common ones can be double that, and the truly rare ones much more - I saw a R-9 (2-4 examples known) one at a show this past weekend for $1100, for instance, although a decade ago I picked up a couple of R-8s and R-9s for around $100 each (curious if those have jumped in price as much, now that I'm thinking about it...).

&gt;Hey guys,

&gt;Just wanted to post some very quick early sketches we've done for an alternative loot beam.

&gt;We can't choose, so let us know which one you like best!! 

&gt;'Do all of them' isn't useful :p - if only we had time!

&gt;[Lootbeam Concepts](http://i.imgur.com/vFCTepA.png)

**- Update 27/06/2014**

&gt;The Ninja team are now full speed ahead with Boss Slayer!!!

&gt;For those paying attention, the two polls we had up last week are now closed. Results have determined that Death will be the representing NPC and the title unlock for killing all the bosses incorporated in Boss Slayer will be ""_ the Reaper""; which is nice as the two go quite well together.

&gt;Ana put some quick concepts for a new lootbeam (see above) on the forums, twitter, and reddit. We've kept an eye on what people have said, and it would appear a majority thought that the rainbow was the best. As such, this will be an unlockable reward through Boss Slayer.

&gt;Labl has started work on Death's office, the place you'll be going to receive your daily Boss Slayer task. Below is an early work in progress model of the area:

&gt;[Death's Office](http://i.imgur.com/w3WFNGo.png)

&gt;*(everything is still greybox so it is subject to change)*

&gt;Asherz has been working on a new interface which will display all the bosses available in Boss Slayer with total kills, fastest kill, available drops, as well as some other information. You'll also be able to see a variety of other monster kill counts on the interface as well.

&gt;That's all for this week... You stay classy Gielinor!

**- Update 04/07/2014**

&gt;This week we've made a bit of a change to the face of the project. Now that Death has been voted in as the representing NPC, we decided to theme it a bit more around him and not so much existing Slayer.

&gt;Don’t worry, this won't change anything that we currently have planned, it just means instead of being **assigned** something, you're told to **reap** them instead. The implication being that you collect the souls of the monsters you kill for Death. This is something we're pretty excited about, it made sense to make the change, giving the content much more depth and context in game.

&gt;We mentioned before that we were going to be putting out a pre-release for this project which consisted of boss and monster kill tracking, as well as instanced boss kill timers. Asherz has been working away at getting this sorted as quick as he can so it can be put into game ASAP. This will give you a nice little head start at killing bosses, not only for practice but also towards some of the unlockable rewards going out with the main release a few weeks later.

&gt;Labl is still working away at the 3D environment for Death's office, and it's starting to look hawt! What do you think of this work in progress?

&gt;[Death's Office](http://i.imgur.com/JV3IuSd.png)

&gt;*(currently using Death's old model as a placeholder - also, Roddeck army not included)*

&gt;Ana has been putting some concepts together for one of the rewards that we haven't mentioned yet. I think we'll keep this one up our sleeves for a little while longer as it's pretty darn juicy. 

&gt;Stu O has managed to get his claws on a new Kalphite Queen model which he’s now bringing to life with some fresh animations. We’ll be adding this to our main release as a nice little booster. Again, let us know you think.

&gt;[New Kalphite Queen Model](http://imgur.com/a/ZrY19)

&gt;Finally, we've seen a few people asking for an ETA for this update. We're currently looking to have the pre-release ready to go out towards the end of this month and the actual release should be around the middle of August. This can obviously change but they're our expected release times for those that wanted to know. Quite annoying having to wait but it should definitely be worth it. 


**- Update 14/07/2014**

&gt;The team have been continuing with what was mentioned in the last update; Stu O animating the Kalphite Queen, Labl on the 3D environment for Death's Office, leaving Ana and Asherz on the content side of the pre-release.

&gt;As previously mentioned the pre-release should be with you in the next few weeks; here is what we'll be putting out:

&gt;* **Boss Timers** - these are basically stopwatches which you can view during boss fights. They will only appear in instanced fights with a set group size selected, depending on the boss. When the main release comes out you will be able to view your personal best times for each boss.
* **Boss Kill Tracking** - this will track your boss kills in the background, but you won't be able to see how many until the main release comes out.
* **Slayer Monster Tracking** - the same as boss kill tracking but for a select group of slayer creatures that we were able to fit into the update. More creatures may be able to be tracked later, see our current list in the picture below.

&gt;For the Completionists out there, and those aiming for it, here are the new requirements that we're looking to add with the main updates release:

&gt;* **Completionist** - Kill all bosses to unlock ""_ the Reaper"" title, which will be lost whenever a new boss comes out. All the current bosses are bullet-pointed in the update made on 19/06/2014 on the first post of this thread.
* **Trimmed Completionist** - Unlock all permanent rewards through Boss Slayer. This is a time trial more than anything else, I guess depending on how good you are at bossing will determine how quickly you'll be able to complete this requirement.

&gt;*Note: as kills are tracked with the pre-release, players can work towards the Completionist unlock from that update. Bosses killed before this update will not count towards the achievement. However, we do have existing achievements in-game which will allow us to give players one kill on certain bosses (Barrows &amp; Rots, Fight Caves, Fight Kiln, all GWD, QBD and Vorago including Hardmode) when the pre-release goes live.* 

&gt;Finally, we know you like looking at a few pictures so here are some more sneak peeks from the main release:

&gt;[Death's Office](http://i.imgur.com/TG0OJxB.jpg)

&gt;*Starting to come together really nicely but still a bit off completion, says Labl*


&gt;[Slayer Creatures](http://i.imgur.com/wf5soRQ.png)

&gt;*No kills = #noob*


&gt;[Incomplete Hydrix](http://i.imgur.com/cs7Keh3.png)

&gt;*...and what could this be?*

**- Update 22/07/2014**

&gt;The pre-release for Boss Slayer is now live!

&gt;We hope you enjoy the new timers and the comfort of knowing that your boss and creature kills are now being tracked. These features will hopefully create some healthy competition between players and we'll no doubt be developing some seasonal hiscores with them in mind in the not too distant future. 

&gt;With this now in the game you'll be able to start working towards some of the rewards that come with the main Boss Slayer update. For those aiming for the previously mentioned Completionist requirements, you'll now be able to do so. With the main release you’ll be able to see the information we’re now tracking in a new pane created by Asherz which will appear within the Adventurers interface. 

&gt;We've also done our best to backtrack whether some of the bosses have already been killed by players based on the data we had stored. If we could prove that a player had killed a boss at least once we gave them a kill, which we thought would help those that wouldn't want to replay a particular boss. Here is a list of the bosses we've backtracked and the requirement to be given a kill:

&gt;* **Barrows** - Checks if the player has obtained the Barrows icon during the Temple of Senntisten quest.
* **Barrows: Rise of the Six** - Checks that Barrows: Rise of the Six has been completed.
* **Commander Zilyana** - Checks if the player has obtained the Saradomin lore book.
* **General Graardor** - Checks if the player has obtained the Bandos lore book.
* **Har-aken** - Completion of the Fight Kiln.
* **Kree'arra** - Checks if the player has obtained the Armadyl lore book.
* **K'ril Tsutsaroth** - Checks if the player has obtained the Zamorak lore book.
* **Nex** - Checks if the player has obtained the Nex lore book.
* **Queen Black Dragon** - Obtained the first Dragonkin journal.
* **TzTok-Jad** - Completion of the Fight Caves, or sacrificed a fire cape.
* **Vorago** - Checks that Vorago has been mauled personally.
* **Vorago (Hardmode)** - Checks if the player has unlocked '_ the Defeater' title.


&gt;Now for an exclusive! Here's a cosmetic override set that you'll be able to earn piece-by-piece for killing certain amounts of bosses. Let me just warn you, this won't be easy to obtain, only those that are true masters of PvM will be able to unlock it. Ana has done an awesome job in the concept, tying in elements from the bosses of Gielinor into one truly epic outfit. What do you think?

&gt;[Boss Slayer Reward Outfit](http://i.imgur.com/kHcbW8f.jpg)

&gt;Also on the development side of things, Labl has now finished Death's office! No picture this time as we want the final form to be a surprise on release. You'll be able to travel to this area through a portal in Draynor, right next to the lodestone for easy access. Labls next challenge will be to model the remaining reward items, including the outfit above, expect to see development on this in the coming weeks. Stu is polishing off his animation work on the updated Kalphite Queen model, and he’ll also be moving on to something new, animating Death in his new office.

1. **The opening had way better visuals.** The first one yes, but there's multiple seasons of both.

2. **All Digimon talk, and Pokémon only has Meowth.** That's not necessarily an issue. That and there were other talking pokemon in certain episodes (a specific Ghastly in one of the early ones, Mewtwo, etc). That and it made the few episodes where you did see the Pokemon talking to each other with subtitles seem more special.

3. **Digivice came in colors and had more purposes than the Pokédex.** The Pokedex and the Digivice aren't the same sort of thing though. The Pokedex is basically what Izzy's laptop computer was in the first season. The Digivice is basically a combination item-dispenser, power booster, and Pokeball (Digiball?).

4. **Evolution was not permanent and you didn’t have to train for it.** ... that's not necessarily a good thing. It made the evolution feel less like a major achievement and more like Sailor Moon with fur and scales. That and it would cut out a huge chunk of the episode for all the various digivolution sequences.

5. **Characters had more depth to them and you could identify with more than just three.** Yeah, I'll give it that... but then the Pokemon anime was really only ever made for one reason: To sell more Pokemon merch. It wasn't trying to be a good series, it was basically a half-hour long advertisement. Mind you this is also why I stopped giving a shit about Pokemon midway through the Johto series, but made a point of getting up early every Saturday to watch the newest episode of Digimon season 3.

6. **The characters were not selfish and had meaning to their actions.** See above.

7. **The crests had more value and were prettier than gym badges.** Only in the anime really. In the manga [Pokemon Adventures](http://www.mangahere.co/manga/pokemon_adventures/) which is superior to the Pokemon anime in *every* way (my opinion but dammit I'm sticking to it) the gym badges actually have some sort of supernatural power and are even sought out by Team Rocket as part of their plot to take over the Kanto region.

8. **The villains scared the shit out of you.** Indeed, but then the villains of Digimon had the advantage of, well, being Digimon. Human villains are constrained by the fact that they're still human and Pokemon is constrained by the fact that it's more aimed at younger kids... but yes I will never forget Myotismon and all his reincarnations (especially that bit at the end of Season 2. That series gets fucking *dark*). Besides, even in the games the villains are a mixed bag at best. Archie and Maxie are just deluded and even regret what they've done at the end, Cyrus is just a nutter with a god complex, N is... well... N (lets be honest, Gethis was the real villain there. N was just a figurehead), and Lysandre was... well... I'm not sure *what* his deal was.

9. **Shit got real.** Yeah, but again, younger audience means lighter tone. You won't see any characters getting bumped off in Spongebob Squarepants either. Mind you they did at least get in their share of 'oh shit' moments in the original series. Ash almost got pecked to death by a flock of Spearow in the first episode, the entire group wound up trapped in a sunken ship and almost died when the St. Anne sunk, and so on... but then these were the early episodes and they hadn't quite turned it into a total cash cow yet either.

10. **There was actual storytelling.** Again, the Pokemon anime wasn't intending to do more than sell more toys. They did have at least a sort of overreaching storyline though in that Ash would get more gym badges, collect pokemon, and so on... Just think of it as a really small story with an absolutely obscene amount of filler episodes.

11. **The cliff-hangers left you with extreme anxiety.** ... oh god I thought I'd blocked out those memories of 'Scary Jeri'. ._.; I need to go curl up and have a good cry now.

12. **The characters were not immortal.** I'm just going to skip this one. The internet has made more than enough memes about Ash being stuck as a ten year old forever.

13. **You can become the Digimon, which is badass.** Um... [about that...](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Burst). It hasn't shown up in the west yet (and seriously Nintendo, *why* hasn't it shown up in the west yet?!) but there is a manga where Pokemon/Human fusion does take place, constantly, and is the major driving story point.

14. **New monsters are just way cooler and original.** Oddly enough I've heard this argument in both directions. The detractors of Digimon saying that every other digimon is just an animal wearing body armor and lots of guns. Personally... I think there's good and bad for both. For every Digimon as well designed as [Renamon](http://dma.wtw-x.net/DMA/DigimonStands/Toei/Seppi/Renamon.jpg) you'll get one as bizarrely designed as, say, [Nanimon](http://dma.wtw-x.net/DMA/DigimonStands/Toei/Nanimon.gif) who is just... I don't even know what the hell that thing is supposed to be. For every Pokemon who's as well designed as [Greninja](http://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/6/67/658Greninja.png/250px-658Greninja.png) (I didn't even realize his ninja scarf was actually his tongue until a month after X and Y were out...) you'll get a [Vanilluxe](http://pldh.net/media/dreamworld/584.png) who looks like the new mascot for Dairy Queen.

15. **It can actually happen if you think about it.** Um... no. Maybe as a virtual reality thing, but then you could say the same exact thing about pokemon too. Either one would be amazing (and knowing the internet, used for some really disturbing pornography), but we will not have Greymon stomping around Tokyo some day despite how awesome that would be.

16. **It actually ends, and man, it’s a great ending!** This one I'll concede to. One of the things that made me lose interest in the Pokemon anime is that despite having [a whole roster of trainers](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130320154941/ssb4-wiki-ita/images/f/f3/Pokemon_trainers_by_zettoshonen-d4yoqkv.png) to use as a main character they only ever use Ash and company and just keep what is essentially the first season going unto infinity. The only times I even got interested in the series again were [Pokemon Chronicles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Chronicles) which was a miniseries and even then still focused on Ash 'why haven't my balls dropped yet' Ketchum and his pokemon half the time and that recent reboot they did titled [Pokemon Origins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Origins) which was a lot more like the Pokemon Adventures manga I mentioned above but only lasted for four damn episodes.

But yeah. The Digimon anime is better than Pokemon, but when you get right down to it the reasons aren't about which had the cooler monsters or which had the better tech.

Digimon just had several advantages:

- Aimed at a more mature audience so they could do stories that had the opportunity to be darker, more challenging, and have some opportunities for really gripping moments. (Preteen and young teens VS small children)

- Better written characters who showed emotion more and actually had to deal with loss and conflict outside of what could be easily resolved in a 30 minute episode.

- Knowing when to quit and end a story before it just got ridiculous and started recycling episodes.

But then when it comes to Pokemon I stopped giving a crap about the anime a long time ago. I still play the games, but then the situation is reversed for the two 'Mon rivals. Pokemon games are still engaging, well made, and still manage to at least put in some new gameplay for each new generation (Trainer customization, Pokemonamie, and Super Training in X&amp;Y, the Pokemon Dream World in Black &amp; White, the mining minigame in DPPt, Pokemon Contests and Secret Bases in RSE, and so on) while most of the Digimon games I've played have been pretty disappointing, very poorly translated, and just ripped off the much better Anime (the MMO was especially disappointing).

If you want a good game, go Pokemon. If you want an anime with good characters and a story that still gets to me like it did when I was fourteen even though I'm now almost thirty, go with Digimon.

**TL;DR: The Digimon anime is the better anime, but its because it was better written and had more interesting characters more than anything else.**",5,gamerlen,True,t3_2bdbc1,0,cj4f1ua,0,1434839347,

&gt; The article does point to problems with the market at such an oversupply (lots of investor owned units make things unstable, and people are having a harder time obtaining mortgages even after a down payment) but I sincerely hope that things go well there.

I think there exist no large operations without downsides. Toronto's condo boom isn't without its problems, but the major impact it has on Toronto is probably something that SF could really use. When it comes to investor-owned units, I'm pretty sure that's a major problem our luxury condos here face as well. My naive mind wants to think that we only need some anti-vacancy policy that forces even investor units to be rented out (and thus contributes to supply), but chances are there are problems with that in practice that I'm not aware of (although I'd love it if someone with expertise has an explanation).

I should also mention that Toronto's cost of living is very reasonable. From personal experience and from knowing many people who live there, I can attest that Toronto is a place where middle-class teachers and researchers can afford apartments in safe, transit-enabled neighborhoods very close to downtown, and young professionals (of the more lucrative fields like finance, accounting, engineering, etc...) can afford lakeside 1-bedroom highrise condo units right out of college. Of course, cost of living is really hard to compare from one place to the next (so many different factors), but I'd like to think Toronto's lack of aversion towards density and construction has had a substantial impact in preventing cost of living from skyrocketing. After all, it is not a city in decline like Detroit or St. Louis, it is a city with a large and diverse economy, high livability rankings, and world status.

&gt; They are a much larger city (4x the population of SF) with more area to work with, so it is a little easier.

Yep, I fully agree. However, note that the GTA is not a larger metro than the Bay Area. If you just look at population over land with no regard to political borders, the Toronto Area is not much different from the Bay Area. This shows that the difference is solely political, where the Bay Area is fragmented into many small entities. I believe this fragmentation is actually very hurtful for the Bay Area as a whole (just look at our state of many different transit systems mashed together, where an Oakland to SF trip can easily cross 3 systems (AC Transit-BART-MUNI) and require 3 fares), and that even if an annexation of surrounding cities is politically unfeasible today, it would still be great for some collective regional efforts to be taken seriously by many different cities, in order to tackle these large regional problems.

&gt; Also, yes, Vancouver is very nice, Ive been there. I can tell however from that photo that it probably doesn't have nearly the diversity of character that SF has with it's cozy and human-scale neighborhoods. I like those neighborhoods a lot and so do most of the residents here, which is why many people are reluctant to just let them go for the sake of progress.

My first reaction to this is *why not both?* Even if we assume Vancouver isn't what we want (I don't think either of us can judge Vancouver's character well since neither of us have lived there for long periods of time... or perhaps you have?), we *don't have to be Vancouver*. Why can't we take only Vancouver's good things while keeping SF's own?

Or, why not offer a choice? Some people might like smaller scaled neighborhoods, others may not. If SF is full of smaller scaled neighborhoods that you enjoy, can you no longer enjoy the many remaining smaller scaled neighborhoods if some of them were changed to larger ones? Meanwhile, those seeking a more metropolitan lifestyle would find that SF has something for them too. (A friend of mine who came here from Nanjing, China, was incredibly surprised at first that San Francisco is actually so much smaller than she imagined.)

To me, human-scale means places with a lot of potential social interactions. It means neighborhood vibrancy, and plenty of people noise, where you can easily get a sense of the humanity surrounding you. It means a place that meets every possible human need where people can feel comfortable living in all kinds of different lifestyles. Human-scale doesn't mean isolated houses, shops that close early forcing you to stay at home, sleepy neighborhoods where you barely see people out and about, or people passing by in the isolation of their cars. In these aspects, SF is much better than your typical sprawl towns or second-tier metros, but still a step short of bigger metros, and certainly far from the ideal. I also believe culture, diversity, population density, and cost of living are all intimately related. To get great culture, you need to get huge numbers (comes with population) of very diverse people (made possible with reasonable cost of living, boosted by comfortable support of many different lifestyles) to interact with each other (comes with density). If you look at the world at large, places of great culture tend to be large population centers that are highly free, open, and livable by anyone regardless of whether you're a millionaire businessman or a minimum-wage worker. Even SF is known for its culture not because it's small, but because it's one of the greater cities in the world.

So I guess I don't see growing SF into a bigger city is merely ""for the sake of progress."" Instead, given the housing constraint and the risk of losing diversity from it, I think growing SF is crucial in keeping and improving SF's level of human-scale and overall culture. Quaint little cozy neighborhoods are meaningless when the only ones who can live among them are the social elite. You want to keep artists and musicians? Then you've gotta make sure there are places to live that they can afford. Meanwhile, it's not like growing into a bigger city will completely change SF's facade. An SF that's 25% bigger would still be at least 60-80% in common with the old SF, if not more (and there will still be plenty of cozy neighborhoods). Meanwhile, in a world with global forces pushing us left and right, if your size doesn't change over time, then your contents almost certainly will.

But of course, a lot of these preferences are personal and can be understandably irrational even (we like what we like, and we can't deny that, right?). These are merely my own personal opinions. YMMV.",6,ltristain,True,t3_2bbe19,0,cj48vz0,0,1434835890,

1)  When you buy an ""outdoor"" antenna, and set it up indoors, it will almost never reach its advertised signal ""gain"".  It has to do with the walls &amp; wiring in the way of the signal (and not being ""elevated"" from the ground clutter).

2)  You're going to need roughly a 20 dBi boost in reception signal to ""reliably"" receive NBC.  The ClearStream maxes out at roughly +10 dBi.  That doesn't put you in the green level of signal strength.  As I said, I never had any luck with the fancy shmancy, tiny indoor antennas specially made for UHF.  I've seen a few get a slightly better signal than a rabbit ears/loop combination, and that's it.

3)  The only thing I could tell you with confidence is that if you got one of these [monsters](https://www.antennasdirect.com/store/DB8e-Ultra-Long-Range-Outdoor-DTV-Antenna.html) setup on a roof, you'd be almost guaranteed to get the stations you want.

4)  Don't think you can make up for the signal loss with a pre-amplifier.  They're even a sketchier deal than the antennas.  The more antenna surface area (&amp; proper design), the better chance of collecting enough TV signal to get a picture.

5)  You said you didn't want to ""waste"" a lot of money.  So, I'd give up, based on what you said.  Or, if you can construct a quad Grey-Hoverman for beer money, and live with losing out on the beer, that's the other option.

You can make many structures and carry them with you if you cancel the build. One of them is the meat effigy. Shave for beard hair if you're Wilson, or if not, consider going on a crazy frenzy and collecting evil bunnies for it, and to carry a stack with you for the duration of your adventure. 

Give yourself plenty of options for when you collect the things. I like to bring a couple of meaty stews or something that fills you up for over a day, and also lots of jerky or other sanity boost, in case you come across a challenge involving sanity. 

You rarely have to fight. Kill the walrus until you can get a walking stick. After that, the only time you should have no choice but to fight is to kill the clock pieces, or koalaphants. Wear football helmets and log suits whenever you do battle, because many of the obstacles are tougher to survive than sandbox. 

The different chapters are far more harsh than sandbox. If you're well-prepared, you may want to rush through some of the worlds, collect the things, and bugger-out. If you can, great. But, have a fallback location to resupply, and even settle for a bit if necessary. The adventure can play like a marathon sometimes though, because every decision can mean the end of many hours of effort. Be prepared to grind out a chapter for quite awhile if the world doesn't give you enough of a particular resource. I was stuck once on a chapter with barely any flint. I actually wound up making an alchemy engine so I could make gold tools before I was able to cut down any rocks, and had to find an axe along the way for wood.

I'm now currently up to 8 binders (one or two per generation depending on how many sets it had). Anyways here's some pointers from my mistakes/lessons learned.

* Buy large bulk orders of commons/uncommons, you can even try over at /r/pkmntcgtrades and see what you can get for cheap. I even have a crap ton of extra cards now (two 5k boxes full) if you want to pm me later.

* DO NOT buy single booster packs at big retail stores, they charge about $4.25+. You get a much better value buying either singles or finding a card shop since most of them will sell at 3 for $10. I even found older booster boxes of HG/SS, Platinum, BW sets on Dacardworld for about $85-90 (about $2.75 a pack) and knocked out huge portions of my collection that way. Plus it gave me a bunch of trade-able cards that way too.

* Stick to either regular or RH cards, and when you get the RH version just replace the other card in the binder; if it comes in RH and reg holo I keep both in the same slot. Unless you really want to have two collections going but that will take forever to finish.

* Don't get too ambitious, this was my biggest mistake, take it slow. Remember that you're looking to collect over 6,000 cards so don't expect it all to be done in a few weeks. This is going to be a long drawn out process. I was spending close to $200 a week just buying everything I could find and burnt through all my play money in just about 2 months.

* Try to stick to one set at a time, this way you have a clear goal in mind otherwise it becomes very overwhelming. Find a check list online to use also because you'll find it very hard to keep track of everything otherwise. Also save all the really expensive cards (FAs, SRs, Gold Stars, etc) till the end.

* Last but not least, dont shy from trading. Take your binder to your local pokemon league, or over to /r/pkmntcgtrades and trade extras of cards you dont need for ones you do.

So, when you receive a gift from someone, do you review it as ""well, you could have afforded better?"" given their circumstances?

I was taught to be happy with what is given to you.

The reality is, these people actually owe you nothing. Getting anything from anyone for free, as a gift, is a nice gesture. Evaluating they could have spent more is more rude, in my opinion.

We are, basically, discussing compassion, here, and providing gifts and money isn't always the best thing to do. For instance, handing someone who abuses alcohol 10K may just enable them to drink 10K worth of alcohol versus getting help.

Help comes in forms beyond finances. Anyone can throw money at a problem but less will be there to physically help.

&gt;""showing a readiness to give more of something, as money or time, than is strictly necessary or expected.""

If a rich person attends a gathering and then sticks around to help wash dishes while everyone else leaves, is he a bad person since he didn't pay for everything, pay for a maid to clean it, etc.? I don't think so, no. 

Do you expect more from this situation? How come the others don't owe anything? It seems to be a financial matter.

&gt;Giving above a certain amount can serve as cheap advertising for those donating and serves to increase their reputation with the public.

I agree, but how can one prove this? Bill Gates is helping people, is he doing it to boost his reputation? 

As well, in this case, does the means justify the ends? No one is getting hurt and people are being helped. It's positive propaganda, so to speak.

&gt;Someone making in excess of 8 figures certainly lives a very comfortable life, even if they can't afford that 2nd private jet they were drooling over.

And you're talking about charity but ignoring the economics of this. I will just focus on this since it gets severely lost when talking about rich people.

First, I will iterate that rich people do not create jobs. They do not create demand, etc. At least, no more than anyone (but of the collective).

Secondly, to use their life, they buy a home. Many people had a job to build it from resources to management to builders. That private jet? That employed people at a jet factory, from designers to resource collectors to management, again. It is stored at an airport that earns money, maintained by mechanics, flown by pilots, and operated by staff.

What we tend to focus on is that rich people have stuff. What we ignore is that people work, as a result. Again, rich people do not create jobs, but when they go a buy a jet, that employs a lot of people.

This is BEYOND their investments into companies and what nots. 

Rich people do give but because they have a lot, some of us we think they should give a lot. Some of us are thankful for what they provide, some of us spit at it and demand more.

One thing I have struggled with, and the left wing is severely more guilty, is why demanding free stuff from rich people, or Government, isn't greedy. It's not your stuff.",32,UrbanZenMonk,True,t3_2bag31,0,cj3dkmc,0,1434820238,

They don't care about where their stuff is sourced from, they don't care about contributing to academia and public understanding of history. I think they get a sad ego boosts from chasing their Indiana Jones fantasy and are a net minus to wider society. The private collecting market is the root cause of illegal excavation, which leads to loss of context, the enrichment of criminal groups and surging production of forgeries.

Private collecting might have been justifiable in previous centuries, before publicly accessible museums came to be but times have changed. Private collectors are either ignorant of the damage they cause, directly or indirectly, or they simply don't give a fuck.

If this were not /r/askhistorians I would be employing more colourful language in this post.

Firstly, from Etsy's help: What are tags - www.etsy.com/help/article/69 Extract: ""A tag is a word or short phrase that describes your item. Etsy matches tags with shoppers' searches to find relevant search results."". There are other useful tidbits in the help information. 

You can do research on Etsy right in Etsy's search bar - just start typing and popular suggestions appear. You can also most popular keywords in Etsy's Advertising Ads ( https://www.etsy.com/au/help/article/1036 ). Then you can use a tool like: www.tools4etsy.com/Wall-e/Relevancy/Keyword to see where you appear in search + who the top sellers are, the top listings, and the Tags used.

** Titles &amp; Tags are important to Etsy Search (redundancy = relevancy i.e. Tag phrases should be repeated in titles); Description &amp; Titles for SEO (repetition = relevancy, but not duplication; i.e. Titles, each should be unique). Title, Tag and Description (upper/lower) case &amp; punctuation has no importance to Etsy Search &amp; Search Engines like Google &amp; Bing (SEO). Also, the order of Tags is not important.

** You need to choose descriptive keywords for your titles and very important in placing the strongest words first with Etsy relevancy as ""Words that appear at the beginning of your title are given more weight"" &amp; ""Exact word pairs are given more weight"" (https://www.etsy.com/teams/7718/questions/discuss/8755739/page/1?post_id=95252847 )! Another reason to front-load your keywords is that Google only displays up to 66 characters of a title in search results, and Etsy's search also only displays approximately 30~40 characters in Gallery mode, so putting the most important words first will help attract the right shoppers as they poke around. Also check out the Etsy 2014 Seller Seminar workbook (page 20: https://etsy.app.box.com/s/wn778l32ztm9pararbl5 ) - ""Put the most descriptive words at the front of your titles and tags"". 

** Be aware that Etsy sees Categories as having a dual purpose - both as a Category &amp; a Tag. Entering them twice is a waste of a tag.

** According to an Etsy Blog article (ref: blog.etsy.com/en/2013/top-5-steps-to-a-mobile-friendly-shop ): ""...item descriptions are truncated on Etsy’s mobile apps after nine lines; aim to keep vital details above the fold."".

It can be a bit temperamental when setting up extra controllers and the initial controls but once you get going it's such a blast. It's in alpha but it's completely free (at the moment, not sure if that is subject to change). You can play it as a silly, competitive fighting game or just a way to mess around with friends. It's quite limited with the amount of content but the quality of content is enough to keep you amused for hours on end even on the same map.

If you can get any of the **Left 4 Dead** games there is a way you can make them [splitscreen](http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1029890) on the PC so that might be enough.

**BattleBlock Theatre** is a fun co-op platformer game and that can be played locally with controllers. It's incredibly funny with loads to collect and can be quite challenging at parts. It has incredibly simple controls with incredibly simple mechanics and can really test your friendship and you push your buddy off a ledge rather than giving him a boost up to the next. The same co-op system applies for **Castle Crashers** which you've probably heard of.

If you don't mind a bit of childish humour then the **LEGO** games are probably the best out there for co-op. Childish, simple, fun with so much to collect and so many reasons to replay each level. There are so many themes: Batman, Marvel, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean, Indiana Jones. You're more than likely to find one you like.

The last couple I can think of are **Magicka** which is probably the funniest game I've ever played, it has a real Monty Python sense of humour to it. You combine elements to make different spells and fight your way through the levels. The other is **Trine** which is a 2D platformer where you can play as the thief, mage or knight each with their own unique abilities to really emphasise the teamwork aspect.

A few days ago we silently changed Process Street’s pricing model for all new users from freemium to a 30 day free trial. At the same time we increased the price on all of our plans except the entry 10 user plan (now Premium 10). Today, we announced to our users that we’re no longer offering the free plan, and that everyone who is currently using the free plan will be switched to a 30 day trial of our Premium 10 plan.

During the trial users have complete, unhindered access to test Process Street. They can create as many templates, teams and jobs as they want, plus upgrade to any of the plans free of charge. At the end of the 30 days they must decide if they want to continue using the product as a paid user or not.
All of our paying customers on plans larger than 10 users, will remain on their current plan with no changes unless they choose to upgrade/downgrade, in which case they’ll be moved to the new pricing model.

In this post, I’ll explain why we chose to change from freemium to free trial.

**Why Freemium in the First Place?**

There were a couple of reason we decided to launch Process Street on a freemium model. First, the initial product simply wasn’t ready for paying users.  When Process Street first launched it was extremely basic. As such, we didn’t believe we could attract enough paying users for the product when it was missing so many critical features (in fact, we didn’t even have billing in place so we couldn’t have charged them if we wanted to!) However, we knew we needed to have enough users so we could talk to them and gather feedback to improve the product. We felt that a freemium model would be a good way to accomplish that.
We were also users of a few freemium products that we enjoyed and received a great deal of value from such as Evernote, Dropbox and Asana. The success of these products blinded us a little as we followed suit.

Freemium can be a great business model especially if your product has consumer appeal. The biggest benefit of going freemium is that it lowers the cost of customer acquisition, and that, combined with our need for users, were reasons enough to convince us to take the plunge. We have since learned there is a lot of evidence against freemium, and a quick search for “freemium vs free trial” on Google sheds can be illuminating.
The Freemium Results
Our conversion rate to date from freemium to paid has been 0.72%, less than 1%! That number is not great by any means, with most freemium products sitting between the 1-5% range (2-3% is a GREAT result for a freemium product).

I feel our stats are skewed however… Since we first launched our MVP on November 14, we’ve developed the product significantly. The initial product was bare bones when we launched, not even having a way to reset your password. The 0.72% figure is an average of all our signups starting from launch, and thus not very accurate. Since then, we have listened to hundreds of ideas and problems from customers and worked hard to build them into the product. As a result, have seen our conversation rate boosted.
For example, in the last 30 days, our conversion rate from freemium to paid has been 1.8%, a much better number but still not as high as we would like. Solid SaaS companies like Groove are seeing 10% conversion rates on their free trials… the kinds of numbers we’re going after!

**Why Drop the Free Plan?**

We are changing our business model for three reasons. Firstly, the free plan was limiting the extent to which our users could test the product. Process Street is built for teams, as one doesn’t really document processes for themselves. Usually, it’s something done for training or scaling an organization.

The same goes for number of processes. Generally, teams have more than 5 processes (the limit on our free plan). As a result, we were receiving feedback from our users that they had bigger teams and needed more documents to be able to test the product properly.
The second reason is that our product has significantly evolved since our initial release. Since we’re offering much more value now than when we first launched, we feel comfortable charging people, even for lower volume users.
Finally, this change is a test to see if it increases our revenues. I’m not going to lie, we run a business. We’ve spent more than a year and a lot of money building it, and we’re not trying to give it away for free. Not that we’re against giving away stuff for free, but at this point in time we’re most interested in increasing revenues and we believe this is one of the highest potential return tests we can run.

**Why 30 days and not 14?**

We decided to go with a 30 day trial based on data we’ve collected from our app since launch. We’ve noticed that it takes many of our users some time to get deep into our app and activate properly. The reason for this is our app requires a significant time investment before it can be used effectively. Our product is a documentation tool to help busy managers run their teams efficiently. This can be a bit of a catch-22, as it’s not easy for busy managers to find the time to create detailed process documents while they’re busy putting out fires in their day job. They know it’s important, but it tends to be put further down the list than major catastrophes and revenue generating activities.

This has lead to us having some slow conversions on our freemium product (people converting 6 months later because they just didn’t have the time to get around to their documentation). Because of this, we thought we should give our user more time to get familiar with the product.

Maybe this assumption is wrong, and maybe a 14 day trial would encourage people to pull out their credit card even if they haven’t tested the product fully. This is something we’re considering testing in the future, but for now, 30 days is what we’re going with.

**Why the Price Increase?**

We increased the price on the larger plans for reasons 2 and 3 above, plus a couple of others.
First, our customers told us our pricing was low. Some people don’t get our product, they look at it and say “how is that different to Asana”. However, people who manage large teams and have an issue keeping everyone on the same page really understand just how big of a problem it can be, and how valuable a solution is.

For example, increasing the productivity of a 40 person team by 10% is worth a hell of a lot more than $100 a month (what we were charging with our previous pricing). Even if they’re unskilled workers making $1,500 a month (which none of our customers are) its still a $6,000 a month increase in productivity. Bring the salaries up to $100k and that number skyrockets. A few of our customers said they would happily pay more to see those kinds of returns on their teams productivity and it totally makes sense.
Secondly, larger teams use more resources, require lengthy onboarding and more intensive support. To be able to service our these customers better, we need to charge a little more.

We know this is a pretty big change for our free users, and we are sorry if it causes you or your business any issues. If this is the case, we would love to hear from you, either through our in-app support system or here in the comments.

&gt; Had a system of land value tax (LVT) been in place, the house price bubble, as it turned out to be, would never have grown to the extent that it did, and not at all had the availability of credit been properly regulated. First, the escalating market value of land, the main component in the huge increase in house prices, would have been kept under control, because the bulk of the increase in land values would have been collected as LVT. Next, it would have eliminated the speculative element that has pushed up prices, since it would have made no economic sense to withhold land from the market in the expectation of higher prices later, first because with LVT in place, such price rises would hardly have occurred, and second because landowners would have been penalised by having to pay LVT.
&gt; Furthermore, owners of land, once they had received planning permission, would have had the incentive to develop the land for housing as rapidly as possible. It would have ended the practice of house builders holding large land banks out of use for decades. In other words, it would have boosted the supply of housing, and dampened the tendency for house prices to rise.
&gt; Finally, lower land prices would have made it more affordable for local authorities and housing associations to acquire land for social housing, thus increasing the supply of accommodation at affordable rents. In addition, the greater availability of social housing would have meant that private landlords would have been less able to charge exorbitant rents, which, in fact, are quite often subsidised by taxpayers through housing benefit.
&gt; An additional effect of LVT, and if also there had been credit controls, is that this would not only have more or less eliminated house price inflation, but also would have allowed the Bank of England to lower interest rates with less risk of inflation. This would have made home loans more affordable (especially as house prices would also have been much lower), and it would have benefited business, and therefore the economy as a whole.
&gt; Moreover, LVT would have benefited the economy in other ways. In particular, it would have prevented the funnelling of money into property that creates no wealth, and have allowed more to go into savings for pensions and for genuine investment in new productive activities, upon which economic development depends, including expanding and improving the stock of housing.",4,AntiNeoLiberal,True,t3_2b87gx,0,cj35lls,0,1434816437,

Background:  I bought the game, was pretty neat, built some rockets, made better rockets, strapped more boosters onto the rockets, added more engines to the rockets... tried to attain orbit, added more engines... attained orbit!  Now, the Mun... more boosters...better staging...learning orbit trajectories, more boosters, more engines, more rockets on my rocket...etc...

Introduced my roommate, an aerospace engineer.  He started on the same path as me, but then - he stopped adding solid boosters and adding liquid fuel engines - he started going for efficiency.  

Now, my roommate has taken all of his yearly vacation and sick days, because he's just designing better and better space craft.  

&lt;skip ahead&gt; he's now negative time-off, he has to earn it back.  He has orbital refueling stations, he has science centers collecting data, he's landed and returned from most of the interesting planets nearby. 

My roommate is currently creating a colony on some Mars'ish planet, he's creating Space Planes - they fly through atmosphere, then they boost and hit orbit, then he docks with a refueling station and is sending them to another planet, where they will orbit, land, come back to deliver the science which will then dock with an interplanetary space ship that will refuel and head back to Kerbin to deliver the data. He has rovers, and hover-craft that can land vertically without a runway.  He has orbiting satellites, he's collected data from the Sun, he's performing orbital synchronization and playing with gravitational slingshots, he's...who knows what the heck he's doing - he has an Entire Space Program, and it all works together.

There's infinite potential in this game!  I'm so glad I introduced him to it, because I would have never had the patience for it.  He's over 600 hours in, and he's still going.

Other friend i introduced - still playing 3 months later, and he's still strapping more boosters and liquid fuel engines, just half-hazard, and he's still playing, too!

Any play style you can think of, this game seems to have it.  Hope this helps.",12,reddit_in_peace,True,t3_2b91id,0,cj306rb,0,1434813780,

Sorry for the condiluted post, essentially, a lot of the new units could be said to be ""the best units in the game"" as a collective batch but I don't believe there's any one unit that is shockingly better than the others in these power creep batches. With the right teams they can all be OP :)",2,Trollamon,True,t3_2b81h9,0,cj2tyvz,0,1434810694,

Soldier - The Old Glory, an American flag on a pole and stand. Which way the flag is blowing (towards RED or BLU spawn) indicates which mode it is operating in; the indicated team gets a local protection bonus and the other team a local damage malus, depending on the strength of the wind (three levels, 'off', lvl1, lvl2). Which way it is blowing, and how strongly, is based on the collective performance (k:d and p:d, dominations of:by) of all Soldiers on either team.

Pyro - Campfire. Lights enemies on fire, provides a constant source of flame for snipers to light huntsman off of. Pyro can feed it by airblasting into it, after ~20 airblasts it grows into - Bonfire. Same as before but much larger and reveals cloaked spies with the thick smoke it gives off, has more health. After an additional ~20 airblasts it fully forms into - FIRE! This just immediately ignites any enemies in the area, in addition to all of the above (and gets larger, more health). All forms constantly slowly lose their health, which airblasting also restores, turning back into smaller forms as they cross that threshold. The rate of innate health loss increases with upgrades.

Demo - Large Highland Super-Slosher. A large, complex-looking still which slowly ferments a new batch of brew over time, plus constant very minor local heal effect for teammates (less than LVL1 dispenser). Once a batch is available any team member may activate it to gain 'drunk' status bonus and malus (visual disruption, reduced turning ability, but huge damage resistance and all melee minicrits as default). Demos with bottles, Snipers with jarate, or Scouts with Mad-milk may store the effect for later activation by taunting with that weapon.

Heavy - The Forbidden Fridge, a full-size refrigerator covered in chains, which rattles and shakes as if something trapped inside is desperately trying to break free (it becomes more agitated when damaged). Starts with very high initial health, and as it becomes more and more damaged it opens slightly, revealing glimpses of the giant siberian grizzly trapped inside. Above 50% health it gives a decent healing effect to teammates. Below 50% health the bear will attempt to attack anyone in range, inflicting a regular melee hit and bleed damage, once every few seconds (one total hit every few seconds, not per each player in range). Once destroyed the bear breaks free and relentlessly pursues the person responsible for the buildings destruction, until it kills its quarry or is destroyed itself.

Engineer - The Rancho Relaxo MKII. An actual constructable version of the taunt chair, to be used by any other teammate (or disguised spy). Has no other effect.

Medic - ????? can't think of anything. any kind of healing effect would be pointless next to medigun, and a good offensive/defensive effect or ability seems inappropriate for Medic to have.

Sniper - The Bastardly Blind, a loose cover of planks and dirt, which any teammate (or disguised enemy spy) may crouch in to become invisible (has no collision box). Moving in it while crouched makes you merely translucent, moving or standing uncrouched has no effect. Slowly drains health from those using it.

Spy - The Finer Thing, a very well-made leather chair, perfect for relaxing in by a fire, while sipping fine bourbon and cleaning your vast knife collection. Has no team affiliation once built - any player may sit in it to regain health and ammo, and any Spy can hide in it (one at a time, please, gentlemen), and easily backstab any player sitting in it (invulnerable as long as the building persists).",6,eugd,True,t3_2b7v3m,0,cj2town,0,1434810659,

I hit Christmas ASAP because the reindeer are really helpful to boost the initial buildup and I try not to buy any more than I need to until after I get Final Claus/Santa's Dominion.  It's only a small decrease in cost on buildings and upgrades but every little bit helps.
After Santa's Dominion I bump up the the first 100 on all buildings, and go up to about 130 prisms, then wait for grandmapocalypse research to complete and start saving for Kitten Managers.  When the research has completed and I have wrinklers full enough to buy KM's when popped I cycle thru Valentines really quickly for the 6 heart cookies and then switch to Halloween to collect those cookies as I start popping the wrinklers (I don't worry about whether I've collected all the Christmas cookies yet because I'm going to hang out in Christmas long-term after I've collected everything from the other seasons.)  There was a strategy posted a while ago that you save before you pop the wrinklers and if you don't get the random drops you need from popping them **refresh** and re-pop until you get what you need.  I use this to finish Halloween within about three rounds of wrinklers (could probably do it in only one round if I was really persistent about it) and then switch to Easter and use the same trick with wrinklers to collect all the eggs within a couple hours.  Then back to Christmas and reindeer for the long haul.

I've played other RTS games but the only CnC games I've played are one I can't remember, before my mum saw how realistic and violent it was and stopped me from playing it, and a one-level demo of Tiberium Wars... so, not much knowledge! 

Does it have a similar thing? I thought in most RTS games once you'd mined resources, they were available globally... That's how it works in AoM anyway.

&gt; And yes, the downside is meant to hamper the upside.

I dunno... obviously the weapons are sidegrades in TF2 so for each upside there has to be a downside, but usually the upside means that one strategy works even better than usual whereas the downside means that *a different* strategy doesn't work so well. 

- e.g. The Direct Hit rocket launcher is great if you can hit enemies directly, and good for taking out buildings, but has almost no splash radius so the strategy of aiming for an enemy's feet is severely nerfed.

  Backburner crits from behind, but uses far more ammo to airblast - but if you're approaching enemies from behind, you're nowhere near flaming teammates and the enemy shouldn't be shooting projectiles at you so you won't need the airblast so much.

  The Gunslinger is great for dealing small amounts of damage whilst being mobile, but almost useless for static nests with lower health and damage output compared with the normal sentry. (Although I still sometimes use a static one to guard aggressive teleporter placements just because I hate having a level 3 destroyed before it gets any kills).

Off the top of my head at least, I can't think of any weapons where the nerf directly debuffs the same tactic that the boost encourages - but with this dispenser, the leveling down nerf *would* directly discourage you from roaming, which is what the boost seems to intend to encourage.

&gt; Although I wouldn't call this griefing - griefing is when you hurt your team.

Maybe not griefing, then. But I definitely feel like a bit of a troll when I realize the top player on the enemy team is a Scout, and I switch to Gunslinger - I did this the other day to a Scout who had several dominations using the BFB - within minutes I was dominating him, and he got pretty pissy at me. And, there's a recent video by Star_ where he and (Boo?) both play Ambassador Spypers to deliberately troll the other team. In fact, spawncamping in general is heavily looked down upon, even though it's a valid tactic.

But yeah, if you could manage to keep the dispenser alive and deny the other team their metal, it'd be pretty cool. Just so long as it's fairly easy for a team that is competent at pushing out to overcome the tactic, else obviously RED would win every map...

&gt;If you have Rescue Ranger equipped with this, and manage to teleport your level 3 dispenser way behind the enemy lines, you can set up that level 3 sentry + teleporter very easily, while still being able to scout around and dish out damage with your shotgun.

This bit sounds good, although it seems to be basically the same tactics as using the EE wrench and teleporting your stuff to a an aggressively placed exit, but without the stupidly slow upgrade times so long as you place the dispenser on an ammo pack...

And, I still wouldn't want to venture away from the nest in this situation - I think I see what you're saying about selling the sentries - if they're attacked you can quickly set up somewhere else, but if they come after *you* then there's not much you can do about it still. If a competent player notices you using this dispenser, then the obvious tactic is to pick you off first, and then look for the (maximum level 1) sentry/dispenser/teleporter. So unless the other team are incompetent, the best thing to do still is just hide behind the Sentry.

I dunno. I keep losing my train of thought... I guess I'm getting hungry or something. It seems like an alright idea, but for completely the opposite strategy. It's almost OP for setting up nests - being able to upgrade your teleporter and sentry simultaneously so long as you have enough metal, and being able to double the amount of metal your team collectively gets from crates. And you can run around behind your own lines to pick up ammo to build your nest near-instantly.

But, it still seems like suicide to me to move away from your sentry. Maybe you can take a few risks if your stuff isn't built yet anyway, and I guess you can wander around within your sentry's protection a bit more... but yeah, I'd still never want to risk leaving my sentry's protection, which defeats the purpose of the item anyway.

Also... I might've skipped over/forgotten if you mentioned this, but, if a Spy saps your stuff, you can't demolish it until you've removed the sapper, even with a normal dispenser. So I assume that's the same here? If your buildings are being sapped, you can't sell them/move them until you've knocked the sapper off?

If that is the case, then not only are *you* vulnerable to being picked and losing 2 levels on your buildings, but if you leave your nest unguarded then a Spy can just walk right in there and sap all your stuff, knowing that you won't get back there in time to save it... (And, if it's not the case and you can still demolish the buildings, then that's a **massive** buff - not just because you can reclaim the metal, but the same as with using the normal dispenser, you can rebuild your stuff the moment it gets sapped instead of having to wait until the sapper destroys it before you can build again)...",1,Patrik333,True,t3_2b7do1,0,cj2lqof,0,1434806750,

My current events feedback:

*Type of events - Event models where you can just play the game in any location, doing what you want without feeling 'punished' for not grinding a certain mode your whole playtime are definitely the best. The recent 250% experience boost was amazing, also.

*Craftable items - Having different bits is fine for long term things like Sentinel parts, but please consider the Pot of Gold model of just one bit to collect for these short duration events. It took me hours to get **four** Relishes last time the hot dog event was live, and in that time span I got nearly 20 of all the other parts.

*'Reaper' wandering loot buffs - These are nice, but I do wish there was a grace period of a few minutes in between transitions (if there isn't already), especially for X-Defense where you can't really control when you fail if you're with randoms. 

*Log-in Loot Explosions - I really like these and hope more events can have them, but at least made so you get 1 for logging in any time during the event and not just Saturday. I know during the Easter and Bounty Hunter event I didn't have too much time to play so I couldn't get enough of the currencies for the uniques, but I did at least feel like I got something awesome with those loot explosion items. (A boss drop box with account bound artifacts would have been *amazing* by the way, since there's a snowball's chance in hell most of us will get any of those to drop. I have yet to even see one of those Gorilla necklaces or ESP boxes linked in game.)

*The Loot - So far, so good. Donation/vendor item drops, special uniques, RNG boxes, legendaries, and loot explosions.

Some recommendations include:

* Traditional 401K (max out)
* HSA (max out) / FSA (at least $500).  HSA is ""best"" as the balance can grow long-term, but it's good if you don't have any real medical issues.  FSA is still not bad if you do have medical issues as you can at least budget it all pre-tax.  (Deduction on Schedule A is going to have to exceed 10% of your AGI, so a minimum of $10K.)
* Get married (if your spouse doesn't have a high income, this will reduce your taxes significantly.)
* Have kids (more ""dependents"" the better, at least it'll boost your exemptions.  However, you won't be eligible for the child tax credit.)
* With kids, contribute to the dependent care FSA for childcare services and max it out.  You'll probably want to stop at 2 kids, seeing as benefits don't grow exponentially here.
* Consider contributing to a 529 plan for the kids.  No immediate federal tax benefits (later when withdrawn), but some states offer tax credits (dollar for dollar tax savings) or a tax deduction.
* Buy a home (lose the ability to be mobile and move early on, but deduction of property tax and mortgage interest is good for tax savings).
* Be charitable and get receipts!
* Part of above, volunteer for qualified 501c3 organizations and consider serving on their board if you have a skill you can use.  While your time cannot be considered a charitable expense, mileage to/from meetings and any travel (airfare) for the organization that is paid out of pocket and not reimbursed can be considered a charitable contribution with the right documentation.
* Buy a second home as a rental property, or perhaps make your primary home a duplex/townhouse.  Your rent collected becomes income, but it should pay for all of the ordinary expenses you're incurring (taxes, mortgage interest, etc.) -- but you get to take a deduction for depreciation, which usually means a loss.  Losses will be limited and provide some limited benefit BUT will help in the year of the sale.

Some other general tidbits, lower on the list in terms of what to do with extra cash.

* Max out a Traditional IRA and then do a backdoor Roth IRA.  You're AGI is too high to have a deductible traditional IRA or to contribute directly to a Roth.  But if given the chance to have a taxable account or a Roth IRA, the Roth will be better as it all will grow tax-free when in retirement.

**SO LET ME TELL YOU SUPPORTS HOW TO CARRY**

* PICK GOOD CHAMPS

Aphromoo's suport teir list: braum, thresh, nami, afk, feed. Personal note: morg is fuckin op. pick those champs. (would not recommend picking afk or feed. pretty underpowered this patch. still better than janna, though.)

* **PRACTICE**

be dedicated to your art. support is a unique playstyle. if mastered, you too can carry games vicariously through you allies. they are your weapons. pick from the list of good champs and spam the living shit out of them. 

learn basic math. know your build route, how much it will cost, how many consumable you will need, dont rush sightstone like a mad man thinking the gold efficiency will win you the game, count your tank waves. 

**Learn the ward game.** Learn how long your wards last, know not only how many wards you have, but how many they have. learn where they ward. Keep track of their ward count everytime they go into fog of war. They went river for a sec? did their ward count go down by one? then theres a ward in river. you dont pay attention to the creep wave like a carry does. 

practice your **mechanics,** practice ward tricks (if you know they have a sweep available, throw trinket ward, THEN longer duration ward, use their greed to their disadvantage: place a pink to let them kill it, use it to set up a snare or hook as they sit and kill it 300g&gt;100g), practice warding the tri brush over drag pit (its hard), practice your harass, give presence in lane. dont neglect your farm or gold generation, learn auto attack distances of your enemy. 

* **MINDSET**

As a support, **YOU ARE THE GAME MASTER.** You are the gamemaster, and the rest of your teammates are the players in your game. *You control the game's difficulty for the rest of them.* You play well: that means the rest of your team is playing league on easy. Nice. You play your heart out and set up kills fucking everywhere, you light that fucking map UP. You call the shots, you watch out for the bloodthirsty soldiers. YOU CONTROL THE FIGHTS. If a fight goes wrong, that is because you let it go wrong. Make the enemy suffer, and watch your team rake them in. You will go unnoticed and unpraised, for 90% of the shit you do. 

**STATS and ITEMS**

as a support: CDR and MOVESPEED. You are utility, so you need to be casting spells all the time, everywhere. HP is decent for taking a licking and staying in the fray casting yo shit. 

* **Morgana.**

pick this champ. Aphro's list is good, sure. But he is LCS. You are not. Morg can carry games. her utility, catch, black shield, and even her kill potential are some of the best all round for a support. I frequently end games as 2nd highest damage. AS SUPPORT MORG. Next highest is whoever I CHOOSE IT TO BE. If my adc sucks, roam mid when you can, get mid fed, get drag control, light the map up, do not engage when black shield is down, be smart. 

*Black shield* - cait traps, jinx snares, zyra snares, alistar stuns, trist bleeds, thresh everything, nami everything, cait-ashe-jinx slows (even though its phys dmg you can negate the slow and gtfo), ashe ult, ETC. AND THATS JUST IN LANE. **Black shield is OP.** USE IT. 

Your snare is godly. Get good at landing it by learning how to read your enemy. Dont watch your cs, watch THEIRS. something low? they will go in and auto the cs, you will auto THEM, they are on the fringe? SNARE. lane a snare? W for harass. 

*POOL OF MONEY* - Use this to generate decent money in lane. It's an instant, so its easy money. Usually procs all 3 frostfang charges in one W. dont put this in the middle of cs if you can avoid it, let your adc control the wave best as possible. dont spam this. you will oom much faster. 

*Ult* - use for burst dmg for kills in lane, easy to proc the stun if they are already snared. if they are engaging hard, use. if they are fleeing, use to slow and land a snare easier. low cd, easy to use, good results.

out of lane phase, **WARD YO SHIT.** This goes for any support, but double for champs with such good catch. get a sweep, throw sand in their eyes. 

**ROAM** like mad. I have movespeed quints cause Q is a kill on a 10 second cooldown. 

Build order is important. Armguard is good for lane, zhonya's is essential for teamfights, Liandry's is core for me. obviously sightstone and frostfang. 6th item depends, what i like to get in order of pref: deathcap, rylais, abyssal, or twin shadows. DC for all around kit boosting. Rylais for hp and synergy with liandry's, also better slows on ult and W is a slowing field now. Abyssal for niche games, and twin shadows if your catch is bad or vision game is lacking. Never do voidstaff on support morg. Locket is decent, but i dont get it for morgana. 

*SKILLS:* Morg is easy to skill. max Q first. Not only does it increase its damage, but also the snare duration. Very important. Max black shield second. More shield, more OP. Get one level in W at level 3 to start the gold generation. R when you can. 

*RUNES:* magicpen reds, armor yellows, magic resist per level blues (can use cdr if you want cdr early, and dont mind overcaping later), and movespeed quints. 

* **Thresh**

if you cant pick morg, pick thresh. Yes he may be hard, but you will learn.  his playmaking per game is a highlight reel waiting to happen. i get midair trist hooks and flays, I cancel jarvan combos, etc. 

*Hook* - His Q has a delay. Just takes practice to learn. Your first few games will be tough. Stick with it. Once you master it: lol gg to ez peace out twitch.tv/insertthreshplayerhere. I got people calling me god for snaring trist mid air. I DO THAT DAILY. Leona? LeNOna. Jarvan never looked more sad when i stepped on the rift. No slip and slide today J4. POOL'S CLOSED.

*Lantern* - lolnope.jpg in a spell. Take a bit of time to land, so predict when someone might need it, before they do. That sets up an instant lantern they can use. Use good lantern placement: try not to throw on 5 million cs and watch you ally try to cs instead of whoosh to safety. use to engage a jungler to a lane gank. Use for vision if checking brush or drag. Dont use to collect souls if there are enemy around. dont be over soul hungry. dont neglect them either, though. find a balance. 

*Flay* - lolnope2.jpg  GET BACK GET BACK I DONT KNOW YOU LIKE THAT. 

use for good peel. use backwards for engages. use in teamfights for control. typically, just use in the opposite direction they want to go. be wary, though, as if you are throwin peeps on yoself, get ready to take a lickin or two. you tough though. cause you know your items got your back. you aint a bitch. 

*BOX* - Fighting? RRRRRRRR

use in corridors, use on engages, retreats, objective control, just whenever really. 

You can throw the enemy into it too making them hit more than one part of the wall. 1:1 ratio on ap, and decent base damage. early and mid game, it can actually be use for decent burst on squishies in addition to the rest of your kit and 1st auto. nothing to boast about, but nothing to ignore. 

While learning Thresh, buy coin and stay on the fringe. Practice your Qs. coin gives a little mana regen and upgrades into movespeed activate that is decently useful. 

As you master the champ, start buying relic shield and targons. Now you have the job of learning how to last hit as thresh. Tough at first (broken record), but you will learn. Get 1st minion of 1st wave to have a charge back by tank minion wave. Prioritize: tanks&gt;melee&gt;range. However, dont sit around all day waiting to get the best creep, aka, never be at full charges, always have that ticker ticking. 

**ROAM BITCH** This is your playground. The others were not invited. Someone in *that* lane? THATS YO LANE NOW. 

*SKILLS:* get all spells by level 3. Max E while in lane for harass. AS SOON as you are out of lane, start maxing Q. I usually end up with 3-4 levels in flay by the time lane ends. Then midgame/teamfight/roaming begin, and my Q now gains priority for CDR. If their damage is considerable, put a couple points in W for that shield. Flay is for lane, Q for catch, W for defense. Obviously level R when available. 

*RUNES:* I run Attack damage reds, armor yellows, magic resist per level blues, 2 armor quints and one movespeed quint. ",2,Master__Roshi,True,t3_2b4pvk,0,cj1y43x,0,1434795359,

You are a government. People make goods and sell them to merchants. Merchants then take them somewhere else and sell them. You can tax goods both steps: when your people sell goods to merchants and when merchants sell goods to people.

Trade value is the value of the goods produced (price * goods produced). You always turn this into production income (modified by production efficiency).

Trade income comes from taxing merchants. This is based on how much trade value merchants under your jurisdiction handle. The share of all trade that flows through your ports and on your merchant's ships is based on your trade power. You can't directly control where merchants do business. However, building markets, controlling rivers, and patrolling sea lanes all encourage traders to go through your ports. Whomever has the most trade power in a node influences where the merchants go and who ends up taxing them. Gameplay wise, this means sending as much trade value to where you are collecting. If you try to collect at somewhere other than your trade capital it's hard to enforce your fees and tariffs, and you lose money.

Longer routes boost trade income because exotic goods are rarer and in more demand at home.

Trade flows one way because it's a simplification and during the period Europeans ended up dominating the long range sea routes.",1,LordBufo,True,t3_2b49tn,0,cj1xhqm,0,1434795068,

If its as hard as say the epic level mount was in vanilla WoW, then its irresponsible on their part to have a paid version on their store.  Some would argue that since a black market for in game currency is unavoidable, it helps curb that sort of thing and gives players a safe place to spend their money.  But that's just a bullshit justification for it.

That still doesn't give Blizzard a pass in my opinion.  Collecting things like mounts, gear, pets, rep is what has always kept WoW somewhat relevant.  It gives people something to do in the downtime, while they wait for new content.  Or it just gives them a break from their current grind.  For others, it is the game.  Some people like the social aspect of the game and enjoy the easter egg hunt for these things.  

In the end, putting the store there with vanity items will eventually lead to p2w features.  They've already introduced the level 90 boost.  They've already talked about wanting to add experience boost items to the store, and adding lesser charms of good fortune.

They'll introduce it in Asia first, because the market will be more accepting. Then they'll push it to EU and NA saying that there is ""demand"" for it, and there are always people willing to pay for things that make leveling faster.",1,haahaahaa,True,t3_2b0qcl,0,cj1ti5y,0,1434792841,

It is located in the lunar complex in the first room you encounter the Hive during the storyline. If you head up the double stairs past the door your ghost unlocks and opens. Youll come into the room with the blue pillars with the number 2 on them. This is also when you are ambushed by the hive. Standing in the initial entryway you stick to the right wall and head into the far back corner. This corner should also be just to the right of the exit. There is a box mainframe in the corner and if you jump on top it is laying there. As far as I can tell there isnt any indication it is there from the ground. I have photos if you need them let me know.

EDIT Located another one. As you exit the tunnel from the starting spawn location (Outside the wall). Just past the fan tunnel, youll exit out into the cosmodrome's first area. Youll see the shuttles on the left and 3 old tank wrecks sitting in an open field. Just on the other side you see 2 greenish buildings with a white and orange striped billboard looking piece arching across a passageway. Just behind that white board is the ghost. He is on the top part of the scaffolding. You can continue forward and hop on top of the buildings back tracking to the top of it.

EDIT 2 This needs to be reconfirmed due to the fact I collected it before I stumbled across this reddit. But in the divide not too far away from the last one I described is a train car with a section of rocket main booster tube. (Not sure as to the technical term) It is right after heading past the green buildings I described earlier heading to the rocketyard. You can clearly see it past the highway pillars.

It's super boring and tedious if you only start digging it up when you need it. Being stranded on a planet = no fun.

You also need it to craft steel (I think?), Durasteel, and some other bars in the future so it's nice to collect it early on as well.

Make weapons at your anvil as soon as you possibly can. From what I've found, they're stronger than most weapons that you can find. Don't bother using your bow too often, it's super weak and slows you down too much to use it for actual fighting. Replace it with a gun whenever you find one.

As for food, I farm mostly wheat. 2 wheat = bread which fills up 6 bars rather than Cooked Alien Meat which fills up 4.5. Also, if you have a cooking table and combine bread with carrot, it makes Carrot Bread (fancy, huh?) which, in addition to filling your health, gives you a regeneration status and gives you a nice little speed+jump boost. Then again, that's an Avian only recipe, so uh, good luck finding blueprints for it haha!

Also, when exploring a new cave or planet, make little marks in the ground (place odd colored bricks, etc.) as a ""bookmark"" in case you go back there later on. I *especially* recommend that on new planets, you mark where your spawn point is, when you first beam down. I didn't one time, and I nearly circled the planet twice because I ran right past it haha. I use cobblestone bricks for everything, it stands out (to me) and it's super cheap.

Bridge officers are high-ranking personnel that act as battle companions in ground combat and they also provide various skills and boost your ship capabilities during space combat. Duty officers are lower ranked crews that have similar appearance to card collecting games. They also provide bonus if assigned in your ship but their main purpose is to be sent away on duty missions.

Posted 25 June 2014 - 11:26 AM
Fellow Survivors,
 
Over the last few months we've been teasing a new free game experience that we are working on which will be available to all I:SS players. The wait is over and we are ready to share more details!
 
We are happy to announce that we've started development of a new spin-off game called Infestation: New Beginnings that will be available for FREE to all I:SS players this Fall. The new game will coexist alongside I:SS and will provide a different type of survival experience for our players. More information about the schedule of Alpha and Beta sessions is included at the end of this post.
 
We started thinking about this game back in November 2013, about the same time that OP Productions, LLC decided to shift away from Hammerpoint Interactive. We assembled a new in-house development team and joined forces with another development team to continue work on the Infestation brand. While some members of the Hammerpoint development team have joined us, most of the team is new and eager to address many of the unrealized opportunities present in the original Infestation: Survivor Stories. It became very clear that most of the changes the team wants to make are impossible without a game-wide wipe and reset. This is something that OP Productions hasn't been ready to do – after all, many loyal, active players are still enjoying the game.
 
Infestation: New Beginnings was born with a very clear goal: to create a truly free gaming experience for our players that will not require them to spend money in any way to advance or stay competitive and dominate! It must offer a fun, user-friendly experience for both new players and seasoned fans of the brand. Though this is no small task for an independent development team of our size to achieve, we owe it to our players to take on this challenge and we hope you will support us in this journey.
 
The team has been laser-focused on rebuilding the world of Infestation to create a product that revolves around the game world by providing tools and systems to players that actually change the world and make it more suitable for players to live in.
 
Here’s a look at some of the changes and additions we’ve been exploring for Infestation: New Beginnings:
 
New “Wild West” Themed Map
We’re introducing a completely new environment. We thought that it’d be cool to create a game with a Wild West vibe, so we designed the map to resemble the Southwestern US. Its initial size is 64 sq. km (square 8x8 km), comparable in size to the original Colorado map back in the I:SS Alpha. It has more open landscape for players to discover, and the area of the map that can be explored will be even bigger than the original Colorado map.
 
New Character Creation and Customization
All players will be able to create one customizable male or female character for free. There will be a variety of customization options for the face, clothing, hair style and color that can be unlocked by players. We will also be making unique, non-degrading cosmetic items available to allow for more customization. All character customizations will be permanent and will not disappear when your character will die.
 
Instant Revive
In New Beginnings, as soon as you die, you’ll be able to instantly jump back into the game. We wanted to remove the “instant-revive-for-GC” option that was present in Infestation: Survivor Stories as we felt it wasn’t fair to all players.
 
Global Inventory Changes
The only in-game locations where players can access their Global Inventory are VAULT buildings in safe zones. The size of the global inventory will be restricted. It’ll be big enough to satisfy heavy collecting habits for many players and there’ll also be a limited way to buy more GI slots for extreme collectors. Even so, it will still be limited in comparison to I:SS.
 
No Marketplace
The Marketplace of I:SS will be replaced with two new systems:
Package store: The package store will be accessible from the main menu and will function like a DLC shop, where players can purchase packs of discounted items. However, the number of packs available for you to buy will be time-limited to ensure that pay-to-win play is not possible. Packs will include sets of cosmetic items, skins for guns, and a cool new concept item called a “Gift Bomb.” Using this item triggers an explosion that rewards everyone in the immediate area EXCEPT the triggerman with some cool items. This is like going to a bar and saying, “next round is on me, everyone!”
Players Exchange: This system aims to feel like a stock exchange that allows players to buy and sell any item for GD only. The availability of items and their prices will be affected by what the players buy and sell, and will be balanced by the dev team to keep the I:NB economy in check. We will monitor the exchange to avoid clear speculations and black market situations, as well as controlling attempts at dupes and exploits. Players exchange will only be accessible from inside safe zones. This new method comes directly from some of the lessons we learned about managing the economy in I:SS.
Goodbye Premium Accounts
Premium accounts will be retired and replaced with purchasable “Boosts” of varying durations.
 
Server Channels
These will be streamlined and will also include “novice” channels to make it easier for new players to learn the game.
 
Stronghold Servers
Stronghold servers are not planned for this game.
 
Private Server Rentals
We are still debating about how this should be done, but one thing is clear: server owners will have way more options to control their servers. However, for the Alpha and Closed Beta periods we’ll only be allowing players to set their rentals to be publicly available. This will be changed in the Open Beta, but we’ll first want to test game mechanics and server infrastructure as much as possible. At the end of the Alpha and Closed Beta, accounts that rented servers will be reimbursed their rental costs.
 
New Loot and Crafting Systems
I:NB takes place around 10 years after the zombie outbreak, so as a result there won’t be many of the original I:SS items left in the world such as food, meds, guns or ammo. For New Beginnings, we’ve emphasized finding “materials” and “components” and crafting usable items from them. For example, very rarely will players find factory-made bandages but players will find components that can be used to craft bandages. Rare “original” items will have better overall properties compared to crafted ones, but will be harder to acquire and thus may have a higher resale value on the Players Exchange.
 
Availability of Projectile Weapons
Factory-made guns will now be extremely rare. Most of the time you’ll have rely on melee weapons or home-brew guns that you craft from the loot found in the environment.
 
Melee Weapons
Our ultimate goal is to have variations of cool, craftable, and crazy melee weapons available, similar to what one might see in a series like Dead Rising. We will most likely have a limited supply available for the Alpha, but we will add more as we go.
 
Ammo, Magazines Changes
We have redesigned how you load ammo in the game. Magazines are separate items and by attaching a magazine to the gun, players define how many bullets the gun can hold. Players will have to find or craft ammo and load it into the gun, and will also be able to unload bullets from guns and stack them in your backpack.
 
Skills
We’re exploring a new way of allowing players to gain “survival” skills rather than “hardened” skills. This system will be community-driven so at launch it will not be implemented. We will be soliciting ideas and feedback from our players.
 
Repairs
Repairs using GD are gone. Instead you’ll need to find Parts and Tools to repair broken guns, cars, armor, etc.
 
Building in the game
We are adding the ability to build your own base on the main map. This is the biggest new feature we’re adding to the game. You’ll be able to build private bases on a claimed land lot and we are also working on communal building systems for land lots as well. This will not be part of our initial launch since the building system is still in an active development phase. We’ve started with our Barricades system and our intention is to expand it into a full-featured building UI experience.
 
We have a large number of other changes to the game mechanics, and covered lots of them here http://forums.infestationmmo.com/index.php?/topic/148552-infestation-new-beginning-what-do-we-know-so-far/, and we will be continuing to provide you  with updates and developments as we work.
 
So the big question then is: when will you have access to this game? 
Infestation: New Beginnings will launch in several phases: the Alpha sneak peak, Alpha access, Closed Beta access, and the Open Beta.
 
The Alpha sneak peek will be available to the following categories of players:
Legendary and Pioneer accounts
Anyone who spent at least $10 USD (or equivalent) on GC since March 31, 2014
Anyone who has played at least 200 hours since March 31, 2014
The goal of this phase is to challenge the game’s overall stability, servers, and systems. We believe players trying the game at this phase have been the most invested players in I:SS and can therefore provide the most valuable feedback that will affect development going forward.
Alpha access will be available to ALL I:SS players who have played more than 40 hours. This will be the first massive test of the game.
Closed Beta will be available to all players who have an active I:SS account.
Open Beta will be available for anyone to play.
We’re really excited about sharing all of this new stuff with you and we’ll do our best to support both I:SS players and new players who try out I:NB.

She’d been awake all night, eyes locked blankly on the darkened ceiling overhead, staring and waiting for the light of the sun to restore some sort of familiarity back to her senses. Yet as it rose, it brought with it no comfort, only walls she didn't recognize and a view that wasn't her own. She sighed heavily.

It’d been no more than 15 hours since they’d taken her, forced her into the van and driven her to the work camp. She protested, cried out and begged her mother to do something—to do anything—but she didn’t. She couldn’t. It wasn’t her choice. Sarah knew that. If anyone was to blame, it was her own damn fault. She’d been single for two years now, willingly declined any sort of romantic advances to instead focus on her knitting and cat collecting. She knew that was illegal, knew the consequences, knew that those over 16-years-old not in a relationship after 730 days were deemed wasted flesh and confined to a work camp. But she felt invincible, she felt above the law. She knew she was beautiful, that she could get anyone she chose – why would they lock her away for opting to make the boys wait? They needed more women, especially pretty ones. They only ever locked up the single boys; they would never take her, even if she stayed alone for five years. 

“M’lady,” said a voice from outside the cabin window, the abruptness of it causing her to jump. “M’lady, please open the door.”

They had been standing outside her cabin all night, moaning and wheezing amongst themselves like a pack of asthmatic zombies. The van driver told her to that word of her arrival had spread throughout the camp like free pot at a Phish concert—that fedoras and tuxedos were ordered in bulk from all of the finest department stores nearby; the commissary had completely sold out of heart-shaped chocolate boxes. When the other prisoners learned that a female would be locked up, all sense of order dissipated, and the forced work stopped entirely.

“I bought you some chocolates,” said a voice from the window slightly above Sarah’s head. She exhaled heavily and rolled over onto her side.

The van driver mournfully explained that this particular camp hadn’t seen a female prisoner in decades—it usually only accepted the worst of the worst, never anyone quite like Sarah. ""Neckbeards,"" he called them. The last woman to arrive was significantly overweight and suffered from a terrible skin condition in which her face looked exactly like a shaved Chihuahua’s. Regardless, not a single Yu-Gi-Oh card, nor Nintendo DS, nor World of Warcraft account was touched the morning of her arrival. By the end of the day, she was engaged to be wed and immediately released from the program, having entered into a relationship. Sarah wanted none of that; none of the romance, none of the pageantry, none of the intimacy. She just wanted to continue her knitting, to continue raising as many cats as possible, to be allowed to live her life by her own choosing.

“M’lady,” interrupted a voice again, this time squeaking in from the far end of the cabin, “I found the key to the door. I am going to come in and save you.”

Sarah quickly pushed herself up off the bed and onto her feet. “I don’t need saving, thank you,” she stammered.

“M’lady, please. I can be the hero you need,” said the voice. The doorknob jiggled slightly as the single stream of light pouring through keyhole vanished.

“Please leave me alone,” Sarah said, taking a step toward the wall furthest from the door.

“Are you in trouble?” said a voice behind her. She turned and glanced up at its source. The pale, overweight face of a man stared back at her through the window, his pumpkin-colored hair pulled tight in a ponytail, thick framed glasses resting just above his nose. He brought his hand to his mouth and pushed down on an inhaler, then wheezed loudly.

“No, I'm fine. I just want to be left alone,” Sarah said. She glanced above the window in search of blinds, yet a thin line of dust seemed to signal that they had recently been removed. The doorknob behind her resumed jingling.

Sarah turned back around and stared at the door, watching as the golden knob slowly turned left. The stream of light pierced back through the keyhole, then silently crawled across the wood floor like a searchlight as the door slowly opened. She took another step back, so that she was flush against the far wall of the cabin. She just wanted to be home, to be locked in her room with just her desk lamp on, staring down at her lap while working on her knitting.

“M’lady, I want to introduce myself to you,” said a man’s voice from behind the door, his hand now creeping into the room. It was a plump hand, the fingers like little sausages attached to a balloon with a self-diagnosed thyroid condition that somewhat resembled a palm.

“Please, just leave me alone. Please, please,” Sarah pleaded. Just a few hours ago, less than even a day, she had been relaxing comfortably in her room, petting one of her fourteen cats and perfecting the stitching on her latest sweater.

“Do not be afraid of me,” said the man, “I am going to show you some nice internet memes. Do you like doge? I also brought some of my favorite manga.” The hand gave birth to the rest of an arm, followed by a shoulder, torso, neck, and legs. He was round, like a beach ball that got fed up with not having arms and legs, yet seemed to have no grasp on human proportions. His legs were short and stumpy, folds of fat cascading past his knees. His arms pointed outwards like car doors that were rusted open, his hands poking out from the sleeves of his black trench coat. Sarah was sure that if he fell over on a hill, he’d simply cartwheel uncontrollably toward the bottom. A black, pinstriped fedora sat upon his head, clearly too small for his disturbingly overweight frame. A thick, unkempt beard began at his chin and extended down over his neck. Sarah placed her palms against the wood of the wall, as if trying to phase through it to escape.

“Stop, please go away. Please,” she said. Another hand slowly slid into view from behind the door, this one boney and malnourished. A stick-like body followed, a similarly disproportionate fedora placed haphazardly upon his head. If it weren’t for the fact that they were already in a work camp, Sarah would’ve immediately figured this boy to be a holocaust survivor. A large symbol Sarah recognized as something from Star Wars—or perhaps Star Trek—was printed on the front of his shirt.

“Hello, m’lady,” said the skeleton figure. “I wanted to personally welcome you to our free-thought zone. Your graceful beauty is most welcome amongst us sirs. I see you have a cross on your necklace, I just wanted to let you know that I’d be happy to explain science to you. Then we can get rid of that silly thing.”

“Please,” Sarah muttered.

Another hand appeared behind the door, followed by several more. Men of two sizes—either impossibly emaciated or disturbingly obese—slowly slid into the room, waddling toward her like a horde of freshly reanimated corpses. They wheezed in anticipation, their hands outstretched with gifts of roses, chocolates, pictures of Neil DeGrasse Tyson, and Magic the Gathering booster packs.

Sarah fell to the floor, her hands wrapped her arms around her knees, as stared up as their shadows slowly blocked out the sun from behind the door. She closed her eyes and screamed, just as the perfectly round man knelt down in front of her and began reading aloud from Richard Dawkin's *The God Delusion.*",56,ChokingVictim,True,t3_2b24pe,0,cj13x59,0,1434780523,

Shortly after collecting, and after all of my b day money spent, I had amassed a large collection of cards. The next weekend I went to a flee market to trade and walla, completed the base set. I was proud of my collection. And proud of myself and luck. I then made the mistake of taking them to school. I was in the 5th grade at the time. During gym class someone had learned I had a charizard card and decided to break into my locker and steal all of them. I was broken hearted. My brother, whom I am close to, decided to help me recollect and a few years later we had every card in existence (minus the uber rare top 10). Well I outgrew pokemon and went on with my life, eventually joining the military and shipping off over - seas. Me and my brother kinda grew apart, but after 7 years of not really talking, he come out across the country to visit. He of course brings our most cherished childhood  memory, our cards. Now we are talking on the phone once a week continuing on with our collection. We have now completed up to the 7th set of cards and moving on. Pokemon has actually brought me and my brother closer even after years apart, and of course I feel like a kid again.

[GameJolt](http://goo.gl/z3qFPK) | [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/cfantarella)

&gt; Hi everyone!
&gt; I've recently [published a mini-game to GameJolt](http://goo.gl/z3qFPK) for the #IndieQuilt charity game jam, called Zymo.
&gt; It's based on a single level from another work-in-progress, called [Zygote](http://www.gamesofedan.com/zygote).
&gt; [Zymo is now available to play/test on GameJolt](http://goo.gl/z3qFPK).

**Feedback Requested**

* Performance: Does the game run well on your computer, in terms of performance &amp; load times?
* Balancing: Can you complete the challenge at different difficulty levels? I suspect that I may still need to work the bonus/enemy balancing at higher difficulties.
* Controls: Did your player character 'feel' right? Does the player accelerate/stop/strafe in a comfortable &amp; expected manner?
* Sound/Music: I'm looking to add some general background music. Do you feel that music could positively affect the experience?
* Instruction: Did you understand the objective and basic premise of the game easily? Or would you like to see more info/tutorial/help?

&gt; Thank you. Have a great weekend!
&gt; Carmine.

**OBJECTIVE**

Escape *Zymo* by reaching the exit before your timer expires and the K1A drones hunt you.

**MAIN CONTROLS**

*    [ WASD ] to move
*    [ Mouse ] to look
*    [ F of middle mouse button ] to interact (eg. pickup items, open doors)

**EXTRA CONTROLS** (Optional; not required to complete the game)

*    [ Left Shift ] to walk/rest
*    [ C ] to crouch/rest
*    [ Space ] to jump
*    [ P ] to pause game
*    [ ~ ] to change key bindings
*    [ F1 ] displays in-game menu
*    [ Tab ] selects targets in scanner
*    [ X ] to self-destruct
*    [ M ] to show/hide HUD messages
*    [ &gt; ? ] to zoom HUD scanner display
*    [ : "" ] to zoom HUD scanner icons
*    [ { } ] to change HUD scanner max range displayed
*    [ Escape ] to enter HUD mode (eg. to click on scanner targets)

**HEALTH**

Your health must be managed during the run, and deteriorates as your heart rate increases. You start the level in a heightened state of alert (ie. full of adrenalin and ready to run), so your heart rate is increasing and your overall health is degrading.

*    Rest by walking [ Left Shift ] or crouching [ C ] to regenerate your health and normalise your heart rate. You can also rest to quickly recover from damage.
*    Find Beta Blockers to receive an immediate health boost and normalise your heart rate, resulting in less resting being required.

**TIME**

After exiting the entry room your countdown timer will automatically begin. Reach the exit before your timer expires to successfully complete the challenge.

*    Find Time Bonuses to extend your countdown timer. Green bonuses will generally reward you with larger time extensions.

**KEYS &amp; GATES**

Occasionally you'll be presented with a locked gate.

*    Search and collect [ F to pick up ] the Orb Key from the nearby sector and return it to the Gate.
*    Unlock the Gate Lock [ F to interact ] and continue through the level.

**MENU OPTIONS**

Modify the game parameters using the main menu. Note that there is also an in-game menu for setting other options.

*    Change *Difficulty* to alter the frequency of bonuses and enemies scattered throughout the level.
*    Change *Path Length* to alter the approximate distance to the exit. The procedural generator uses this value as a hint when creating the level.
*    Toggle *Permadeath* to enable/disable dying. When disabled, you'll only suffer a brief black out, and regain consciousness quickly so you can continue your run.
*    Enter a custom *Seed Value* to initialise the level generator with a unique key. Reuse the same seed to replay a custom level.
*    Click the [ Indie Quilt Setup ] button to initialise the options for the Indie Quilt Game Jam. This just selects options to generate a short 30 second level with one sector and a appropriate starting time.

&gt;     1. How exactly does investing with your TFSA work? Do you simply put money into your TFSA (up to the maximum deposit per year) and then simply tell the bank what you want to invest it into? Also, the money in your TFSA is also subject to annual interest, correct? If you choose to invest your TFSA into a mutual fund or stock, are you still collecting interest on your initial balance, and is the income from investing subject to interest as well?

As I said Earlier. All money earned on the TFSA is never taxed. The strategy I described above is the low risk, low return route. Mutual Fund and Stocks will tend to get you a lot more return but also offer more risk. Also there can be fee's which is why I have stayed out of it. I don't feel I know enough, and I am not prepared to invest a signifigant portion of my TFSA's into them until I have more savings. 

Your TFSA goes where you want it to. 

* GIC's at fixed interest for a set term.
* Mutual Funds
* Stocks
* ETF's

Any amount you earn will not be taxed. including interest, dividends, etc. 

&gt;     2. If there a fee for withdrawing money from your TFSA?

Nope. It is just a Government approved savings account. That is all. The Banks just get to operate it. You are only subject to whatever banking fees your transactions might create. But I can't think of any that relate to the TFSA itself beyonds fines and penalties for over contributing.

&gt;     3. You mentioned storing TFSAs in a GIC, could you explain what a GIC is and elaborate a bit more on what it means to store a TFSA in one? Also, when trying to look at interest rate offers between banks, what should I look for, and how should I use that information to haggle with the bank?

I usually save my money in a power savings account with Scotia until I reach 5500. I schedule an appointment with a financial advisor at scotia bank to meet with them and discuss purchasing TFSA's. You can do this through emails, but you actually want a face to face interaction with them, it helps in many ways.

When I meet with them I tell them I would like to invest and I am interested in locking away the money with scotia for a certain period of time if I am guaranteed a certain interest return. We will discuss these as GIC's which basically in this case are just lables saying this portion of money is guaranteed to be given to you upon the completion of this aggreement.  I have locked my money away from 6 months- 3 years. Longer you lock it away, the more interest you can negotiate for.  

When I say negotiate, all I am really doing is just going to scotia, seeing what interest rates they currently offer as specials for all their promotions. Then I shop competitors and see what they offer. Then I just say outright, this bank is offering this much here. and you offered this here. Will you give me this rate? 

If yes, I will lock the money away for a longer period, if no and they offer me less, I will usually agree to a shorter period, so I can capitalize on newer interest rates.

The banks benefit is they can use that money for their general operation loaning proceadures within their banking industry regulation without concern that I will take money out. Plus they get to have a large leveraging amount when they pile my money with all their other investment portfolios. It gets complicated and I am not comfortable discussing all this with expertise so I will stop there. 

Take note banks don't tend to offer really great rates now, because market kind of sucks. So you can hope for 3% as an ideal right now if your lucky. In the past I got like 6% Pretty nice. 2% is pretty good but you just have to see what all the banks are offering and see what the highest rate is. This will usually end with the advisor saying they will need to get approval for the interest rate and they will email you back with confirmation.

&gt;     4. You also mentioned minimum balances. Does Scotiabank require minimum balances when setting up a TFSA?

Scotia, I don't think so. TFSA's as a rule have no minimum balance. You could deposit a nickle for shits and giggles if you wanted to. As long as you have an existing account you should be able to buy a TFSA.

I only mentioned Minimum balances to contrast sticking your money in a high interest savings account, which usually requires much more significant money amounts to qualify for the interest boost.

&gt;    5. In the event that you deposit the maximum amount allowed for the year, what would be your second choice for putting money away? Could you, and would you get another TFSA? Or would you put it into something like an RRSP or a regular savings account?

I try to max out mr RRSP and TFSA each year.

Thats basically 15000 savings each year for my income bracket.

For me, I like the short term gain of the Refund from a RRSP. It is usually a significant amount. The compounding on a RRSP is nice on the long-term as well and since your young, whatever you put in now will be compounded more heavily.
 
You can contribute up to 18% of your previous years income into RRSP. If your not sure, when you file your taxes you get a notice of assessment which tells you how much you can contribute. 

Thats why I preference that first, then I fill my RRSP.

If thats full, then I just like to save in a power savings account.  I used to say 6 months income was a good rainy day fund. Then I said a year, Now I am saying two years. 

I am basically just trying to have as much saved as possible to pay off my mortgage, and have money left over to get a second property for rental purposes. That could make some decent income, and I'm relatively good at finding good tenants.

I didn't realize TFSA was 19. I thought it was 17. Hmm thats okay then.

You don't have to collect orts, but it's recommended that you do as they unlock a week-long 3%/6% experience boost if you're on the same world as an avatar/ within interaction distance of an avatar respectively.

You can find the clan avatar in the clan citadel, which is located just south of Fallador, where the air altar used to be. It's a big floating blue sphere. Once inside the citadel, press the world map and find the ""Herblore Habitat"". It's all the way north.

Every clan can have up to three clan avatars, we have three.

No, you don't have to collect anything specific. However, you may be locked out of collecting certain resources at the start of the week temporarily while we're collecting upkeep. Upkeep is used to maintain the citadel from week to week.

Yes, we have maxed out all the important stuff in our citadel. (or do you mean to ask something else with this question?)

We don't have any specific goals. Feel free to do whatever you want! (as long as it's in line with our [clan rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditorsRS/wiki/clan-rules))

You get access to clan citadels which provides free weekly experience in some very costly skills: crafting and smithing. You also get access to a 3%/6% experience boost with Orts and clan avatars.

You'll also need Upgrades from MFR to adjust to the size of the area; the Harvester can harvest a 3x3 area  in front of the machine, extending out 1 block to each side and 1 block forward for every rank of the upgrade it contains. The Planter goes under the farm and can plant in a 3x3 area centered on the block above the Planter; each rank of Upgrade boosts that area by one block in all directions.

Connect power to the harvester and the planter. Place a chest behind the Harvester to collect output. Put a Servo itemduct on it whitelisted for saplings (preferably one type, generally oak) and connect that to the Planter.

Now you can collect your infinite wood from the chest, or route from it with another itemduct. You can dump wood from this into a furnace generator of some sort, or you can cook the logs into charcoal and dump those into a furnace. Either way works, and a large tree farm can supply many, many furnaces.

I'd recommend Furnace Generators or Steam Dynamos to actually produce the power, though if you find that you're getting WAY TOO MUCH in the way of saplings or wood and your system is getting jammed, routing the excess into a High-Temperature Furnace Generator will allow you to burn pretty much anything you have.",1,Nygmus,True,t3_2awy0u,0,cj012e1,0,1434761616,

I was introduced into magic a few years ago and I do not have any real close friends who play and have never played friday night magic or gone to any tournaments or anything of the sort. I spent a couple hundred dollars building up a small collection of cards and ended with maybe 2 or 3 decks that were actually fun to play with.

At the end of the day for me, duels is kind of perfect, 10 dollars to scratch my magic itch for another year.

Yes, the interface is a bit clunky and the transitions are pretty slow, and sure you are kind of locked into a deck from the start until you collect enough cards to build a better one (or pay to unlock the cards) and yes there are premium boosters that the only way to get those cards is to pay.

Its not perfect and some of the microtransactions are a bit... greedy, but none of them feel like they are necessary, and the developer said that to get all the premium cards there is a max of 14 boosters you buy, so an extra 28 dollars. So 38 dollars for a years worth a magic. Works for me.

I think a lot of the people who are disappointed with this game are the ones who are coming from playing paper magic and hoping to basically be able to recreate all of that in a digital space and do it all for only 10 dollars.",5,mashuto,True,t3_2ax9dy,0,cizx8bi,0,1434759682,

As for whether to boost a druid or DK, it's up to you. If you've played either, do you know yet which one you enjoy more? Which one you need more at max level? In the long run, either of those are more important than whether you get free profession skillups with the boost.

If you're interested in a druid anyway, I'd feel better about boosting it without professions. That's because gathering professions are unusually easy for druids, thanks to flight form. Fly to an herb (ore deposit, dead animal, whatever), pick it without leaving flight form even if nearby mobs are beating on you, fly away when you're done, collect your money and profession skill point.

I set my starting stats at 5, 6, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6 so I could get all the perks I wanted but I think you can get away with that 4 INT I mentioned

You can spend these souls at bonfires (checkpoints) to level up, or go back to a merchant or blacksmith to spend them on weapons/spells/upgrades. Dying only makes you drop unspent souls (the ones you're carrying on your person).

Say you're at a bonfire with zero souls, about to head forward into unknown territory. Say there are 10 enemies between here and the next bonfire (but you dont know that yet), and you move forward and kill 5 of them. Lets say you have 5000 souls now, and you see the 6th enemy from afar. He looks different, you don't know what his attacks are like. Do you risk going forward? Or should you head back to the bonfire and spend your 5000 souls, or maybe backtrack to a merchant? Its basically Risk vs Reward.

There's a secondary element at play here. Every time you rest at a bonfire, all non-boss enemies in the area respawn. So you cant simply kill two, return to the bonfire to use your souls, then move on to #3 and #4. You'd have to fight through the first two again. So, should you return and spend 5000 souls, then try fighting through all 10 enemies again, or cautiously move forward and dispatch the next 5 while shouldering the risk of losing those 5000 souls?

In gameplay, its an awesome mechanic. You're constantly weighing your options. You have a limited amount of healing potions, and these are replenished when you rest at a bonfire. Say you get through 9 enemies, are sitting on 15000 souls, have one potion left. Do you forge on, not knowing when the next bonfire will be? Suppose you do move ahead, killing the 10th enemy and hanging on to a sliver of life, then you turn a corner and see a bonfire tucked away in a corner. The relief you feel is *palpable*. There are so many instances where you'll find a new bonfire, rest at it and just put your controller down and close your eyes for a second. Its like you're Andy Dufresne, and every new bonfire you reach is an instance of you crawling out of that sewer into the rain. 

Suppose you fail on that 10th enemy. Now you've got 15000 souls waiting to be picked up, but your healing potions have been replenished, and you are steadily getting familiar with the first 9 enemies. You've seen them attack, you've seen the openings in their swings where you can counterattack. You **know** that it requires patience on your behalf. *As long as you keep your head*, this time you may get through the first 9 enemies a little quicker, with 4 potions to spare, 15000 souls accumulated plus the 15000 you retrieved from your bloodstain. Now its just enemy #10 left. You're smarter this time around, you're better stocked, and you've got even more to lose. It just adds to the feeling. Now if you beat #10 and find a bonfire (hurrah!), you'll have over 30000 souls to spend. You had more of a struggle, but in the end you reaped more out of it too - extra souls, more familiarity with the enemies' attacks and your own, and generally just a little more skill to continue playing the game. Resting at that bonfire will first give you a wave of relief, and then it'll be replaced by a boost in confidence and an eagerness to play more, explore further and find out what challenge awaits you next. Its an addicting feeling.

&gt; So with my 3 diamond masterpieces I've unlocked (83 - 3)/3 ~= 170 new maps to collect (-3 because I had to destroy 3 glass monuments to make them).

I will soon provide an automated way to pick them up - don't waste your time doing them manually.  (And a reason to have more).

&gt; We'd get the 342nd masterpiece on NP 2229, and it would cost:
     300S diamonds over 4,971.155 NP (yes, almost 5,000 hours) to make the mould
     11KQ diamonds per mNP for 2,229 mNP (24MQ diamonds total) to fill the mould
     Infinite coal or diamonds (coal requirement goes infinite at NP 1483) per mNP for 47 mNP to cook the mould
     11KQ vacuums per mNP for 334 mNP (3MQ vacuums total) to burnish the mould*
     300S diamonds, infinite coal, and 11KQ vacuums (values are from the steps above) over 122 mNP

There will boosts along the way to have more stuff and reduce the time.

&gt; One thing I noticed is that Molpy.Boosts['DMC'].CookTime doesn't round the value it outputs (it should do a ceil I think). That makes Muse's display a little unpleasant, but I don't think it really affects anything much.

That is a simple bug.

&gt; Also, mounting a pedestal will lock Black Powder even if you can't currently afford to start mounting the pedestal. I'd recommend changing the followind lines in Molpy.Boosts.DMP.StartPed:

Done - thanks.

&gt; There also seem to be a few inconsistencies with whether each part of the masterpiece process requires resources and time or resources per mNP for a time. It looks like cooking doesn't actually require resources every mNP (which makes it substantially more manageable).

Think about the Hadesean artifact they mentioned. That is just a taste of Indiana Jones like exploration mechanics that could be enabled by having languages. Yes that is not one of the 'big 3' alien cultures, but it is all interrelated. 

Consider:  
* collecting enough samples of a 'dead' language to be able to translate something that then leads you to an undiscovered jump point or 'the city of gold'  
* collecting enough to be able to build a translator program for your mobiglass that you could then sell to other explorers  
* Billboards and announcements on Banu or xi'an planets that your translator program has a hard time with but if you know enough of the language to puzzle it out might lead you to limited sales or mission opportunities you might have overlooked otherwise.  
* Conversation system where your ability to respond appropriately with the correct (Banu, Xi'an) expression might grant you that bit of extra reputation boost with an alien NPC or shopkeeper.

It's a good discussion, usually the complaint I find is people joined the cycle late, so what they *really* want DayZ to be like Epoch hence why they're putting all their eggs in the H1Z1 basket. (fanboyism aside, Arcadey Rust/WarZ microtransaction laden is NOT for me! but i see why people are fingers crossed that it's good).

It's weird, because I'm gonna say I actually *liked* the inventory system on Arma 2, or grew to tolerate it perhaps. I'll answer your points  as non bias as I can from someone who played the mod for fuck, over 2 years now :/

&gt;zombies are a huge part of the game

&gt;Server performance and zombies

agreed on the first point. i'm not gonna say SA&gt;&gt;Mod in this respect, but all I can say is they *will* be.  i mean, for what it's worth, on some occasions they're fucking irritating in the standalone too (in a good way). especially if you're juggling a AKM/M4 combo with an Amphibia with no mag and you have 3 on you. 

second point, which *may* answer a few of your other points with server/performance is yes, you've probably heard me say this before, but the reason is because everything is server side. in the mod, the zombies would spawn in what, a 200m bubble on YOU. so, your client. same with loot. hence why loot farming was a ''thing'', and why you could tell if someone was in a town just by looking. right now, the Standalone servers are choked. Literally, NavMesh, Zombie Count, Physics right down to the responsiveness of the hotbar/desync are relying on yes...64bit. Sounds like a cop out, but it's really not. I've said before, if we had seen no evidence of them *close* to that, then sure...''dude, what the fuck is going on Rocket?'', but we've seen internal testing, them on Exp (but not, um, ''switched on) and the profiler ran collecting data recently (like, Monday?) So I see progress that solves like 50% of peoples issues at least as they're all connected.

&gt;humanity

Have you seen the [Breaking Point system?](http://breakingpointmod.com/wiki/index.php?title=Factions). Here's the out of date ish wiki, but you get the jist. It's actually surprisingly decent - Heroes, Bandits, Outlaws, Hermit types. You gain ''points'' from performing actions ''relevant'' to your Character, and move up/down from Level 1-3 and receive a small regen ''boost'' or a better backpack on spawn. So, if a Hero kills a Hero/Nearly any class, less points. Hero gives medicine to a Hero, gain points. Hero kills a Bandit, gain points. You get the idea - and the ''group'' channel is connected to your ''class'', so you can ''call fellow Heroes'' or as the Bandits say ''I've seen xxx go to xxx, kill them''. You CAN choose ''None'' though.

*However*, I don't think this is something we're likely to see in the Standalone, just because I feel Rocket wants to keep it more ''player driven'' rather than pidgeonholing people into classes with levels and points and that stuff. That's fair enough, imo, but I do enjoy the Breaking Point system (matter fact I've got it Alt Tabbed now).

&gt;Player base: the SA, due in part to the incomplete nature of an alpha game, has attracted a completely different demographic than vanilla DayZ did

This is my BIGGEST gripe with the SA. Honestly, I'm with you on this one. Luckily, Private Hives all but remedy this 100% and it's not totally the SA's fault. It also kinda goes hand in hand with your complaint about interaction @ high traffic areas and the ''CIRCLE OF DEATH'' at Kab/Stary/NWAF/Vybor. My fondest moments in game are DayZero, in those precise places with huge 20-30 minute squad fights. I totally agree with you on this, I hate the whole Berezino culture, I hate the fact that it's become so popular now it's drawn not the ''wrong crowd'', but just more immaturity and people who expected this to be like a Dead Rising MMO. But, even now it's slowly getting there imo. People are moving a bit more since Heli Crashes, and I'm finding every barracks looted now for the AKM's. As they add more players and make the loot more diverse so NWAF is the ''go to'' place for the rare shit, it'll improve.

&gt;we hardly ever see anyone at NWAF on SA.

it was like that for me for the first...5 months. I got to about Feb and was like, fuck this - back on Breaking Point. But like I said, this is easily remedied - I'm waiting patiently for a ZOMBIES.NU Private Hive, which is 60% organized squads, 20% good lonewolves and the rest just minding their own business. DayZero Hive will be NUTS with the new medicial/attachments system &amp; all the little things like loading mags. And again, sounding like a broken record but it's slowly getting there. I logged in both my HC and Regular characters at NWAF, and within 15-20 minutes both times I heard gunfights going down. Like, actual...real, people returning fire, gunfights. I loved it. 

All I can say is all of these issues are ''close to being fixed'', ''will be fixed'' or ''will easily be remedied by mods'' (look what they did with Epoch/Origins and even Breaking Point with it's humanity system). Of course, it's not RIGHT NOW...but it will be - which I totally understand due to the nature of the game right now and I'm just waiting patiently. I'm not saying modding should patch up the ''inadequate devs'', but like Arma, I would be more than happy for the Standalone to be a ''solid platform'' for modding - I would be happy just with that. I know at times I may sound like I play this game 24/7, but I've logged about an hour in the past week.

welcome on a great road back to Demon Hunting.

So I would like to help you answering those questions.

&gt; I see people with less damage...

In Patch 2.0 a new affix has been implemented: Elemental Spell Damage. To see what I mean please take a look at [This Awesome Chest Armor](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/item/cindercoat). This is awesome Armor that will not only increase your Fire Spells damage, by up to 20% (level 70 version), but also reduce Hatred and Discipline cost of your fire spells. It can be single best upgrade you could possibly get now. Also, the trick with RoS is: because +% Fire affix boosts only few of your skills (and not total damage like CC or CD), it is NOT INCLUDED in tooltip and ""Damage"" value you see on your character sheet! If you will find, for example an Amulet with +15% Fire, and tooltip will say it actually reduces your damage by -7%, you need to remember, that your Cluster arrow with that amulet will actually hit 100% - 7% + 15% ~= 108% so it will be stronger than before. Actual formula includes multiplication, so I simplified it a bit.

Total amount of +% Fire Spell Damage you can get with full set of ""Fire"" items is +120%, but that's a very-late game goal. For now, I would suggest you focusing just on the play and simply collect items, to figure out, if they are creating any interesting setups.

#### Item tips

Now, I would like to comment on the items you already have, and how to utilize it bit more:

* Your bracers give you 24% situational damage increase, so to use it please focus on two spells. Rain of Vengeance - Stampede (keeps all enemies away, and gives you increased damage to the enemies for over 8 seconds) and Vault - Rattling Roll, knocks backs and stuns enemies you roll through. Perfect if you have been walled in by ""waller"" affix, you just roll through him, and have 24% increased damage from your Strongarm Bracers. The only thing that is left on your bracers is ""+[15-20]% Fire Spells Damage"" affix, but you can modify items now. Please answer below, if you know how ENCHANTING works? If you do, I would reroll Vitality into Fire damage, and your bracers would be Best-In-Slot item for Damage.
* Quiver: Unfortunately, the quiver you've found is very very bad. The Bleed effect, doesn't stack, it can only refresh, and it deals small ticks of damage over 5-second period of time. Which basically equals to 72% of your weapon damage by second if the bleed procs. To compare how much damage it is, the Spider companion and Bat companion are both dealing 100% of your weapon damage per second, so if you will summon them, and let them ""kill the monster alone"" you will know how is this Bleed working. Worst part of your quiver, is that it is missing the most important and useful stat: 10% Crit Chance. Also Sockets are negligible, because the bonus Dex is just ""a small tip"" on a quiver, and is far less effective than: Hatred Regen, Max Discipline, +% Skill damage, +% Elite Damage, and some other. Perfect quiver would have high Dex, CC, AS (all of them have it), and Max Discipline (this is secondary affix). I would suggest switching your quiver with a yellow version that has crit.
* I have no more tips about your current gear, other modifications would include a lot of Enchanting, but I think that it's better to be patient, save your Enchanting Materials and Gold, and reroll near-perfect item into perfect one, instead of throwing all your resources at Myriam hoping for a shitty item to become legendary.

#### Spell tips

Your build is very very solid (maybe only missing thing is a good Discipline Spender), ofc when you will discover the ""+% Fire Spell"" affix, or find Cindercoat, your build will change a lot. So far I encourage you to build around the items you currently have. As mentioned above

* Rain of Vengeance - Stampede, is awesome spell with short cooldown to keep monsters away, avoid ANY damage (that's why DHs doesn't need much resistance), and proc your Strongarm's 24% damage increase.
* Vault - Rattling Roll, is better than Tumble, because you can proc Strongarms, and have second way to Crowd Control (stun and knockback) enemies.
* Vengeance - From the Shadows, this new spell is like fireworks show, I love it! Unfortunately, besides good visual effects it doesn't work that good. Ofc feel free to use it whenever you like, but for me, Vengeance could be replaced with a more defensive spell.
* Second Defensive spell (Vault is your 1st one), Smoke Screen! So, you clearly are using Vengeance to keep monsters away from you and avoid damage. But this spell won't save you from Arcane Sentry or Frozen, Thunderstorm or Orbiter affixes. You need something to dodge, and Smoke Screen is best option because it will synergize with your HELM (which is very awesome item, btw). By pressing your 4 keyboard hotkey you can dodge projectiles, avoid Butcher's hook, stand in place bypassing Arcane Spikes, and continue dishing out your damage with Pride's Fall buff. I suggest you trying out different runes and picking up the one you like most.

#### Passive skills tips

* Ambush might seem awesome, but the truth is: it increases 40% of your damage, that equals to 25% of enemy monster's HP if your hit was greater by that value. It doesn't increase FULL damage you deal if hit is exceeding this amount. For example, hitting a rat with 10mln HP by a Cluster Arrow that deals 5mln with Ambush passive will deal 40% * 2,5mln = 1mln bonus damage, and not 40% * 5mln = 2mln. That's a big difference. I suggest switching it with for example Bloody Vengeance, because then, collecting Health Globes will help you to shoot more Cluster Arrows, and thus boost your damage by a substantial amount.
* Steady Aim - it is really fine passive, but sometimes I switch it with the Cull The Weak (notice, you can rotate Entangling Shot with Cluster Arrow, and you will be dealing 20% increased damage no matter where the enemies are (and you will be to combine this passive with Rattling Roll: rolling through the elite to stun him, and then deal +20% damage to stunned enemy. This combo wouldn't be possible with Steady Aim, and from my personal experience, a single Zombie that stands close to you makes this passive useless, I'm talking about those situations, when you need to ignore the Zombie, and kill quickly the Master of Evil standing behind him, but this little Zombie ""weakens"" your Steady Aim. It is really ""kill or be killed"" tactic.

Overall, I wish you having fun and great loot, and I'm really happy you picked Demon Hunters to play in D3.

Kind Regards,

~Vill

EDIT:

One side note: Playing higher torment levels really tampers ""speed &amp; efficiency"" play in Diablo 3. When you turn up the Torment higher, you will have to sacrifice your damage in order to survive engagements. You might feel, that more Vitality would be helpful, but from my experience it's better to dodge stuff, than hope to survive when attacked. Notice, that you cannot easily ""face-tank"" anything, no matter how much toughness you have (DH builds with shields were popular on Hardcore mode, but it was not efficient at all).

For more insight on the efficiency please watch this amazing and clever explanation (posted a while ago, but his ideas are still true) inside this video. It is full of important information, but I would like to emphasize the 5:20 mark, about efficiency vs difficulty:

Blessing might take a little bit more time to set up, but you don't have to micro-manage it like with Link.

Trinity's current skill set is already fairly passive. I wouldn't say Link is a damaging ability. With enemies' health and damage output as it is, it's difficult to kill any enemy before you go down unless you juggle Quick Thinking+Blessing+Link for even more damage reduction. 

Defensive buffs work in traditional MMOs, but I have some doubts about how well it works in Warframe, where a rigid team formation is not the norm. PSO2 is somewhat similar to Warframe in gameplay - hack and slash, a bit more skill required, characters don't move as quickly. The Techer support class has abilities that boost the duration and range of auras (base duration 15 seconds), but it's really only used for enhancing one offensive aura that affects *enemies.* Everyone else is still too busy running around.

Also, running around quickly on the edge of the fight killing everything in your path is actually a fairly efficient way of avoiding damage. Having everyone stick together like in a (Mobile) Defense isn't necessarily a solution, especially when some frames can move faster than others, some people want to go into melee range while others don't, etc. 

Trying to force cooperation rarely works - even with something like Rhino's Roar or Banshee's Sonar, or Loki's Radial Disarm, people will run off and just shoot other stuff. Radial Disarm arguably reduces the damage allies take, and makes their jobs easier. 

*****

One way to do this, however, would be to change Link up even more. Very complicated, but it'd be a support spell that has a **fun** damage component, that I think most people here would like. 

* Link can target up to two allies, with infinite range, and absorb 50% of the damage they take.

* If Link is active, you have 50% damage reduction, scaling with power strength to a cap of 85%. Can be cast without a target, in which case it will affect you and spread to the first ally that walks within a certain range for the remaining duration. 

* Link will collected the mitigated damage, which has a cap that scales with Power Strength.

* Casting Link on an enemy will unleash the mitigated damage - knocks down the target as well. Costs no energy. (Alternatively, unleash the damage around you in an AOE for an additional energy cost, but that feels too much like Absorb.) 

To note: You can achieve 65% damage reduction with purely Intensify like this. Combine with Blind Rage for a tanky Trinity who doesn't have to rely on Blessing - the boosted energy from EV can help cover the energy costs.

Damage absorption via defensive buff is fun, tactical, and I've seen it used to great effect in League of Legends. Drop a support buff on allies to make them last longer, sure. Make it do damage as a secondary feature? Yes. Very yes. 

You do lose a little damage output with this suggestion, since it's limited to one target instead of multiple. But you also get to save up a big burst of damage for a heavy unit. But the best thing: you don't have a continuous chain of deathray numbers coming out from Trinity, so she's not just mowing down enemies by watching them shoot themselves.

*****

On tank Trinity: IMO, a build that isn't broken shouldn't be removed from the game. Yes, she may be able to take damage more effectively than Rhino... hm. Can she? 

... yeah. But Blessing as it is right now can also do the same thing, and make your entire team invulnerable. It just takes a lot more work to do, rather than spamming Blessing the second it goes down. You'd have to get yourself down to low health before reapplying, and make sure that you have enough energy to get that up. 

As a straight-up tank, Valkyr would be the best at taking damage. She's immune to knockdowns in Hysteria and invulnerable, and it lasts a VERY long time if you spec for it. 

Mm, I admit that Blessing + current Link turns Trinity into a ridiculous tank, though I'm still doubtful that it puts out enough damage to be a huge issue. Possible fix to this would be to calculate reflected damage after Blessing's damage reduction, so you'd have to be taking 25% of the damage you deal to enemies. At most, roughly 6k damage (roughly 5 shots from a Boltor Prime!) before you need to pop Blessing and heal yourself. ",2,Kuryaka,True,t3_2as40e,0,ciyqb7v,0,1434738047,

Poland, one of the best civs in the game (arguably the best). Easily one of the most versatile civs which is best show by the chart [posted yesterday.](http://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/21o6ci/civ_5_power_chart/) The strategy below was originally created by tommyt in the [civfanatics](http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=501378) forums, but it's a little hard to read and i've also changed a few things around. I have used it on difficulty 6 and 7 with absolute prowess and I am sure it would work on deity as well. Here it goes.

---

**Capital Build Order**

- Scout 

- Scout 

With these two scouts, you need to explore like crazy. This strategy can really work with any start, but obviously getting those ruins and city states is a big part of it. Here are the main things you want with the scouts. *2 religious city states* and *1 population and 1 culture ruin.* Even without these you can still excel, but getting the religious city states to give you gold and (hopefully) a pantheon will really help. The culture is probably the best ruin to get, and the population ruin will just help overall. With your warrior, set him up outside of a city state and wait for them to build a worker. Take the warrior and make peace immediately afterwards. 

-  Shrine (if you haven't already gotten a pantheon)

- Monument

- Worker

- Warrior/scout/granary (really depends on the situation, if you want to defend from barbarians get a a warrior, if not get a scout, and if not get a granary)

- Library 

- 2 Setters when you get collective rule


*Wonders*

The main thing your going to want is the Oracle for that free social policy, and national college after the oracle. After, try to get possibly pyramids if they aren't taken yet, or the hagia sophia for a free great prophet. The sistine chapel and porcelain tower are the other two wonders you wan't to try to get.

---

**New City Build Order**

*Always try to get 2 or 3 workable luxuries in all of your new cities. Next to a mountain and a river would be ideal, but obviously you can't always get that. Just try to put your cities 7-ish tiles apart to avoid tile overlapping and to maximize your land. Of course sometimes there will be some exceptions, but use your best judgement.*

- Monument

- Library (purchase if your trying to hurry up national college)

- Caravan (Focus on those science trade routes)

- Worker

- Ducal Stables

---

**Tech Order**

- Pottery

- Animal Husbandry

- Mining/trapping (depends on what luxuries you have)

- Beeline Philosophy 

- Drama and Poetry

- Education

*Another thing to note, you will be ignoring the lower tech tree for quite some time, which means you have to watch out for neighboring civs. Your military won't be quite up to par so try to keep good relationships up until pikeman at least. Also since you will be ignoring the bottom, your caravans will produce a good amount of science.*

---

**Religion** *(If you get one).*

*Usually I have been able to secure a religion in my games, even without Hagia Sophia. It's not an integral part of the strategy so don't worry if you can't get one.*

*For your pantheon:*

- Try to get a faith booster like desert folklore.

- If you have a decent amount of a specific resource, like wine for example, get the pantheon that best suits your needs

- If no faith boosting ones are available and none of the others seem optimal, get Fertility Rites. 

*Religion:*

-  I usually try to get Tithe for my founder belief, doesn't really matter in my opinion.

Follower Belief: 

- Swords into plowshares

- Feed the World

- Religious Community 

- Remember to always optimize your picks. This outline is just that, an outline. If you have a bunch of wine and incense, get monasteries. Things like that.

Enhancer: 

- Again, not a huge deal, but I usually go with Religious texts. 

---

**Social Policies**

Here we go, this is the main part of the strategy. 

- Tradition (just the opener) 

- Liberty

 Republic

 Collective Rule (Once you get this settler remember, buy and build 2 more)

- Tradition

 Aristocracy (getting aristocracy should coincide with building the oracle)

 Legalism (Don't get legalism if you don't have a monument in every other one of your cities, so that your free culture building is an amphitheater. If you don't, pick the next liberty policy in the tree. )

 Landed elite

 Monarchy

 Oligarchy

- If you get any more policies before the renascence era, try to finish out liberty for a free great scientist which you can use to build an academy. 

- Once you unlock it, get and fill rationalism.

*Ideology*

For ideology, it really depends on what you think is best. I think freedom and order are best for this strategy, so far I have gone with order, but I think freedom might be another viable choice. 

---

Using this strategy, you will be a cultural, economic, and scientific powerhouse, hence the name of this strategy. You can really go for any victory using this strategy, and I usually go for science victories. I'm not the best player, and I'm sure there are many more things that can be done to improve this. [Here's](http://forums.civfanatics.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=355393&amp;d=1373726019) a screenshot of tommyt using this strategy. He reaches the modern era on turn 157 on deity, my best has been 215 on immortal. This strategy works with any start, and is one of the best to prove how versatile Poland really is. Any questions?

let's look at the ENTIRE page you pulled that quote from:

&gt;History, Academic Studies Suggest Tax Cuts **Won’t Work in Long Run** 
Substantial evidence suggests that **deep tax cuts are a 
poor strategy to expand state economies.** 
 
&gt; * Other states’ experiences. In the 1990s and 
2000s, several states slashed personal income taxes 
in hopes of economic revitalization. **The results 
were disappointing.** For example, the six states 
that cut taxes by more than 10 percent of revenue 
in the 1990s created **fewer jobs, and had slower 
income growth**, than the rest of the country over 
the next full economic cycle (2000-2007).
27
 
 
&gt; * Academic research. The vast majority of 
empirical academic studies conducted by 
economists over the last 40 years find that 
interstate differences in tax levels, including 
differences in personal income taxes, have little if 
any effect on relative rates of state economic 
growth. Of the eight major studies published in 
academic journals since 2000 that examined the 
broad economic effect of state personal income tax 
levels, six found no significant effects and one of the others produced internally inconsistent 
results.28
 
 
&gt; * The cuts in Kansas were especially poorly designed to promote growth. In particular, 
**eliminating taxes on pass-through income is very unlikely to boost economic growth.** Many of 
the businesses that will collect this tax break have no employees, some of the shareholders who 
will collect the benefit are out of state, and firms need not create a single new job to qualify for 
the tax break. Even Kansas firms with employees are **unlikely to add jobs or produce more 
products unless they see demand increase, regardless of the tax cut**.29
 
and by the way, if you bothered to look at the footnoted study that paragraph you so cleverly fingered actually references, you'll see that they're talking about a supposed consensus in academic literature that states tax cuts boost state economies.  that's what brownback is claiming by implementing these cuts.  the opinions are actually all over the place, saying ""yes this might help"", ""this isn't going to have any effect either way"", and ""no, this is not going to help and is going to be bad for all involved.""  but there is no consensus that tax cuts are good for growth.

The problem with this is it would completely remove the incentive to ever collect new cards for many, many players, myself included. For us, Arena is almost literally the only reason to play this game. I have never spent a single gold or dollar on booster packs: 100% of it goes to Arenas, and I only care about what I get from boosters for the sake of those times I'm between arena matches (doesn't happen too often anymore) or can't complete my dailies with my current arena pick, and have to use constructed decks. Naxx is going to be fun for a bit, but after I've finished it all on heroic it would require some strong incentive for me to play it again rather than go back to chaining arenas.

Blizzard knows all this. What they MIGHT do is put a free arena where your draft picks only come from the cards you have, but that would be very cheesable for anyone willing to just d/e the cards they don't want to show up.

What I really want to see is Arena vs friends. Each person pays 10g to draft a new Arena deck used only against friends, which they keep until it loses once. A player should also be able to pay another's Friend Arena draft fee.

This provides a cheap and fun arena format, and lets players play against eachother in an ""equal"" footing.

As for the Oculus gear itself, its considered ""legacy"" gear now. Its a good, easy-to-get temporary gearset, but its base stats and enchantment rolls are vastly inferior to the newly released gear. And since Corsair's Stronghold and Kumasylum are equalized, it doesn't matter what gear you have when you enter those battlegrounds.

Do not feel like you ruined you relationship by allowing her to post pics on gonewild. It only put her fidelity to the test and she failed. My opinion is she would cheat anyway at some point. Had it not been for the pics, it would have been with the next guy that showed interest in her. Maybe a coworker, a ""friend"" or whatever. It's good that it happened now that you can simply collect all her belongings in trash bags, because if it happened later the break up process could be much more complicated, involving joint bank accounts, lawyers and kids (whew!).

Is there any reason you haven't included Umbral Mantle/Staff of Domination? They go infinite with half the deck. There is also Sword of the Paruns, but I don't run it because of the relatively high cost. 

Thousand-Year elixir is another pseudo haste enabler that you're missing, can combo off the turn you play this pretty often. 

Joraga Treespeaker is an excellent first turn drop, I rarely level it beyond the first level though.

Wirewood Hivemaster is a card that I'm rarely disappointed to see come up. The insects it makes aren't particularly useful by themselves but when you consider that cards like Cradle, Slate of Ancestry, Regal Force, Craterhoof, Earthcraft, etc only care about the number of creatures in play and not whether they're Elves...it can get pretty crazy. 

Quirion Ranger could replace Scryb Ranger since it has the benefit of being an Elf and a lower cost, but no flash. 

I like Skullclamp in my deck but I only run two Elf lords so my guys tend to be clampable more often than not, which might not be the case for you. It goes really well with insect tokens created with Wirewood Hivemaster since they don't get boosted by lords and are totally expendable.

I've started playing Winter Orb recently and it has been amazing, it can quite easily soft lock people out of the game when dropped a few turns in and since our mana comes predominantly from our creatures and Cradle it barely slows me down. You'll need a bucket ready to collect all of the tears though so keep that in mind.

Natural Order is a great card, it usually fetches Craterhoof, Regal Force or a big mana Elf if I have some haste on the field. It used to fetch turn 2 or 3 Sylvan Primordials which was disgusting, R.I.P Sylvan.

As for actual changes to your deck I would swap Relic Crush out for Nature's Claim because while a two for one can be really nice, 5 mana is a pretty steep. 

I'm not a big fan of Glissa, she only hits artifacts, can't be used the turn she's played without some sort of haste, and her cost is pretty high for an elf. I would personally swap her out for Reclamation Sage. 

How has Eladamri been working out for you? I had him in early versions of my deck but he backfired on me every single time I played him by cutting off the ability to regen my dudes, untap them with abilities etc etc. 

Very nice deck list you have there man, hope my wall of text is readable and doesn't come off as rude. I'll update my Elf list and post it up in a little bit so maybe we can compare.

It's a very basic overview of the important stuff.  But here are some general things that will hopefully be of some help:

* Blue Mushrooms + Herb = Potion (decent healing)
* Potion + Honey = Mega Potion (great healing)  Keep 10 Potions and 10 Mega Potions on you at all times.  All the ingredients you need can be obtained in the Moga Woods and they can be farmed as well.
* Combat is meant to be slow and planned; you're not in a hack and slash.  Running up and spamming the attack button will get you mauled.  The key to becoming a better hunter is to wait, observe the Monster, play it safe until they leave themselves open, then strike a few times and go back on the defensive.
* Keep your farm running.  This will save you time gathering a ton of necessary stuff (you'll go through Potions like mad)
* Keep doing Village Quests.  They start out mundane (collecting stuff, slaying 10 small monsters, etc.) but this is to get you used to how your weapon works, the layout of the map, the necessity of gathering, and so on.
* Pick a weapon that works for you.  You start with one of each weapon type (12 in total) in your item box.  Try them all out!  I played with the Longsword for a while until I tried the Gunlance and had an absolute blast (literally).  The game is actually wildly different depending on which weapon you're using; it changes your entire playstyle.  A good beginner weapon is the Sword and Shield; it has a little of everything (defense, mobility, speed, power) so you can get used to a more fluid combat experience.
* Learn about armor skills.  The Pro Jared videos will go over them, but basically, Armor gives you a bit of defense, yeah, but the most important aspect are the skills.  You don't want to mix/match random armor pieces, instead go for a full set (A full Jaggi set or a full Rhenoplas set) since each piece will give you points towards the same skills.  A skill doesn't activate until it hits +10.  For instance, the Jaggi gloves might give you +3 Attack, and the Jaggi Helm might give you +2 Attack, and so on; the full set gives a total of +13 Attack;  Since it broke the ""10"" barrier, the skill ""Attack Up(s)"" is activated, giving your character a damage boost.
* Once you learn the ropes, try going online.  I wouldn't recommend going online until you have beaten the Barroth, since you don't want to be a burden to your team and you want to at least know the basics.  But once you do go online, it's a great environment to learn about the monsters and participate in a ton of hunts and understand the aspects of working together (plus you'll get to observe how other people hunt, which can teach you quite a bit)

Most importantly; stick it out!  The game has a rough start because it's trying to teach you 1000 things at once and it really does a half-ass job at teaching most of them (unfortunately).  But once you hit a point a few hours in, the game just ""clicks"" and you'll find yourself addicted.  Keep at it!",6,breadrising,True,t3_2aphd2,0,cixq6v4,0,1434720328,

Kilmer Aced is a waste of points imo, you're better off reloading behind cover when your armour is regenerating and standing still while firing isn't a hard thing to do.

Well, I did play some CS so I usually stand still while shooting. Regardless I don't think moving affects accuracy that much for most 18+ accuracy guns, except for Sniper Rifles.

I can't believe you don't have Spotter. That perk is amazing, you get a 15% damage buff on Specials for you &amp; your entire team. It's a must for MasterForcers.

Also, you need Dominator. If somebody gets into custody, as a Mastermind you need to get that player back on your team. You're not always going to have hostages to trade.

Joker Basic is pretty useless because cops tend to die fairly quickly. It's not worth the effort converting guards, not worth the 4 points either.

I'd recommend getting Fast Learned aced so you can level up quicker, and finish the Infamy grind faster.

Cat Burglar isn't that useful. If you take shortcuts, I find that you can still take them, you just lose a little bit of health. Most stealth missions will not require you to take these shortcuts, and I don't really see a need for you to jump around everywhere when going loud.

Nerves of Steel is a great skill, but you can save your skill points and get Overkill basic. This is an amazing Shotgun perk for going loud, you get a 5s bonus 75% damage buff. This makes you a near-unstoppable killing machine. You will absolutely love this skill if you're big on shotguns. This is one of the Enforcer skills that makes this tree really shine.

Fully Loaded Aced is an awesome skill, but you have a Locomotive shotgun. With good ammo conservation, you can use up all your primary gun ammo, then switch back to your secondary shotgun and collect all the ammo drops to refill. As a MasterForcer myself, I never have a problem with ammo. I can safely say I almost never touch an ammo bag during loud missions.

With my critique, I've recreated a build for you:

If you have the Sniper Rifle DLC, feel free to remove the 8 points from Shield Bashing. You didn't specify which primary weapon you use, so I went ahead and spent it there. You can even take those 8 points and ace Kilmer if you really like that skill.

I got the Saw for you, because that is a very important tool to have as an Enforcer. It speeds up heists a lot. Don't focus on H&amp;T deposit boxes, think GenSec doors, Election Day cages, Armoured Transports, Firestarter Day 1 + 2, etc.

Fine, you enjoy Fully Loaded Aced? Alright buddy, I've left it aced in my 2nd edit of your build. You also have 8 points left, so go ahead and spend that wherever you want.

http://pd2skills.info/profile/masterforcer-first-try-spade02

You got a couple of options, these are the ones I recommend:

1) Spend 8 points on getting Shield Bash. Comes in handy if you don't have a primary Sniper Rifle to deal with pesky Shields.

2) Spend 4 points on Overkill Basic. I've already explained why this is such a great skill, but to put more emphasis on it... it allows you room for error. Instead of needing to headshot all the law enforcers, you can start bodyshotting cops. You'll be able to hold a chokepoint with ease.

With 4 more points left, feel free to buy whatever you want. Saw is a good choice, BUT you can re-buy Nerves of Steel in the Tech Tree (which will cost 2 points, leaving you 2 more to go). You can re-buy Cat Burglar if you must, and spend the last point in Cleaner Basic! It gives you a 5% extra boost of Damage, which will be helpful if you need to use the Locomotive against Bulldozers (to be specific, when their glass visor is off).

I have 750+ hours in this game, which I spent half my time as TechForcer. Around early April, Gage Mod Courier DLC came out and I explored MasterForcer. It's a really great class/build to play, and I've constantly messed around with my skills and weapon builds.

I hope you take my advice into consideration, and I hope you will have fun succeeding heists with ease.

Just attach them to a 1 second timer, etc. I still believe that the destroyer will be the easiest. I'm assuming hellfire arrows wouldn't be allowed. Here's what you need to do, or at least what I would do. 

Accessories:

Star veil

Obsidian Shield

Lightning boots or some other form of boots


For your last two accessories, you have some options. Personally, I would go with a Moon stone if possible, along with a charm of myths.


Obviously all of your accessories need to be reforged to warding. I'm fairly sure that damage boosts on reforging don't affect the damage of explosives. 

If you are allowed to use summoning weapons, I would recommend using the pirate staff. It has the highest damage. Reforge it to ruthless for max damage.

IF YOU CAN USE SUMMONING WEAPONS, use Oricalthum armor. The set bonus is extremely helpful against the destroyer in your situation. If that isn't allowed, your other option is titanium armor. The melee set, for maximum defense, of course. If you're able to use a nimbus rod, which I doubt, use that, along with a crimson rod. 

You will need to use the following potions to aid you in actually doing this:

Endurance Potion

Heartreach Potion

Inferno Potion

Ironskin Potion

Lifeforce Potion

Rage Potion (I don't know if an explosive can crit an enemy, but it might help, right?)

Regeneration Potion

Summoning Potion (Assuming you can use summoning items. If you can, use 2 pirate minions. They do the most damage. Reforge the staff to ruthless too)

Swiftness Potion

Thorns Potion

Wrath Potion (Again, don't know if this applies to explosives, but why not?)

Bowl of Soup (in order to get the well-fed bonus)

Greater Healing Potions for maximum health regen.

You're going to need to use dynamite to make explosives if you want to have a chance of winning. Basically, set up a long, long sky bridge across your entire world. Not necessarily, but you get the drift. What I would do is make this bridge out of hardmode ores. As annoying as that might be to collect, dynamite/explosives don't blow them up. You need to wire every block of that bridge with explosives, wire them all to various switches that trigger sections of the explosives. You're going to want to lead the destroyer so that he will end up following you horizontally across your bridge. Explode a section so that every explosive hits multiple sections due to him being horizontal. This should basically just do shittons of damage. Repeat until he is dead. Use potions as needed. Wire any heart statues you have to multiple timers across your entire bridge so that you can collect them as you run and kite him. In addition, make sure you have a constant regeneration buff from both campfires and heart lanterns, along with having occasional pools of honey to dip into. Once you've set this up, just let the chase begin. Fill your inventory with dynamite, and do what I suggested. I believe it should work. If you lack money, find a jellyfish statue, create an automatic farm and sell the jellyfish necklaces for a huge profit to buy your dynamite. 

I realize that this was probably extremely long and not what you were expecting, but here you go. If anybody has any other suggestions, comments, questions, let me know.

* First, a lot of the things you mentioned aren't exactly easy data to collect, or aren't really something you can easily measure

* You'll probably have a lot of response bias, but that's with any study and hopefully would be noted or controlled in the rankings
* Schools are already sweeping things under the rug already, how do you prevent them from misreporting?
* How do you encourage schools to go to the police with this manner and allow them to follow the due process of the law (while the school is assisting where asked an needed) when you have rankings like this? It could very well encourage the mishandling of cases just to boost their ranking.

Those were the four words that William Brighthat had heard a thousand times before today, though always spoken from a fictional mouth, or one in jest. He never thought he'd be given occasion to say those four words in plain sincerity, let alone that the men who called him ""brother"" not a full day before would take them to heart without a second thought. Knowing what was behind them, he could only half blame them.  

Brighthat remembered discarding his rifle once he'd discovered he was out of magazines, though he couldn't place the moment he'd lost his sidearm. It'd be of little use now, he thought, though he knew he would have felt safer with it on his person. He was bleeding profusely, his right leg painted a uniform, disgusting shade of crimson from the length of shrapnel that he'd taken to his outer thigh. He'd kept himself moving on pure adrenaline until his strength began to fail from the bloodloss. Now that he'd been left incapacitated, the pain was beginning to set upon him as well. He couldn't help but feel a little proud he'd made it as far as he had on the wounded leg.

His last words echoed through his mind. It occurred to him that all of the most meaningful phrases a man might ever speak were no more than ten words in length. He thought about that. It had taken four words to seal his fate, five syllables to die alone and in pain. ""I love you"" was only three, and ""I do"" was two. His leg throbbed weakly. 

The minute Brighthat had looked down and seen his wound, he had known his life was over. It was hard to process any thought beyond primal instinct in the firefight, but some small part of him had to have known, in the back of his mind. He hadn't had the time for the grave reality of the situation to set in before Booster had pulled him to his feet and shoved him in the general direction of safety. 

Booster had been his platoon's medic. Booster wasn't his real name; Brighthat had never learned the details of the story that had inspired the nickname, though he'd known it had something to do with vaccinating an intoxicated off-duty officer who'd been bitten by a raccoon. Brighthat had always thought of the position as a futile one; When the shit hit the fan, what good could some quack-shit prostate doctor do in the middle of a shitstorm? he'd thought. Had he the time to collect his thoughts, he might have reconsidered his position on the matter. He'd never had the opportunity to thank him for what he'd done, as the better part of Booster's head had been blown off of it's shoulders not fifteen seconds after picking him up and sending him on his way. He didn't have time to consider that, he had to move. Otherwise Booster would have died for nothing.

He thought now. These were going to be his last few minutes on Earth. What else could he do but think? He thought about the nameless men who'd supported him on their shoulders along their trek through what had once been a shopping mall. He hadn't known them, but there was always a sense of comradery among all of the ground forces. We'd taken up this charge knowing we'd be the first ones to get fucked when everything went to shit, he thought. The men he'd bunked with had lead their lives with a peculiar sense of reckless abandon, carrying on madly like a fraternity of men who knew they'd die tomorrow, though never forgetting their duty. They had known that they weren't fighting and dying for political or territorial gains. International disputes over sources of water and medicine had lost their justification after everybody had lost everything in the invasion.

Martians, Brighthat had always called them, usually drunkenly, though he'd known they couldn't have been from Mars. Nobody had known where they came from. Every world power had been sent into a flight of hysterics whenever the majority of the water went bad. People grew sickly and weak and died, either to the wars over whatever remaining resources could be scavenged or simply to their own deteriorating health. Once the extraterrestrials had touched down, many people had suspected that there was a correlation between the two events, Brighthat foremost and loudest among them. He'd seized the opportunity to fight in his region's militia eagerly, and for the past seven-odd years, it had been the only life he had ever known, and the men he'd served with were the only family he had. Brighthat thought that it had meant something, that you'd carry out your mission to the best of your ability, but when it came down to it, it was the men around him who'd mattered most. He was fighting for mankind, not just the whole, but every man, woman, and child that made it up. One of the men supporting him had tripped over a stretch of twisted rebar, dropping him hard to the ruined floor. He had known they hadn't much time before the Martians were on them. ""Go on without me,"" he said, almost half-smiling. Whatever interpretation of a grin that had found it's place on his face was dashed away when the man who'd dropped him scurried to his feet, looked him in the eye, nodded, and carried on running. Thinking back, Brighthat thought, that was the moment that I died. ",1,ThreeArmSally,True,t3_2aobux,0,cixdgnh,0,1434714013,

I started collecting starters to help out my local store at the time. They had some starters for some games that had died out and were going to toss out. I offered to buy them so they wouldn't be at a loss for them. Having bought them, there was no real reason not to open them up and try playing with them. I did demos because 1) It gave me a use for those decks, 2) Not every game I did demos on was dead, some were pretty active, so I helped get new players and hopefully some sales for the store, and 3) Because even when the games were dead, most of them were actually still pretty fun to play and it was nice to have something different to do at times. Mostly though, it was just fun. I mostly just ran events, never really played in them and wasn't too huge into collecting for any one specific game. This gave me something unique and different to play.

So to get into the rest of your question, I'll try and break things down a little bit. By all means please let me know if I confuse you on any of this. 

&gt;But 1 (Why are there so many games?) is interesting as well, or a little expanded why are people still buying them. I mean brony obsession set aside, it amazes me that these sell again and again, (going to tackle the rest later)

One of the difficulties I think people have understanding this is that they bias themselves based on the games subject. One example I can think of in my experiences is this. Bandai put out a TCG for Naruto which totally blew up in popularity. I knew several people that refused to play it simply because they hated Naruto. A while late Bandai puts out a TCG for Dragon Ball Z which those people absolutely loved. What I finally pointed out later on to them is that the DBZ game was literally just a rebranded version of the Naruto TCG. Same rules, same gameplay, everything. In fact they were originally designing it so Naruto and DBZ players could play each other. Despite this they still wouldn't touch Naruto and felt it was inferior. I guess the tl:dr I'm getting at hear is that brand is a huge driving force in the success/failure of a game. MLP:FIM is such a huge series at this point, I'd almost be surprised if they didn't have some sort of TCG.

Most people are willing to try anything once if it's related to series they enjoy, not to mention, starters usually are not that expensive to start compared to other hobbies. With tax most games you could get 2 starter decks for ~$20 and boosters ~$5, that really isn't too bad. Video Games are hundreds for the system and ~$50 - $60 a game. Board games can get pricey as hell. Many non-family board games easily start at $60+, I've seen ones starting over $100. Warhammer 40k/Mini's in General can be hundreds of dollars to start. Sports can be all over the place pricewise.  For another point of view, a new video game might cost me $60, I could probably get 2 starters, 4 boosters, 2 packs of sleeves or 2 more boosters, and maybe some dice/counters if they're not included in the starters. Not only do I have everything to learn how to play, but I got some boosters to change things around a little. If I like the game, it's easy to justify to myself buying a few $5 boosters, if I don't like it, I didn't really risk any more money then I might have buying a new game I thought I was like. Low barrier of entry makes a big difference too for these games. Combine that with a company that releases new sets on a regular schedule and it really shouldn't be too hard to see how people get into any game, let alone an already expensive series like MLP:FIM. It can get even cheaper if you got a good playerbase. Often times more established/longer playing players are willing to either give away stuff they don't need to new players or make some pretty lopsided trades to help them get going, so with a bit of luck you can get a good collection without trying too hard.

&gt;I understand that there are some minor differences but shouldn't there be a dominant game for each difference.

&gt;Keep in mind that I'm making these examples up and have no idea what I'm talking about but for example Person A wants quick and simple games so he goes with Pokemon. Person B wants a huge pool of cards and to possibility of spending a fuckton so he goes with Magic the Gathering. Person C wants in depth strategies and what not so he goes with a game that gives him that. Now in order to play a multiplayer game you need other gamers, so it would make sense that the other games that cater to the same audience have a decreasing pool of gamers because one game dominates this specific sub genre.

Right, so you hit on a pretty big issue with TCG games. The thing I would argue though, is that most games are not that cut and dry. Person A - Most games have enough variety with their decks that if you want a simple deck, or a complex deck you could absolutely do both. Granted, at a competitive level you will see variety start to diminish, but at a casual level you can really play what you want. Person B - This is mostly hard with games that are just starting out, but gets easier as time goes on. Most games I've seen are usually around ~100-120 different cards in 1 set, adding new sets every 3-4 months. That's a couple hundred new cards a year. That's just set cards and doesn't include promo cards, or something starters/special boxes will have unique cards. All and all, this is pretty easy, even more so if you're going to weekly tournaments and trading and maybe buying a booster or 2, never mind the people that buy boxes on a regular basis. Person C - This really is comes down to the company making the game and their play testers. The larger games this isn't even a question, if they didn't have depth and strategy they wouldn't likely still be around because people would get bored, fast. Sadly, I've seen many games die because despite having hundreds of cards available, there's really or 1 or 2 decks anyone plays because they're overpowered. Overall though, it's basically the same answer as Person A, they can make the game more complex depending on what they choose to play.

The tl:dr of this section is, while certain games are more focused towards some of those aspects, most of the major games are flexible enough that you can really make them into whatever you're looking for. As such, there's no such a clear-cut ""this game is ""X"" type of game"" in my opinion.

&gt;And now Game company X releases a new card collection game that is quick and simple, why would Person A buy that when we can expect that it is just a fad and he already invested a few 100 dollars in Pokemon.

Variety of reasons in my experience. Like I said before, brand is huge. Imagine if the MLP:FIM TCG was instead, ""Happy School Kids"".  Who is going to want to play that, even if it is a really good game? Probably no one. Just the brand alone will get people to play. I've never played it, even after watching videos I'm still a bit confused by it, but if the game has as much depth as people are saying, then to those people that's why they're playing. Either they couldn't care less about MLP and play because it's fun, or it being MLP is basically just a bonus for them. There could be other reasons. Sometimes there are problems with their main game. Sometimes a set comes out that really sucks and/or ruins the metagame. Someone that's irritated is usually pretty open towards trying other games. Sometimes it's the opposite, players get tired of playing the same decks over and over again, especially in tournaments where net-decking is sadly become more and more common. Another reason, if the two games are fairly similar, that greatly lowers the learning curve for a new player. Being able to get into a new game fast and easy can be a big seller. Sometimes people feel like they've out grown certain games. Maybe someone loves playing Pokemon, but now they're an adult and decide to move onto something similar but more adult themed. Also remember, a new game that comes out there's no reason to assume it will just be a fad. If anything, the early players investing in the game are critical to it's future and make or break new games.

Anyway, that came out way too long. I could probably keep going and get into some specifics, but I think you get the idea. If there's something that doesn't make sense, let me know and I'll try to explain better.",3,FarplaneDragon,True,t3_2amyzv,0,cixd3ev,0,1434713846,

&gt;Hey guys,

&gt;Just wanted to post some very quick early sketches we've done for an alternative loot beam.

&gt;We can't choose, so let us know which one you like best!! 

&gt;'Do all of them' isn't useful :p - if only we had time!

&gt;[Lootbeam Concepts](http://i.imgur.com/vFCTepA.png)

**- Update 27/06/2014**

&gt;The Ninja team are now full speed ahead with Boss Slayer!!!

&gt;For those paying attention, the two polls we had up last week are now closed. Results have determined that Death will be the representing NPC and the title unlock for killing all the bosses incorporated in Boss Slayer will be ""_ the Reaper""; which is nice as the two go quite well together.

&gt;Ana put some quick concepts for a new lootbeam (see above) on the forums, twitter, and reddit. We've kept an eye on what people have said, and it would appear a majority thought that the rainbow was the best. As such, this will be an unlockable reward through Boss Slayer.

&gt;Labl has started work on Death's office, the place you'll be going to receive your daily Boss Slayer task. Below is an early work in progress model of the area:

&gt;[Death's Office](http://i.imgur.com/w3WFNGo.png)

&gt;*(everything is still greybox so it is subject to change)*

&gt;Asherz has been working on a new interface which will display all the bosses available in Boss Slayer with total kills, fastest kill, available drops, as well as some other information. You'll also be able to see a variety of other monster kill counts on the interface as well.

&gt;That's all for this week... You stay classy Gielinor!

**- Update 04/07/2014**

&gt;This week we've made a bit of a change to the face of the project. Now that Death has been voted in as the representing NPC, we decided to theme it a bit more around him and not so much existing Slayer.

&gt;Don’t worry, this won't change anything that we currently have planned, it just means instead of being **assigned** something, you're told to **reap** them instead. The implication being that you collect the souls of the monsters you kill for Death. This is something we're pretty excited about, it made sense to make the change, giving the content much more depth and context in game.

&gt;We mentioned before that we were going to be putting out a pre-release for this project which consisted of boss and monster kill tracking, as well as instanced boss kill timers. Asherz has been working away at getting this sorted as quick as he can so it can be put into game ASAP. This will give you a nice little head start at killing bosses, not only for practice but also towards some of the unlockable rewards going out with the main release a few weeks later.

&gt;Labl is still working away at the 3D environment for Death's office, and it's starting to look hawt! What do you think of this work in progress?

&gt;[Death's Office](http://i.imgur.com/JV3IuSd.png)

&gt;*(currently using Death's old model as a placeholder - also, Roddeck army not included)*

&gt;Ana has been putting some concepts together for one of the rewards that we haven't mentioned yet. I think we'll keep this one up our sleeves for a little while longer as it's pretty darn juicy. 

&gt;Stu O has managed to get his claws on a new Kalphite Queen model which he’s now bringing to life with some fresh animations. We’ll be adding this to our main release as a nice little booster. Again, let us know you think.

&gt;[New Kalphite Queen Model](http://imgur.com/a/ZrY19)

&gt;Finally, we've seen a few people asking for an ETA for this update. We're currently looking to have the pre-release ready to go out towards the end of this month and the actual release should be around the middle of August. This can obviously change but they're our expected release times for those that wanted to know. Quite annoying having to wait but it should definitely be worth it. 


**- Update 14/07/2014**

&gt;The team have been continuing with what was mentioned in the last update; Stu O animating the Kalphite Queen, Labl on the 3D environment for Death's Office, leaving Ana and Asherz on the content side of the pre-release.

&gt;As previously mentioned the pre-release should be with you in the next few weeks; here is what we'll be putting out:

&gt;* **Boss Timers** - these are basically stopwatches which you can view during boss fights. They will only appear in instanced fights with a set group size selected, depending on the boss. When the main release comes out you will be able to view your personal best times for each boss.
* **Boss Kill Tracking** - this will track your boss kills in the background, but you won't be able to see how many until the main release comes out.
* **Slayer Monster Tracking** - the same as boss kill tracking but for a select group of slayer creatures that we were able to fit into the update. More creatures may be able to be tracked later, see our current list in the picture below.

&gt;For the Completionists out there, and those aiming for it, here are the new requirements that we're looking to add with the main updates release:

&gt;* **Completionist** - Kill all bosses to unlock ""_ the Reaper"" title, which will be lost whenever a new boss comes out. All the current bosses are bullet-pointed in the update made on 19/06/2014 on the first post of this thread.
* **Trimmed Completionist** - Unlock all permanent rewards through Boss Slayer. This is a time trial more than anything else, I guess depending on how good you are at bossing will determine how quickly you'll be able to complete this requirement.

&gt;*Note: as kills are tracked with the pre-release, players can work towards the Completionist unlock from that update. Bosses killed before this update will not count towards the achievement. However, we do have existing achievements in-game which will allow us to give players one kill on certain bosses (Barrows &amp; Rots, Fight Caves, Fight Kiln, all GWD, QBD and Vorago including Hardmode) when the pre-release goes live.* 

&gt;Finally, we know you like looking at a few pictures so here are some more sneak peeks from the main release:

1.) WildStar plays a lot like a Jak and Daxter or Ratchet and Clank console game, if you've ever played those. The telegraph system adds an element to the standard MMO combat that changes the feeling to a much more action packed one. Movement is definitely  necessary in WildStar, platforming less so, but it's there.

2.) I think so. But I guess it depends on what you're looking for. The questing in this game isn't exactly revolutionary, but I found them enjoyable enough. The game becomes a LOT more fun with other people, so try to find a social guild to join and group up! Also, they will be constantly updating the game every month with major content patches to justify their subscription fee.

3.) The questing is nothing we haven't seen. What makes the game fun is how reactive combat feels. Stunning an enemy while they're performing a special ability causes them to fall into a ""Moment of Opportunity"" state. During this short window of time, you deal a lot more damage with all your attacks to them. So, while leveling, it always pays off to have some form of CC on your bar to interrupt enemies during their special abilities, because it provides a massive DPS boost. Think of it like a Zelda boss; you gotta expose them!

4.) Crafting isn't too different from what we're used to. You collect materials, you buy some of them from a vendor, and you make stuff. What WildStar does that's really neat, is that it allows you to choose what stats you place on your items you create. I enjoy the process personally.

5.) Open World PvP won't ever be truly balanced as long as people travel in packs ganking solo'ers. However, most my encounters with world pvp on Evindra (an PvE-RP server) has been fun.

6.) The problem with group finder is that the dungeons demand so much organization right now, and 5 random people just don't normally have what it takes to succeed. To enjoy the game's group content best, find a guild of like-minded individuals who are okay with voice communication to tackle the content. That being said, the dungeons and adventures are easily some of the most fun group-content-wise I've had in an MMO to date.

Hope this helped! Looking forward to seeing you in Nexus!",2,Amiron,True,t3_2ane7p,0,cix1m5u,0,1434708404,

And whether the kids are targeted or not, the fact remains that Israel has the blood of 30 children on its hands for its actions during the last week or so. While I agree that Israel has the right to defend itself, its actions have thus far been disproportionate and caused more damage to innocent bystanders than Hamas militants. 

Which only really serves to perpetuate the feeling among Palestinians that the Israelis are the oppressors and invaders. So what's Israel's goal here? They wont do any lasting damage to Hamas' desire to launch rockets into Israeli territory; if anything it will intensify in both the long and short term. Wanton destruction of civilian livelihood only serves to boost the popularity of Hamas; terrorists or not, the only group prepared to stand up for the Palestinians (in their eyes at least, but in reality as well to be honest). Israel can adequately defend itself against pot shots from Hamas, this isn't about any long term security strategy and is nothing but harmful to the idea that the two states can coexist. It's about retribution, collective punishment and political point scoring for the more hard-line Israeli citizens. 

And that is why 30 children had to die. The whole conflict is a clusterfuck, and I doubt it will be over in my lifetime. ",1,FezojT,True,t3_2aka9u,0,ciww2fg,0,1434705695,

He was a decorated war hero. An expert strategist. Without him, this entire war was fucked. We were coming back from talking to troops, boosting morale.

Our helicopter was flying over a neutral area, and a few hostiles must have identified it as an unfriendly aircraft. I don't remember much from the initial descent, but I remember, before we started spiraling out of control, grabbing a chute and taking a good hold of John. Once the tailspin started, I bailed out the side, taking John with me.

As we were free falling, I yelled at John to wrap himself around me as tightly as he could. Once he felt secure, I pulled the strap and wrapped my arms tightly around his back. A few seconds after the chute was deployed, there was a loud ***boom*** in the distance.

As we were still falling, I figured that the chopper was heading West, and that the closer I was to the chopper, the farther I was from the hostiles. I glanced around, trying to find the smoke from the crash in the distance. Once I had pointed it out, I steered our parachute towards it. We were falling for another few minutes. The thing that surprised me was that they didn't even *try* to shoot at our parachute. Maybe they were low on rounds, and wanted a better chance at hitting us.

We were nearing the ground below us, and I was steering us relatively close to a rock, so we could take cover pretty much immediately. We were starting to near the ground. ""Brace yourself. When we land, I want you to run to the rock that will be to the left of us, okay?"" I yelled. I tried to slow down as much as possible, before kicking my feet up and flying parallel to the dirt beneath us. The rock was around 30 feet to our left. I aimed for a relatively large shrub and pressed my detach button on my parachute, slowing us down semi-slowly, but very painfully.

Upon landing, I briefly asked John, ""Are you okay?""

""I'll be fine, let's just get to that rock quickly!"" he responded. He already started dashing over there, while I was jogging right behind him.

""Fuck, okay, we need to think, what should we do?""

""They didn't fire at us while we were in the air, they may be terrible shots.""

""Wait, do you think they have a sniper rifle?""

""Fuck, I don't know. They had a stinger or some type of AA gun though, so chances are, these guys are pretty heavily armed. We need to watch ourselves.""

""Hold on, I'll take off my helmet and raise it a bit with something nearby. Let's see if they buy it."" I began to take off my helmet and handed it to him. ""I need to notify command! Go ahead and get this started, try to find something close by!""

""I'm on it.""

""Command, this is Echo Seven. Our chopper was hit. I have Secretary Haggerty with me, we're both fine. We're not sure about the rest of the crew, over,"" I slurred into my coms piece.

""Roger that, are there any hostiles nearby?"" they asked.

""We're not sure. We were hit by an anti-air missile maybe a klick East of our position. Over.""

""Copy. We have your location on radar. A transport chopper is en route. E.T.A. 4 minutes, over.""

""Negative, that's not good enough, you'll need some firepower! These guys must be heavily armed!""

""Transport chopper will have a M134 minigun on it.""

""Copy that. That should be good. Out.""

I glanced back over at John, and he had a few nearby sticks collected from a close shrub. He lifted it up a little bit, just peaking over the rock. We heard the impact of a bullet ricochet off of the rock, followed by the crack of their sniper.

""Fuck! Do you have any firearms, soldier?"" John said.

""I have my M9 with a spare mag, but that's it!""

""It'll have to do. They're probably moving up as we speak. If we wait long enough, we might be able to have a decent shot.""

""Fuck, fuck, fuck! Do you have anything with a reflection on it?!""

""Yeah, my sunglasses managed to survive the fall.""

I snagged his glasses from him and popped out one lens. I tried to move it out a bit and catch a decent angle, maybe catch them moving up. I saw some movement on the lens, but not nearly close enough.

""The chopper is coming, I see it on the horizon,"" John said.

""We have to make sure they're distracted as it gets close. Listen, I'm going to charge the enemies with my pistol, and you stay here. I'll unload one clip here, and I'll rush at them shooting when the chopper is closer.""

""What, are you fucking nuts?!?! We can both easily get out of this alive!""

""You're more valuable to our victory than I am, and we need to make sure that you get out of here. The helicopter could get shot down if I don't.""

I grabbed my helmet, strapped it on, and peaked out of the rock. I saw a head pop up in the distance, and I pulled out my pistol, aimed high in the air, and fired a few rounds, hoping it would scare them into cover. It worked for a minute, before bullets started flying in our direction.

""You'll be fine, just stay here. The helicopter is going to be here in 90 seconds. It has an M134, you need to make it!""

""You're fucking coming with me!""

The bullets were more scarce now, so I poked my head out and fired 7 rounds, hid for a second, and fired 5 more rounds. I pulled out my empty clip, handed it to John, and grabbed a fresh one.

""No I'm not."" The bullets started coming in again.

""What's your name, soldier?""

""I'm Corporal Thomas.""

I bursted out from the rock, and started firing multiple rounds in the other direction. The enemies were much closer than earlier, but so was the chopper. One poked out from the rock with what looked like an AK 74. I shot three rounds in his direction. One hit him in the arm and he ducked back behind the rock. Another popped out with an AK 74 as well, and I shot at him twice. Both missed, but he ducked back in cover anyways. I started sprinting at them, and three of them must have risen at the same time. They started spraying at me. I immediately hit the deck and started firing back. I hit another one in his arm, but I was done for. I had three bullets in my back, one in my leg, and one on each  arm. They ducked back in cover temporarily, and when they popped back out, I shot three times as quickly as I could, and my gun was empty.

All I could hear as I laid dying on the desert ground was the sound of an M134 blazing through rounds. I coughed up some blood as everything started fading to white. My breath was shaking, and I suddenly felt cold. I heard the rounds stop. I laid my head back in the dirt as everything seemed to fade away.",2,EverythingsConnected,True,t3_2am06p,0,ciwuz8a,0,1434705197,
0,,t1_ciwrofg,10,1405309878,,t1_ciwjoef,False,nba,False,,t5_2qo4s,"The Chicago Bulls just never seem to get their man. That's a strange observation to make about a franchise with six NBA titles, but it's true when it comes to the history of Chicago's free agent pursuits. It's been that way since Michael Jordan left the team in 1998, and continued Saturday when Carmelo Anthony pledged to return to the New York Knicks.

In Chicago at least, nice guys finish second, and they end up with players like Pau Gasol. The problem with Chicago's recurring Plan B is that while it keeps the Bulls relevant, they remain on the perimeter of the title chase, rather than in the middle of it. To get off that second-tier, the Bulls needed a bold move. If Anthony had chosen the Bulls, that would have certainly qualified. But by rushing into the Gasol acquisition, they leave themselves in the same spot they've been too many times: an also-ran.

Don't misunderstand -- Gasol has a lot to offer. He's a skilled offensive player, though at 34, he's not the go-to scorer he used to be. His defense, once excellent, was laughably bad at times for the Lakers. His metrics weren't horrible, and when I watched video of Gasol on defense last year, it was unclear to me whether the issue was Gasol's declining athleticism, or Mike D'Antoni's cavalier approach at coaching defense. Whatever it was, Gasol often looked like he was skating backward when covering the pick-and-roll.

With the Bulls, though, perhaps his length and the cast around him will be enough to keep him adequate. Still, Gasol is a Hall of Famer, and one of the most well-liked players in the game. While Gasol could have been a key pickup for a number of contenders around the league, Gasol doesn't fit with Chicago.
Defensive duos
Frontcourt Tandem 	4Q Min. 	Def. Rating
Taj Gibson-Joakim Noah 	752 	101.3
Joakim Noah-Carlos Boozer 	76 	101.5
Taj Gibson-Carlos Boozer 	56 	112.2
Pau Gasol (with Lakers) 	344 	117.9

Joakim Noah and Taj Gibson are a great defensive tandem, and that's why Carlos Boozer watched most fourth quarters from the sidelines the past season. It's also why Gasol is unlikely to see big crunch-time minutes, as Tom Thibodeau sticks with his prized defensive unit. Chicago's offense often bogged down in the clutch, but it's going to be hard for Gasol to remedy that from the sideline.

Gasol isn't breaking the bank. While we don't know yet exact terms of his deal, it reportedly is a straight free-agent signing, as the Bulls and Lakers were unable to come to an accord on a sign-and-trade arrangement. That means Boozer is gone, either via a trade to a team willing to soak up his expiring contract, or via the amnesty provision of the CBA, which must be used by Wednesday.

By my calculations, the Bulls likely must renounce free agents Kirk Hinrich and D.J. Augustin, among others, while clearing some non-guaranteed contracts from the books. All of this opened about $10 to 11 million in cap space for the Bulls. That money will likely be divided between Gasol and European prospect Nikola Mirotic.

Now the Bulls have one of the deepest frontcourts in the league. Noah, Gibson, Gasol and Mirotic will give Thibodeau plenty of options at the big-man spots. The Bulls are better, and deeper, up front than last season. If Derrick Rose returns to health and form, Chicago will be among the top contenders in the East, along with division foes Cleveland and Indiana.

The biggest problem with the acquisition is that the opportunity cost is greater than the upgrade from Boozer to Gasol. Both players are in decline. Gasol's rolling three-year average in WARP has gone from 38.4 to 28.9 to 18.0 since he last played for Phil Jackson in Los Angeles. A modest projection for his 2014-15 total is 5.2 WARP, giving his age (34) and recent performance.
Pau Gasol
Mike DiNovo/USA TODAY SportsNoah and Gasol will offer the Bulls more scoring options in the paint.

Boozer was below replacement level last season, but given similar minutes to Gasol, a presumed bounce-back season and his age, his rough projection is 3.2 WARP. So Chicago's chief free-agent acquisition of the summer will be around a two-win upgrade. But even that's not the problem. Had Chicago just kept Boozer on the books, their baseline projection, which I now have in the range of 53 to 55 wins, would not have been significantly altered.

The biggest hope for a boost remains a comeback campaign for Rose, as well has continued development by Jimmy Butler, Tony Snell and a hoped-for boost from first-round pick Doug McDermott. The Gasol signing in and of itself doesn't move the needle much either way. If Chicago had held on to Boozer, then his $16.9 million expiring contract would have become a chief resource to nab any disgruntled star who might shake loose in the trade market between now and February's deadline. While teams might not be clamoring to take on Boozer's deal now, as the season his expiration date might have softened that collective stance.
More moves?

Obviously Kevin Love would have been a great trade target, but now there is a glut in the frontcourt, and Gasol didn't sign with Chicago in order to be flipped to Minnesota. Other stars could come available and even if they don't, Boozer's contract would expire after the season, preserving some flexibility for attempt at a splash next summer.

What's next? I'd expect Mirotic to sign soon, and my guess is at that point, the Bulls' cap space will be gone. Chicago will have the room exception of $2.077 million to spend, and the Bulls need a starting wing. Trevor Ariza is off the market, signing a four-year, $32 million deal with Houston on Saturday. Former Bull Luol Deng won't take that exception.

One player who might is Caron Butler, a respected veteran who Thibodeau would like, though he projects as about replacement level at this point in his career. If Hinrich is willing to return for the veteran's minimum, the Bulls would surely love to have him. One reclamation project on the market who could fit Chicago's need for an instant offense threat is Rodney Stuckey, who is in need of a little of the career rehab that Thibodeau can provide.

Chicago will be a deep team in the coming season -- one of the deepest in the league. With health, the Bulls will win over 50 games. Depending on just how quickly things come together for the Cavaliers, the Bulls could well be in the running for the top seed in the East, which they landed in both 2011 and 2012. But this default to Plan B simply consigns Chicago to good-but-not-great status.

You can argue that we might label the Spurs' team that just buzz-sawed its way to an NBA title as a depth team, and it's a salient point. And with veteran talent and one of the league's best coaches, Chicago will be relevant. But barring an unforeseen splash, you can't help but wonder if Chicago has blocked its own path to greatness.

The phenomenon known as *pranking* has been observed in evidence as early as the first human settlements and has become a major, almost impenetrably staple, section of human bonding and relationship. First described in detail late in the 14th Century experts believe the initial exposure of the world to *pranking* begun a new and impossibly infectious means of social interaction. 

Pranks are usually undertaken by close members members of a societal group and often for humorous reasons. Prankers will collaborate their ingenuity to fool a predetermined prankee, who will be oblivious to all planning activity until the prank is played to its fullest extent. There is no real data on the success rate of pranks but it is colloquially known that many pranks have a chance to encounter a short boost in effectiveness when in the process of being carried out. Novel innovations can occur during these chance encounters and enhance the comedic effect of the prank.

Note that some pranks may contribute to grievous physical and emotional retaliation and harm. No figures are currently available on the frequency and severity of these harms.

**METHODS** 

While many pranks may be elaborate, this prank will require no more than a male human and a good, long day of hard work. The male human will be required to undergo a long day of hard work before the prank can be initiated.

1. The prankee will be appropriately chosen. This may be predetermined hours or even a few minutes before the prank begins. The prankee may be emotionally crippled, the source of some annoyance throughout the daily activities to which revenge must be exacted or simply non-immune to prank-related activities.

2. The male human initiating the prank must signal to other humans in the vicinity that the prank is to be initiated at that time. Note: THE PRANKEE SHOULD NOT BE AWARE OF THIS INTERACTION. Possible vectors for communication may include winking, nodding, smiling, texting, Facebooking and mutual masturbation.

3. Upon agreement and understanding that the prank is to be initated, all those involved will be silent and allow the male human (pranker) to begin.

4. The male human (pranker) will reach into his boxers and rigorously scratch his scrotum. Accepted methods are: 

- The pinch and roll
- The 'under the shaft and onto the sack' rub
- The 'I wonder which one of my balls is lower today' investigation
- A novel method in which all fingers are involved in collectively cupping and uncupping the testes.

Upon collection of an effective amount of sweat onto his fingers, the male human (pranker) will approach the prankee and tell him to smell his fingers.


**RESULTS**

Most prankees will smell the fingers and as such will retract in shame and disgust. Some may puke. Many will lash out in violent disgust.

**DISCUSSION**

It is seen as unsanitary in its workings but this prank has a strong basis in history. Seen very early on this prank is a time-enduring piece. However, problems may arrive when the male human (pranker) has a bad case of smegma (see UrbanDictionary). In this case it would be advisable to choose another human male (pranker) to carry out the prank. Some prankees will inquire as to *why* they should smell the fingers, to which the appropriate response is ""I totally fingerbanged ______'s queefbox and I can still smell it"".",3,ShakespeareGotHigh,True,t3_2amir7,0,ciwnphm,0,1434701626,

Each of the boosts may be used ONCE PER DAY and wielding the banner is not required for the boost.  This chart also shows nothing there is no time graph on it besides days which isn't very helpful considering we are talking hours.  If anything this graph shows that it took you several DAYS not HOURS to get 99 herblore.  Might want to consider finding a better graph to look at because you can not use this graph for a hourly argument when its not updated hourly.  Also why would you not count the time it took you to make the extremes to get 94 if you're going to count 92-94 in you're ""it only took me 1 hour to get 99"" statement?  If you're not going to count it then you need to say 94-99.  I could go and buy energy potions and do them for a hour nonstop to show you how many can be done in a hour but I feel like that would be a waste of time because no matter what you won't take the number I give you as truth considering I already gave you the number that I could do in 1 hour that I got from 4 days ago.

If you wanna say there is a lot to do in WoW and you're wanting to look at Runescape from the perspective of someone that has played for 9 years (yourself) then you need to look at WoW that same way (from the prospective of someone who has played for 9 years).  There's a lot to do in Runescape for a new player if you're wanting to look at WoW like its a new game you need to look at Runescape the same way other wise your comparison is flawed.  The elf city has been worked on for 6 months not a year the poll for it came ended January 31th 2014.  How long has it been since WoW updated?  To my knowledge there are 4 patches per expansion one every 4 months and then after the 4th one there is usually a 8 month time frame with no patches at all not to mention the patches hardly add anything.  You only get the big updated when you buy the expansion.  The last patch WoW had was December 10th 2013 and it didn't even add anything to the game.  From what I've been able to dig up Warlords of Draenor is the last expansion that WoW is going to be getting.

I'd say Castro's attempt to grow sugar cane in Cuba is a good example. Castro's goal was to provide a boost to Cuba's economy, but he crippled it instead. I think he had good intentions for the people of Cuba. He failed to diversify their economic output and affected a lot of people poorly. I'd say intelligence is important, but not the only factor in making good decisions.

The Chicago Bulls just never seem to get their man. That's a strange observation to make about a franchise with six NBA titles, but it's true when it comes to the history of Chicago's free agent pursuits. It's been that way since Michael Jordan left the team in 1998, and continued Saturday when Carmelo Anthony pledged to return to the New York Knicks.

In Chicago at least, nice guys finish second, and they end up with players like Pau Gasol. The problem with Chicago's recurring Plan B is that while it keeps the Bulls relevant, they remain on the perimeter of the title chase, rather than in the middle of it. To get off that second-tier, the Bulls needed a bold move. If Anthony had chosen the Bulls, that would have certainly qualified. But by rushing into the Gasol acquisition, they leave themselves in the same spot they've been too many times: an also-ran.

Don't misunderstand -- Gasol has a lot to offer. He's a skilled offensive player, though at 34, he's not the go-to scorer he used to be. His defense, once excellent, was laughably bad at times for the Lakers. His metrics weren't horrible, and when I watched video of Gasol on defense last year, it was unclear to me whether the issue was Gasol's declining athleticism, or Mike D'Antoni's cavalier approach at coaching defense. Whatever it was, Gasol often looked like he was skating backward when covering the pick-and-roll.

With the Bulls, though, perhaps his length and the cast around him will be enough to keep him adequate. Still, Gasol is a Hall of Famer, and one of the most well-liked players in the game. While Gasol could have been a key pickup for a number of contenders around the league, Gasol doesn't fit with Chicago.

Defensive duos
FRONTCOURT TANDEM	4Q MIN.	DEF. RATING
Taj Gibson-Joakim Noah	752	101.3
Joakim Noah-Carlos Boozer	76	101.5
Taj Gibson-Carlos Boozer	56	112.2
Pau Gasol (with Lakers)	344	117.9
Joakim Noah and Taj Gibson are a great defensive tandem, and that's why Carlos Boozer watched most fourth quarters from the sidelines the past season. It's also why Gasol is unlikely to see big crunch-time minutes, as Tom Thibodeau sticks with his prized defensive unit. Chicago's offense often bogged down in the clutch, but it's going to be hard for Gasol to remedy that from the sideline.

Gasol isn't breaking the bank. While we don't know yet exact terms of his deal, it reportedly is a straight free-agent signing, as the Bulls and Lakers were unable to come to an accord on a sign-and-trade arrangement. That means Boozer is gone, either via a trade to a team willing to soak up his expiring contract, or via the amnesty provision of the CBA, which must be used by Wednesday.

By my calculations, the Bulls likely must renounce free agents Kirk Hinrich and D.J. Augustin, among others, while clearing some non-guaranteed contracts from the books. All of this opened about $10 to 11 million in cap space for the Bulls. That money will likely be divided between Gasol and European prospect Nikola Mirotic.

Now the Bulls have one of the deepest frontcourts in the league. Noah, Gibson, Gasol and Mirotic will give Thibodeau plenty of options at the big-man spots. The Bulls are better, and deeper, up front than last season. If Derrick Rose returns to health and form, Chicago will be among the top contenders in the East, along with division foes Cleveland and Indiana.

The biggest problem with the acquisition is that the opportunity cost is greater than the upgrade from Boozer to Gasol. Both players are in decline. Gasol's rolling three-year average in WARP has gone from 38.4 to 28.9 to 18.0 since he last played for Phil Jackson in Los Angeles. A modest projection for his 2014-15 total is 5.2 WARP, giving his age (34) and recent performance.

Noah and Gasol will offer the Bulls more scoring options in the paint.
Boozer was below replacement level last season, but given similar minutes to Gasol, a presumed bounce-back season and his age, his rough projection is 3.2 WARP. So Chicago's chief free-agent acquisition of the summer will be around a two-win upgrade. But even that's not the problem. Had Chicago just kept Boozer on the books, their baseline projection, which I now have in the range of 53 to 55 wins, would not have been significantly altered.

The biggest hope for a boost remains a comeback campaign for Rose, as well has continued development by Jimmy Butler, Tony Snell and a hoped-for boost from first-round pick Doug McDermott. The Gasol signing in and of itself doesn't move the needle much either way. If Chicago had held on to Boozer, then his $16.9 million expiring contract would have become a chief resource to nab any disgruntled star who might shake loose in the trade market between now and February's deadline. While teams might not be clamoring to take on Boozer's deal now, as the season his expiration date might have softened that collective stance.

More moves?

Obviously Kevin Love would have been a great trade target, but now there is a glut in the frontcourt, and Gasol didn't sign with Chicago in order to be flipped to Minnesota. Other stars could come available and even if they don't, Boozer's contract would expire after the season, preserving some flexibility for attempt at a splash next summer.

What's next? I'd expect Mirotic to sign soon, and my guess is at that point, the Bulls' cap space will be gone. Chicago will have the room exception of $2.077 million to spend, and the Bulls need a starting wing. Trevor Ariza is off the market, signing a four-year, $32 million deal with Houston on Saturday. Former Bull Luol Deng won't take that exception.

One player who might is Caron Butler, a respected veteran who Thibodeau would like, though he projects as about replacement level at this point in his career. If Hinrich is willing to return for the veteran's minimum, the Bulls would surely love to have him. One reclamation project on the market who could fit Chicago's need for an instant offense threat is Rodney Stuckey, who is in need of a little of the career rehab that Thibodeau can provide.

Chicago will be a deep team in the coming season -- one of the deepest in the league. With health, the Bulls will win over 50 games. Depending on just how quickly things come together for the Cavaliers, the Bulls could well be in the running for the top seed in the East, which they landed in both 2011 and 2012. But this default to Plan B simply consigns Chicago to good-but-not-great status.

You can argue that we might label the Spurs' team that just buzz-sawed its way to an NBA title as a depth team, and it's a salient point. And with veteran talent and one of the league's best coaches, Chicago will be relevant. But barring an unforeseen splash, you can't help but wonder if Chicago has blocked its own path to greatness.

That's like saying ""I've never thrown myself off a window and fallen to the ground, for all I know I could fly! Forget what everyone else says'll happen!""

It's ridiculous! To say ""try for yourself"" this untested, potentially harmful drug is the epitome of irresponsibility. Fact is, you can trust what other people who have recorded their data and have had the results reproduced by other people tell you when the data is collected in a good study. What makes a good study? Large sample size (eventually, first you must test for mortality rates with a samller sample and ratchet it up as time goes on, perhaps a few animal studies to ensure participant safety), other factors accounted for (you can't compare cognitive increase between a teenager and an eighty year old person, for example, and expect them to match up), and transparency so that your experiment can be repeated and verified by others.

A single person's judgement is susceptible to biases and simply being wrong. It's natural, everyone is wrong a lot of the time and people can easily be swayed and have their experiences (especially as something as hard to define as ""memory boosting"", if you were to take a test or something before and after treatment on this drug and had some quantifiable improvement I would be less skeptical of your claims) manipulated by hopes and personal investment.

You listen to what other people tell you to do all the time, you don't drink drain cleaner because other people tell you it's poisonous, you don't jump off a building because it will kill or cripple you and you don't buy a timeshare as an investment because people know that it is a scam.

So it works like this: privateers generate 150% of the trade power in a node they're pirating that a light ship would normally generate. They then return 40% of their income to you. Privateer efficiency then acts as another multiplier on top of the base trade power that a privateer has (which is regular 150% regular TP, remember).

Let's say you have 10 light ships which each have 5 TP, for a total value of 50 TP. You send them to privateer in a node, and so right off the bat, they are now generating 150% of their base, so they generate 75 TP in that node. Now, you take your privateering efficiency, and multiply that TP by it to get your new actual TP. So let's say you have 25% privateering efficiency. So 125% of 75 is 93.75, your new total trade power for your privateers in that node. You are now calculating the 40% income they return to you using this number, instead of the 75 TP they had at base.

If you look at those figures, and given that it's typically difficult to raise privateering efficiency a lot, you realize that most of the time, pure trade ships are going to be better for generating more income for you, provided you are smart in nodes where you either collect or can credibly compete at transferring power towards your home node.

The exceptions, however, are when you have a lot of spare light ships to use, and there are nodes where you can't really do anything to steer trade home, which means nodes that are downstream from your collection nodes, or nodes that are just totally outside your trade network. Say you collect in Bordeaux, but those bastards in the Netherlands are collecting in Antwerpen, and they're pulling a lot of your trade towards their node. You send a bunch privateers to Antwerpen to fuck up their trade, make a little money, and make it less attractive to steer trade away from you.

The other aspect of it is deciding if you really want to go balls to the wall in terms of acquiring privateer efficiency. You can get it through certain idea groups and decisions, and some nations have national ideas that enhance it as well, and your naval tradition augments it as well, at a rate of .25 points of privateer efficiency for each point of naval tradition. If you boost your PE up to like 75% or higher, then we're talking about pirate fleets that have crazy high trade power and basically make competing for trade a nightmare in whatever node they're in. It also makes them return more income to you and makes them less of an economic compromise over regular trade than they otherwise might be.

Nothing in the history of their species could quite match up to what was about to happen, even the War that had now raged for well over fifty years could surpass the extraordinary events that they were all witnessing right now. 
A hush fell over the packed bar on the outskirts of the main industrial city of Umm'kal. Outside, the factories themselves had ceased their relentless activity because there was nobody there to operate the machinery. The surrounding streets had never been so empty. Every face in that dingy little bar turned toward the large telescreen and watched, enraptured.
""Hello and welcome to a very special episode of Hard News. My name is Trgut'Spa and with us tonight is our glorious leader Hatr'Dta and the commanding officer of the Combined Forces Foty'jak. Joining us in tonight's discussion we have a guest of such importance and power that is truly a turning point in our species development.""
Trgut'Spa turned to another camera and with an almost religious reverence continued, ""What we are about to do is unprecedented to almost every known species in the known Universe. It brings me the greatest of pleasure to introduce Peter Gillman, the Human Union Council Leader.""
The picture on the telescreen in the bar panned around the faces of their very own leader, then the Commander and finally rested on the Human. There was a collective intake of breath from everyone present, then the mummering started;What did it mean for the war? Where they joining our side? Will they bring us into the Fold?  
The presenter reclaimed the screen. ""Firstly, let me begin with our Leader; Hatr'Dta. THe only question on the lips of every Haja'r right now is this; What does this mean? Can you elaborate for us?""
Hatr'Da took a deep breath through his gills, ""Simply put, yes. The Humans have allied themselves with us. Up until now our contact has only ever been rare and sporadic points of trade. Today, that has all changed. They are willing to put their might behind us to liberate ourselves from the death and destruction that this interminable war has put upon us."" He sat back with just a little sweat gleaming on his brow.
Trgut'Spa pushed the issue. ""That is truly great news. However, what do they want in return?""
The leader was quick to answer, ""Nothing. Nothing at all. I couldn't believe it either, but it is true.""
This answer stunned Trgut'Spa as he had prepared a lengthy rebuttal on any possible demands the Humans wanted in return for their help. Thinking quickly the presenter moved on to the Commander, ""Commander, what does this mean for the War? Are we insight of the end?""
Foty'Jak was cool and calm under pressure, as would be expected of a Haja'r that held the lives of billions in his hand, but he was also conscious of those billions of eyes on him right now. ""The Humans are the most technologically advanced species in the known Universe. Their power, strength and wealth are legendary. However, so is their neutrality. Their isolationism from other species has been the cause of great concern over the millennia, with many commentators suggesting that they are only leaping forward to gain evolved transcendence quicker and leave the rest of us behind. But, I am happy to dispel those concerns and tell every Haja'r that they are here to help us bring the War to swift and decisive conclusion for us. With the Humans as allies we will have victory in longer than one week.""
At that statement the Haja'r in the bar erupted in triumph and relief. Every single one of them had lost loved ones during the War and the knowledge that no more would be lost was the greatest boost to the species morale since they had invented space travel.
The presenter seemed aghast at the prediction and then turned to the Human, ""Mr Peter Gillman, It is a great pleasure to have you with us today. The news that you bring is truly wonderful. Can you give us any detail on how you intend to bring the War to a close?""
Peter smiled warmly and leant forward in the chair that had been specifically designed and built for the Human. Humans were after all a good three feet shorter than any Haja'r, even a fully grown Human. ""Trgut'Spa. Firstly, thank you for the warm welcome your people of shown me and my delegation. Secondly, I cannot divulge any information on the battle plans that my Generals and yours have drawn up. Im sorry. what I can say is that it will take the minimum of our resources to secure your victory."" Peter sat back.
""I understand, sir. Perhaps you can answer some other questions i have?"" Trgut'Spa said a little smugly.
""Please, ask away and i'll do my best to answer them fully."" Peter seemed completely unfazed by the occasion or the look of mistrust in the presenters three eyes.
""Thank you. Well...Here I go then. Why? I mean, why now have you decided to help us? You are not exactly known for your outward looking policies.""
""That's true. After ten thousand years of space travel our neutrality and isolationism has began to make us disinterested and almost callous in the affairs of the species that we share this Universe with. For our own development, that could not be allowed to continue. It was an opinion shared by over 98% of the Human species. So here we are, ready to help and open ourselves up to you."" Peter spoke with the passion of a true politician.
""Well, that is interesting to hear Mr Gillman. But why us? And why now?"" Trgut'Spa was still a little dubious of the Human's motives.
""Obviously, we keep track of many races in the Universe and track their developments and progress. The Haja'r were shown to be the most promising. To see that potential wasted at the hands of an aggressor would be a tragedy. We genuinely want to help anyway we can. And not just in the War. We want to set up strong trade links with, cultural exchanges, pool and share knowledge and work together to the betterment of us all.""
Trgut'Spa seemed to be satisfied for the moment or he was told to be, but either way he introduced their roving reporter.
""Trgut'Spa, I can hear you loud and clear.""
""Can you tell us where you are and what you're doing?""
""I'm here in the Human home system of Sol. I'm currently orbiting the largest gas giant in the system, Jupiter, in the war vessel they are dispatching to the conflict zone. As you can see behind me the crew is made of not just Humans but also the best war pilots and strategists we have. They're working together to ready the ship to leave, which should be in the next two minutes.""
""Did i hear you correctly? One vessel?"" Trgut'Spa smelt blood. He knew there had to be a catch to this new found altruism from the Humans, they didn't want to help they wanted the Haja'r.
""Thats correct. One ship. I'm told that is all it will take to completely neutralize the enemy fleet.""
""But at last count, their fleet was well over ninety thousand war frigates. Is your information accurate?""
""Let me introduce you to the Captain of the Human Union Council Nautilus, Captain Smith."" The reporter turned his head lumberingly toward the captain, ""Captain, no doubt you heard the question posed. Tell us, will this one ship suffice?""
""Let me assure you and all of the Haja'r species, this vessel will prevail. We have produced this new class of vessel especially to deal with the  problem you have. I cannot give details on it's specification as yet, but trust me when i say, you will win now. Im sorry but i must get back to my post.""
The captain marched off and began conferring with a Haja'r. 
""So there you have it In a little over a week we will have reclaimed our planets and made a powerful ally...One Minute...What's happening?..We are about to depart. The vessel is moving...No its not...It feels like it its...The hull is transparent...OH MY GODS!!! We're in the War now....The enemy ships are exploding all over space...Theres thousands of them...We're at their homeworld...I've never seen anything like it...We have incoming...Incoming from everywhere...""
The picture was lost. The Haja'r in the stinking bar stared at the video screen in stunned silence. What the hell was going on?

&gt; Once the increases and decreases in income for all workers are taken into account, overall real income would rise by $2 billion.

&gt;Real income would increase, on net, by $5 billion for families whose income will be below the poverty threshold under current law, boosting their average family income by about 3 percent and moving about 900,000 people, on net, above the poverty threshold (out of the roughly 45 million people who are projected to be below that threshold under current law).

&gt;Families whose income would have been between one and three times the poverty threshold would receive, on net, $12 billion in additional real income. About $2 billion, on net, would go to families whose income would have been between three and six times the poverty threshold.

&gt;Real income would decrease, on net, by $17 billion for families whose income would otherwise have been six times the poverty threshold or more, lowering their average family income by 0.4 percent.

This is an exciting time. Like a rocket with a favorable trajectory, the energy (and the server traffic) rises every day. We’re so close to a moment we’ve been dreaming about for years – some of us more years than others.




Let’s recount the countdown: We celebrated yet another Bungie Day. We revealed some collectibles for the Guardian that lurks deep within you, waiting to be released. We opened a window into the Destiny Beta, and started to illuminate the last mile between you and the beginning of your adventure. And the party didn’t stop there.







Those retail codes you’ve been clutching in your hot little hands have a purpose now! The next step between you and the download of the Destiny Beta is to redeem your codes and then choose a console. Have you done that? Now’s the time to sign up and be counted.




This is the main event before we unleash this game on the world. We need your help to prepare the frontier for the invasion scheduled for September 9th. You have a chance to be there before we light this candle. You’ll be able to tell people who become Guardians forever more that you were there when we were boosting for orbit. 









**Help is on the Way.**




The Destiny Beta is a test. Make no mistake. This isn’t some circus stunt. This is science – and you’re the lab rat. Just moments ago at a Bungie team meeting, Executive Producer Patrick O’Kelley mentioned the work being done to incorporate the learnings from the Destiny Alpha. Whenever someone touches our game, it makes a difference.




We’d love to tell you that everything will go according to plan, but that wouldn’t be any fun. That wouldn’t teach us a thing. Even if the Beta is working perfectly, one of the alpha-geeks in the operations center is gonna kick it to see if it still works. Fortunately, we’ll be going to great lengths to keep you informed and keep you in the game.




When the games begin, Bungie.net will get a serious facelift. We’ll be infusing your volatile homeland in cyberspace with some new services that will let you shine a nova-hot spotlight on just how badass you’ll become. The next evolution for Bungie.net is also about support. Or should we say help?


**Help.Bungie.net**



Take note of that URL. Write it down. Bookmark it in advance. If you ever have trouble acquiring orbit over the worlds of Destiny, make that your first stop. We just might have already answered your question. I’d love to tell you we’ve thought of everything, but we wouldn’t be having a Beta if that were true.




Another early warning system is @BungieHelp on Twitter. We’ll be chirping updates on the status of the test from moment to moment. We’ll also monitor the Twitterverse for signs of trouble.




If all else fails, and you really need to talk to someone, allow us to introduce you to the Mentors on Bungie.net. They rule the #Support forum in these parts with an iron fist in a white glove. When it comes to questions that separate the people in our community from a good experience, we rely on the heart of a volunteer instead of an 800 number and a script.




Sound good? Then, we’ll see you in the Tower.









“First!”




This is the part of the weekly update where you ask: “Do we get any new information about the game?”




And then we say “What? It was Bungie Day this week. You got a trailer and some sweet loot to collect!”




And then you say “That was days ago.”




Instead of crumpling into a defeated heap, we’re calling in reinforcements from our friends at IGN.

Just like the Beta, this coverage will become more elaborate the more time you spend with it.









When you’re marshaling thousands of gamers to the front line of a theoretical battle, you don’t have to ask questions. They find you. Instead of a proper Mail Sack, we’ve channeled the loudest and most frequent voices from the community this week. Let’s open… this.







**Will you release more Ghost editions?**



No promises. We wanted to release limited editions that were actually limited. When you play the game, you’ll appreciate the appearance of exotic loot because not everyone will have it. The same goes for the editions of Destiny that have been designed for collectors. If you can find one, collect it.




**I have a PS4, and I’m in Australia. Which region do I pick?**




Sorry for the confusion on that one! You now have two options on our console selection menu. They are ""Americas"" and ""Global."" Sorry for the initial confusion. If you are not in North American, choose ""Global.""




**I have a PS4, and I live in Europe. When I go to select my console, I’m being told that codes are not available. What gives?**



We should have codes any day now. As soon as we have what you need, we’ll post an update wherever you’re paying attention to us.




**We get three codes?**



You get three codes. When your wave for the Beta begins, we’ll be equipping you with a Fireteam. Share those codes with your friends. Approach people on the street, and invite them to become legend. Spend some quality time catching up with your Mom in Old Russia.




**What if I want to play on more than one console?**




You will need more than one Beta code. These are bound to one account on one box. You’ll be able to create (how do we say this) more than one Guardian on that account, but you’ll need to pre-order separately for Beta, just as you would for the final version of the game.




**Why do you hate your Xbox fans?**




We don't hate any of our fans. When we look at Bungie.net, we see gamers. We dare say that we see Bungie fans – although that might be assuming too much. Loving a good game and the hard-working developers who create it is not a console exclusive. This is one place where Guardians will truly be equal. You’ll each have a chance to become legend on this site. Our hope is that we can use this environment to talk about the amazing experiences we will all have in common. Bungie has embraced many different platforms in our storied history. We have a hard time sitting still. Our goal has been to create amazing worlds and fill them with as many passionate people as possible. What we would tell you is that, if you want to explore the world of Destiny, it was built with you in mind. We make games here at Bungie. We love the people who play them equally.




That’s all the news that’s fit to blog this week. If you listen carefully, you can hear another Beta code being redeemed. Did it belong to someone you know? Are you ready yourself?




We hope we see you soon, and to enjoy the light of the Traveler as it falls on the face you’ve chosen for yourself.""",11,FraserBaws,True,t3_2ah93i,0,civ2xpz,0,1434673864,

&gt;Senna, The Apparition

&gt;So, this is my concept for Senna post-lantern. She doesn’t have her gun, her body and mind have been shattered by her experiences torn between life and death, and her whole existence has been imbued with Void magic. I decided to go with a support build for her, mostly because I wanted to channel as much Thresh as Lucian, and because it creates the opportunity for a Lucian/Senna bot lane combo. I’ve included a bunch of Thresh-specific hate in the “hidden” passives, because it should be much harder for Thresh to lane against someone so keyed to his biz. Also, I realize I’m super late to the commenting game, and this will probably get buried. I’m cool with that. 

&gt;Passive – Senna, her body shattered by her experiences in the Lantern, does not gain health or mana per level. Instead, she collects the souls of dead enemies by approaching them. Each soul permanently grants 0.75 health and mana. Champions and large minions and monsters always drop a soul. Small minions and monsters only sometimes drop a soul.
&gt;A soul will only drop if the enemy unit dies within 1900-range of Senna. Souls are visible to allies, and only become visible to enemies if the enemy team has vision of Senna. Souls disappear if not picked up after 8 seconds. (Hidden: Senna can pick up allied souls that are dropped near Thresh. Each allied soul permanently grants 0.75 armor and Ability Power.)

&gt;Q – Stay Where You Are: Senna releases an orb of Void energy that travels in a line, dealing magic damage and rooting the first enemy unit it hits for a short time. Senna heals 5% of the damage dealt to the rooted enemy from any source.

&gt;W – Blessing of the Damned: Causes an ally to become insubstantial. That ally takes less damage and can move through minions and champions.

&gt;E – Surge: Senna grants 20% attack speed to an ally for a time. That ally’s basic attacks slow enemies hit by them for one second. (Hidden: If the target of this ability is Lucian, it grants 25% attack speed because that mofugga ain’t broke enough yet)

&gt;R – Break Free: Senna explodes with magical energy, fracturing the world around her and filling it with desperate, angry souls. She creates an area of blighted earth, knocking enemies into the air and damaging them the process. Enemies walking over the blighted earth are slowed, while allies gain a 15% speed boost. The area stays in place until the next time the ability is used.

*scene opens inside a decrepit old gym containing one wrestling ring and a few mats scattered about. The lights flicker as puddles of water collect in various places from leaks in the ceiling. The camera pushes forward to find ""Vile"" Vic Studd standing on the ring apron of said ring, a lit cigarette jutting out the side of his mouth. Inside the ring stand Jimmy Chonga and his son Jimmy Chonga Jr. along with Vic's old running buddies ""Swingin' Sirloin"" Sammy Cox and Booster ""Hot Pants"" McGee. Booster and Sammy are each wearing goggles, soccer shin guards, and massive cups over their genitals as Vic lectures his teammates come this Sunday at ""Living the Gimmick""*

**""Vile"" Vic Studd:** *(sighs)* All right... run it back. AGAIN. 

**Jimmy Chonga Jr.:** Why are we practicing this again? It's not like this situation will ever come up. 

*Vic flings his lit cigarette and Jimmy Jr.*

**Jimmy Jr.:** AIYEEE!!

**Studd:** Why? WHY!? Why is German porn always re-dubbed? Why did Michaelangelo paint a bunch of dudes with their dicks out on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel? Because ART. That's why. Wrestling is an art form and you fuckers are a couple retarded kindergartners sitting in the corner licking the paint off your fingers.

**Sammy:** Harsh Vic.

**Studd:** Well, it's true. I already awoke the beast in Chonga. Now its about teaching you boys a little nuisance. A little psychology. The Tap-Out Kings have been tagging one another for years, we only have a week to get on the same page.

**Jimmy Chonga:** Don't you mean tagging ""with"" one another for years.

**Studd:** I know what I said. Now... again!

*Jimmy and Jimmy Jr. resume their positions in front of Sammy and Booster. Sammy and Booster go to lock up and both Chongas perform simultaneous eye pokes.*

**Studd:** Sweet Shin Music!

*Jimmy and Jimmy Jr. each kick their respective opponents in the shin. Booster and Sammy sell the move and begin hopping on one foot.*

**Studd:** Stomp! Clap!

*The Chongas each slam one foot down on the opposite leg of their opponents catching them off balance followed by a quick double hand clap to both sides of the head.*

**Studd:** Finish them!

*Sammy and Booster are both stunned, hopping on either foot, clutching their hands to their ears as Jimmy and Jimmy Jr. lunge forward with dual knee lifts to the nuts. Sammy and Booster collapse to the ground in pain. Jimmy and Jimmy Jr. high five in joy. Vic enters steps through the ropes and into the ring.*

**Studd:** Now, now... don't go sucking each off quite yet gentleman. That goes for you too down there.

*The camera looks down to find Sammy and Booster tickling one another on the mat, still wearing their ""armor"".*

**Studd:** The Tap-Out Kings are a well oiled machine... like loads and loads of baby oil. You must stay vigilant inside that ring. Always expect the unexpected!

*Vics boot flies out catching Jimmy Jr. in the stomach. He follows that with a throat jab to Jimmy Sr. He then drops both stunned Chongas with a double Studd Stunner leaving both Chongas lying on the mat, clutching at their throats. Vic walks over to the turnbuckle and reaches behind it as if he is going to untie it, instead he pulls out a pack of smokes and a lighter.*

**Studd:** You see boys, you're heading into uncharted waters here. Don't think the brass here in WiR haven't noticed the little following you boys have somehow managed to garner. This industry is fickle and if you don't strike when the iron is hot... well, you may never get another chance. The crowd is begging for something new, something different. And a Mexican father son tag team that take huge bumps and speak broken English in their promos? Just what the doctor ordered.

*Vic lights his cigarette and takes a drag.*

**Studd:** That's what those two pillow biters, The Tap-Out Queens don't get. No one wants to see a couple of generic, tanning salon visiting, axe body spray smellin', cosmo drinkin' fucks with the personality of a half conscious dildo. 

*Vic walks up to the camera side of the ring as Sammy and Booster check to make sure Los Chongas are all right after the sneak attack by Vic Studd.*

**Studd:** You boys think I'm a rat, huh? Pick a number between 0 and 0 and that's just about the number of fucks I give about what you think. I assure you I'm far worse than a rat, gentleman. I'm the God damn Bobby Fisher of ruining people's lives. Hell, most major cities across America have support groups set up to deal with the post-traumatic stress that comes with catching me when I'm in a bad mood. You think I have a sense of certainty and entitlement? You better fucking believe it. That's what you get when you lead a life that earns you a full ride scholarship straight to hell. I know my place. I am the embodiment of living the gimmick. I've solidified my mark in this industry. You hacks are a shit stain on Jimmy Jr.'s tights in comparison.

*Vic leans forward on the ropes and takes a long drag of his cigarette before he stares into the camera, eyes narrowed.*

**Studd:** You boys have made a huge mistake calling me out. Like some hooker puking on her sequins boots in a drug store parking lot at 3 AM on the way to buy an emergency contraceptive level mistake. You shit stabbers may see gold in your future as you look past me and my motley crew and towards the Moonshine Boys or The World's Sexiest Tag Team. And you're right... there is gold in your future. The kind your orthodontist puts in after his assistant is done flossing out the loads of baby gravy you've been dropping in each other's mouths as you're spotting one another at that little dojo of yours.

So this Sunday, after I humble you boys... do me a favor. Get out of that closet. Live your fucking gimmick and be true to yourselves. Bow or break, it doesn't matter. Take turns, that always seemed fair to me. But if there is one thing you take away from dancing with the devil at ""Living the Gimmick"" it's this - Don't Fuck with Vic Studd.

*Vic flicks his cigarette into the camera lens as the scene fades to black*

farming halls is important for when you're interested in awakening monsters but mana and exp is lower than story missions. giant's keep is awesome for getting powerful runes but what you get is totally random so it can be a waste of time if you're still working on fleshing out basic rune setups. story mission bosses are better for collecting runes initially

Would he still be this ridiculous GOAT?

Football is a team sport. Trying to single out individuals becomes a futile process given such a collective scenario. Hell, for all the praise Pele and Maradona get for their performances, the teams they played in weren't exactly rubbish (Brazil 58, 62 and especially 70 were fantastic sides and Argentina 86 was actually quite good - lots of talent with the added boost of the experience and nous of having won a cup a few years previously before Maradona's time). It is all about the collective. A discussion about the best teams of all time makes more sense (though even then, you have to account for different eras).

&gt;Nah, the majority of people don't really care too much about this NSA thing. It's not a big surprise that they were collecting and storing data, that's an obvious thing any agency would do. I'm sure that reddit collects and stores data as well.

&gt;The only le /r/conspiracy idea I have is the USA telling people who can and can't go into space using that meta data, but I only think that because that's what I would do if I were in charge.

&gt;How do y'all even know what's best for our own national security ? People like Snowden ,Greenwald ,and others are selfish for their personal gain and profit off espionage. Glen Greenwald needed the fame to promote his career and to boost his book sales, thus profiting off of treasonous espionage. Snowden on the other hand wanted infamy and notoriety which is priceless to many.

So, this is my concept for Senna post-lantern. She doesn’t have her gun, her body and mind have been shattered by her experiences torn between life and death, and her whole existence has been imbued with Void magic. I decided to go with a support build for her, mostly because I wanted to channel as much Thresh as Lucian, and because it creates the opportunity for a Lucian/Senna bot lane combo. I’ve included a bunch of Thresh-specific hate in the “hidden” passives, because it should be much harder for Thresh to lane against someone so keyed to his biz. Also, I realize I’m super late to the commenting game, and this will probably get buried. I’m cool with that. 

**Passive** – **Broken** Senna, her body shattered by her experiences in the Lantern, does not gain health or mana per level. Instead, she collects the souls of dead enemies by approaching them. Each soul permanently grants 0.75 health and mana. Champions and large minions and monsters always drop a soul. Small minions and monsters only sometimes drop a soul.
A soul will only drop if the enemy unit dies within 1900-range of Senna. Souls are visible to allies, and only become visible to enemies if the enemy team has vision of Thresh. Souls disappear if not picked up after 8 seconds. (*Hidden: Senna can pick up allied souls that are dropped near Thresh. Each allied soul permanently grants 0.75 armor and Ability Power.*)

**Q** – **Caged**: Senna releases an orb of Void energy that travels in a line, dealing magic damage and rooting the first enemy unit it hits for a short time. Senna heals 5% of the damage dealt to the rooted enemy from any source.

**W** – **Ghostly Visage**: Causes an ally to become insubstantial. That ally takes less damage and can move through minions and champions.

**E** – **Spirit Surge**: Senna grants 20% attack speed to an ally for a time. That ally’s basic attacks slow enemies hit by them for one second. (Hidden: If the target of this ability is Lucian, it grants 25% attack speed because that mofugga ain’t broke enough yet)

**R** – **Break Free**: Spiritual energy explodes from the underworld, fracturing the ground around Senna and filling it with desperate, angry souls. She creates an area of blighted earth, knocking enemies into the air and damaging them the process. Enemies walking over the blighted earth are slowed, while allies gain a 15% speed boost. The area stays in place until the next time the ability is used. (*Hidden: If Thresh is caught in the circle, his lantern breaks. Dark Passage goes on cooldown. If Dark Passage was already on cooldown, its cooldown duration is doubled. While Dark Passage is on cooldown, Thresh cannot collect souls.*)

Far, far too many games have been destroyed from the inside out by becoming too complicated. The glitching is a concern. As for difficulty, it could be scaled back if losing the ball due to mishandling were harder to do. 
Still, I can see where this could be too complicated once you get into knots of players fighting over possession of the ball. Essentially dribbling elongates the target for opponents to hit/steal from, meaning several players converging on the ball could create some real craziness. To me, that isn't a dealbreaker, since this merely reinforces the need for teamwork, proper passing, and creating space via boosting and positioning. 
Of course, I have all kinds of crazy notions that probably don't fit with Supraball's design at all, such as removing AutoPassing entirely (Volley Only).
Not to mention literally slowing the game speed down to about 80% of current. Or even slowing the game speed down based on ping discrepancy between players, similar to EVE Online's method of server lag compensation: the higher the collective ping, or the greater the discrepancy between ping, the slower the game speed, down to about 70% of normal. Every time the ball resets after a goal, the server adjusts speed based upon ping of players. This doesn't happen in realtime, just at resets. Then again, with global Internet connections getting faster and faster, this is probably pointless, not to mention messing with the fast-paced nature of the game itself.",1,gloves0ff,True,t3_2afa2k,0,ciuhew7,0,1434663058,
0,,t1_ciuh9os,2,1405087861,,t3_2aethb,False,bartenders,False,,t5_2smw0,"Wow, what an asshole. I've worked in a lot of pubs round the UK and have had managers do things like this but never all at once in one establishment.

First off adding the waste beer to a dark ale is just mank. Maybe it was acceptable 20 years ago but now it's just not something that should be done. If he's mixing different beers, im pretty sure thats illegal. 

Unfortunately the tips issue isnt something easily solved. I havnt checked up on the law in a while but it use to be unless a customer hands you a tip personally then tips are the property of the establishment and can use them how they see fit *except* to make up your wage packet. The law may have changed since then so definitely worth checking up on.

Most pubs i've worked in though have someone trustworthy who collects all the tips, keeps them on site, and distributes then out at the end of the month (called a troncmaster). Easier said than done I know. You are also suppose to pay taxes on tips, though usually you just get it in cash. If you establishment wants to go that route then they should be on your wage slip.

So it sounds like your manager is either just using all this tip money to boost takings or pocketing it. Either way, he's a fucking dick. No Xmas party is just pathetic and something the owner should be involved in deciding, not just the manager. Treating a 17yr old pot washer like that is just awful, especially on 4 quid an hour. What area of the UK do you work in by the way? Although legal, that still seems ridiculously low. My first job was a pot washer in a pub 14 years ago and I got £4 an hour then.

The breaks issue is hard too, simply because its the service industry and 'normal' break rules are a grey area. Legally, in the UK, you are entitled to a 20 minutes uninterrupted break every 6hrs work. So that means not just spreading 20mins break over 6hrs, that's 20mins in one go. Obviously that rule gets waived often in the service industry but if you're getting no breaks at all, it really is pretty illegal. 

Do you have a shift manager or supervisor you can air your concerns to? That might be a place to get the ball rolling. If not then the owner? Do you really want to keep this job? If you're not fussed then maybe even confront him. Don't be super aggressive or swear but be assertive. Bring up your rights as an employee only if he really isn't listening as going into the conversation saying ""By law, I'm entitled ...blah blah"" will make him super defensive form the get go. If you want to get serious, an anon tip to trading standards or health and safety might be in order.

The pub industry is a lot different from the Bar business in the States. Most pubs will hire people with little to no experience, the pay is shitty and tips are even shittier. The one plus side this is that there is always pubs looking for staff because the turnover is so high. If you have pub experience, you'll definitely be ahead of most applicants and it's a piece of piss to find another pub job. Good luck.",2,mbhd,True,t3_2aethb,0,ciuh9os,0,1434662986,

You see, people did not play Dark Souls over and over again because they love repetition, they did it because each time they played, they got to approach it from a different angle. It was the exact same game, but both the world design *and mechanics* encouraged creative expression. But with Dark Souls II's comparatively linear progression, combined with the fact that any sort of ""builds"" now have an expiration date, I don't know how anyone could possibly defend a truly ill-informed and shortsighted mechanic like SM.

I don't PvP, but I know for sure that those that do either actively criticize SM-based matchmaking or have already moved back to Demon's Souls and/or DaS. Even popular Youtubers who are on good terms with FROM, and whose incomes are supplemented/dependent on making and sharing Souls-related content for the masses have a difficult time not trashing what SM has turned PvP into.

I do co-op, though -- well, I did, before I realized that trying to maintain a specialized/creative build was a complete waste of time, and that all creativity through character creation ended with what my characters face looks like. Hell, I even have to change my *armor* to boost my Item Discovery rate now, further cementing DaS2's contempt for creative expression.

And on the topic armor sets, if SM is supposed to represent a player's skill and experience, this concept is completely *antithetical* to the developer's *deliberate choice* to have players spend hours grinding away at enemies for rare weapons and armors sets. Grinding sessions like these leads to the absorption of many, many souls. It took me over three hours (that I'll never get back) to complete the Mad Warrior armor, and that's just one of the easier ones to collect.

So if only a ""very vocal minority niche"" see Soul Memory as a complete and utter farce, then A) it's pretty impressive that my comments on the subject aren't always downvoted into oblivion, and B) I'm glad to be a part of a small group of people that *aren't* OK that a sequel to Dark Souls -- an imperfect game with perfect goals and ideas -- has a mechanic that completely undermines what made players return to DeS/DaS time and time again.",1,Risergy,True,t3_2adw9h,1,ciudjt3,0,1435474427,

http://jwleaf.org/html/BGI-researching-high-IQ-and-genetics.html

The research is spearheaded by Steven Hsu who has written some ideas about doing in vitro genetic testing for intelligence to select highly intelligent fertilized eggs as an eugenics programme. There is a wide range of IQ differences between siblings from the same family so it's predicted this could boost average IQ by at least 15+ if female egg cells can be mass cloned/created.

Here's an interview with him: http://intelligence.org/2013/08/31/stephen-hsu-on-cognitive-genomics/

&gt;Luke: How feasible do you think “iterated embryo selection” will be, over the next several decades, for the amplification of cognitive abilities via genetic selection?

&gt;Background for our readers: iterated embryo selection is a plausible future technology that could allow strong genetic selection for intelligence without needing to wait 15-20 years between generations. It was first described in detail in the FAQ for MIRI’s The Uncertain Future project (see Rayhawk et al. 2009), was later described in a book (Miller 2012), and was finally published in a journal in Sparrow (2013).

&gt;Stephen: I have no particular insight into specific challenges related to producing gametes from pluripotent stem cells. It’s not my area of expertise. However, I am confident that genomic selection for traits such as g will be possible. I would be surprised if, after analyzing millions of genotype-phenotype pairs, we were not able to produce a predictive model that captures, say, 50% of variance in g. That means, roughly, we might be able to predict g from genotype with standard error of somewhat less than a population standard deviation (e.g., 10 IQ points; note I don’t think the real world “meaning” of g is better defined than within an error of this size). This means that selection on g can proceed relatively efficiently, assuming the basic reproductive technologies are under control.

&gt;I think there is good evidence that existing genetic variants in the human population (i.e., alleles affecting intelligence that are found today in the collective world population, but not necessarily in a single person) can be combined to produce a phenotype which is far beyond anything yet seen in human history. This would not surprise an animal or plant breeder — experiments on corn, cows, chickens, drosophila, etc. have shifted population means by many standard deviations (e.g., +30 SD in the case of corn).

&gt;Let me add that, in my opinion, each society has to decide for itself (e.g. through democratic process) whether it wants to legalize or forbid activities that amount to genetic engineering. Intelligent people can reasonably disagree as to whether such activity is wise.",2,Jewish_NeoCon2,True,t3_2abws7,0,citsjzp,0,1434649815,

Mythology is used to buy level i90 gear, and there's no limit on how much you can collect per week.

Soldiery is used to buy level i100 gear (which can further be upgraded to i110 gear), but you can only collect 450 Soldiery per week.

Right-side accessories and the belt cost 375 Tomestones a piece. Left-side armor costs 495 for boots, hat, gloves and 825 (I think) for legs and body. So there's a healthy amount of Tomestones you need collect.

But how do you get those, you may ask...

Do your roulettes! Every day, try to do the Main Story and Low Level roulettes. You won't have Trial roulettes unlocked now until you beat up to the latest storyline trial, not to mention all the other ones before it, and a few side-quest ones. But the Main Story and Low Level roulettes will still give you 100+ Tomestone of Mythology! On top of that, if someone is new to the dungeon, you get bonus Mythology.

In addition, unlock all of the level 50 ""Hard Mode"" dungeons you can. Most unlock in Mor Dhona, but a few unlock in Vesper Bay and the three main towns, I beleve. They include

* Wanderer's Palace
* Amdapor Keep
* Haukke Manor (Hard Mode)
* Copperbell Mines (Hard Mode)
* Pharos Sirius
* Brayflox Longstop (Hard Mode)
* Halitali (Hard Mode)
* The Lost City of Amdapor

I listed them roughly in the order of difficulty, but, of course, opinions vary.

I believe you'll need around i45-i55 to enter these dungeons. You'll want to get the best weapon you can easily obtain for these, as weapon damage is the single biggest stat boost you can get for your character. The easiest ones to get are the level i55 Grand Company weapon, supposing you've ranked yourself up sufficiently. You could probably also just buy something for the market boards for not too much gil.

Completing each of these for the first time will get you bonus Tomestones of Mythology, and some of them will drop i50+ gear. The gear is nice, but not the focus. The things you'll be buying with Mythology and Soldiery are i90 and i100, so they're much better than these drops. Your focus is on getting as much Mythology as possible, while capping your Soldiery at 450/week from now on. And once you complete all of them once, you'll have unlocked the Hard Mode roulette, which is another great source of daily Myth/Soldiery

If your goal is raiding, this is your focus. Get all of those i90 Mythology pieces that you can.

The Relic quest, as others have mentioned, require your average gear iLvl to be around i60, so you'll need to upgrade your gear anyway before you get your weapon. As others have mentioned (as well as myself above), weapon damage is the single most important stat for increasing your effectiveness, so you'll not want to ignore your relic quest. It's a relatively easy way to get access to an i80, and later i90 weapon. Whether you choose to upgrade it beyond that is up to you, but it's a very good weapon to get until you find alternative ways of getting i90+ weapons.

Don't ignore your storyline, though. 3 (I think) of the trials needed to unlock the Trial roulette are bound to the storyline, one is bound to the Hildebrand storyline, and Ultima Hard Mode is a quest from Mor Dhona. Trials are a really easy way to get some myth/soldiery every day, especially now that you get a bonus if the person is new to the fight.

That's really about it, though. Just focus on getting Myth/Soldiery, do the hard mode dungeons and ultimately settle into a comfortable level of dungeon farming/daily roulettes for myth.

Once you get your iLvl to i70, you can start working on the 3 new ""Expert"" dungeons

* Tam Tara (Hard Mode)
* Stone Vigil (Hard Mode)
* Hullbreaker Isle

Those three will be the best way to get Soldiery using the Expert roulette (once you have done each of them once)

This isn't the be-all end-all way to gear. There's lots of other suggestions posted. I have a friend who recently hit 50, so I'm helping her with all this stuff, too. It's definitely overwhelming for a new person. Just slowly knock stuff out, and you'll get there.

My biggest advice is to not get hung up on the low drop rates of i50-i55 gear from those lowbie dungeons. Just worry about getting the Myth to buy the i90 pieces.",5,Ridere,True,t3_2abq44,0,cith3qj,0,1434642767,

I've always been a proponent for every weapon having a selection of more than 5 skills that from which you could choose which 5 to use.

&gt; In GW2, runes have been turned into the useless little things that, while increasing the extremely streamlined traits of Power, Vitality, etc., don't really do much to add to your overall power input, making you feel as if you are doing the same damage at Level 80 that you were doing at Level 50.

Scholar Runes increasing your dps by 10%, Strength runes making warriors crazy might stackers, Melandru runes basically making warriors immune to conditions in wvw, Pirate rune summoning a bird as strong as a base ranger pet. Ye, runes are completely useless.

&gt;I kind of already do this. I present my troubled brain with a bunch of alternatives, like ""they might've done that to anyone"" or ""maybe they have other problems of their own"" or ""maybe the last person they met was mean"", but just that guttural feeling of ""but it was probably you, it's always been you, how do you really know it's not? you've felt lonely for so long, remember?"" just sits there while my brain scrambles to latch on to some beacon of hope but can't find any.

This is a really good start, and I'm glad you have already figured this out.

I think the next thing is to start to build upon this by allowing people into your life that value you and give you positive feedback. A good, supportive therapist might be helpful, but even a pet that you can build an attachment to can be just as good. Dogs are wonderful for this, but cats or rabbits or rats are still good because they will be non-judgmental and appreciative of your existence.

Another thing that might help is collecting a bunch of keepsakes and mementos that show you that you are a valuable human being who is loved. Letters, cards, notes, awards – things like that. Stuff that means something to you. If you keep them, then you can use them as a way of proving to yourself that you are a good person and that you make a positive contribution to people around you and to the world.

If you have the time, you could also consider volunteering because this will give you a confidence boost and it will help remind you of your positive contributions.

&gt;Every time I'm in an interaction with someone I'm not entirely comfortable with, it always feels like an exam. I try to notice things that likable people do and emulate them on my own, so when the reaction is positive, I get super happy like 'yes! all my studying worked' and when it's neutral or negative, I have to recheck all my steps, evaluate them, think of what I did wrong, and guess whether I was okay or not. So, relating to that example, the service guy doesn't matter, but the reaction people have of me does matter, so every instance to me is a reflection on that.

I can really sympathize with this.

I think that this attitude has a lot to do with growing up with narcissistic parents – feeling like you are always being examined or like you are on trial comes from the way that you weren't loved unconditionally as a child. Instead you were constantly taught to focus on their own state to try and do the ""right"" thing (whatever that was at the time). You got positive feedback when you did what your N parent wanted you to do at the time, and not for your own contributions and achievements. In a way this trained you to place your own self-worth in how much validation you got from other people rather than developing a sense of self-worth that is independent of what people may or may not think of you.

Think of a confident person that you know. If they encounter difficult people or situations, or if they mess up, it rolls off their back because deep down they believe that they are a good person and that they are worth more than what one person thinks. They don't believe that their most recent mistake is proof that they are a terrible human being, they take it as a learning experience at best or as a mishap at worst.

And deep down everyone make mistakes all the time. That's pretty much the only way of really learning. So it's a difference in attitude that makes all the difference. I know that my own response to mistakes is either to shut down, or to be incredibly self-critical (which is the bad side of me being a perfectionist). 

When I was a child nobody reassured me that when I made a mistake or I didn't achieve to my expectations (or to someone else's expectations). It was used as evidence against me to prove that I wasn't good enough. So I internalized this and now whenever I make a mistake, I am judged or graded, or I just do something which I don't believe is good enough I then immediately feel worse about myself because that's the way of thinking that I was taught by my parents.

So this is where having a person who knows that you are valuable comes in handy – when you are feeling bad about yourself, if you trust this person, they can help explain to you why this shouldn't affect how you feel about yourself, and they can remind you of the reasons why you are still a good person. The aim will be to gradually allow them to teach you to love and value yourself, and to build your self-confidence.

You will also need to learn that it's okay to reflect on your previous experiences, but to pour over every minute detail isn't a healthy thing to do. Not only will you find mistakes and errors you made (you know that saying – when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail? That's how it is when you revisit your every social interaction looking for where you didn't live up to your own standards and for every mistake). You should trust in that other people around you will be adult about things and they will let you know if you have done something wrong or made a mistake. After all you can't read minds. Healthy adults communicate their needs to other people, and then healthy adults respond to this as best they can. It's as unhealthy to expect that you'll magically fulfill someone's needs as it is to expect that someone else will do that for you (though I bet your N parent *did* expect that you'd fulfill their every need without even asking).

&gt;I moved a lot as a kid, was emotionally bullied at school via gossip and rejection, not to mention the problems at home, so I've never felt like I'm just likable nor had a stable group of friends to fall back on.

Moving around a lot is very common for abusive households. It makes it easier for whoever has control to keep everyone else isolated and dependent on them. It also disrupts the formation of long-term trusting relationships with others.

Another thing which is really common is for children who are abused to be bullied at school because they don't fit in properly, they don't get their needs met and so they can be demanding or emotional, and perhaps worst of all they send out victim signals to others which means that people who have a tendency to victimize others will often exploit, harass, and abuse them. It's hard to explain without going into great detail, but there's a pattern of abuse where a victim has lowered self esteem, becomes used to not getting their needs met, is unsupported by friends and family, does not have firm boundaries, and a bunch of other things which means that they are really liable to being trapped in another abusive relationship (where a healthy person would get to a point where they say enough is enough and they leave, or they know that they don't deserve to be treated that way etc. etc.)

It's going to be a tough journey, but the way to heal from this stuff is to gradually learn to accept yourself and then to build trust and ongoing relationships with others. It will start from that one trustworthy person who facilitates your learning about yourself and it will grow from there.

Also, lots of people only have a handful of close friends – sometimes only one or two. That's totally fine. Don't expect that you need to have 50 BFFs or anything like that, especially given the experiences you have had growing up. It's about quality, not quantity.

&gt;I'm just sick of that empty pit where a soul should be; the toxic shame.

This is a good sign. It means that you are rejecting what you have learned about yourself. I know how pervasive and awful it is, and how crippling it is, but you need to gradually work through it. A journal orks well here because you can put those things down (and hopefully out of your head too), and you can come back to them in a month to realize just how unimportant they are to you now. The perspective that comes with time helps. 

A therapeutic relationship can also help because it will allow you the opportunity to express some of this shame and help you to get a healthier perspective on it.

A little guilt or shame isn't necessarily the worst thing in the world – it's a way of letting yourself know when you've messed up or you have down something badly. It's a way to help you learn and to help you have better relationships. You could think of it sort of like your immune system – it does some things which don't feel very pleasant (sneezing, fever, demanding that you stay in bed, getting rid of the bad stuff in your stomach etc.) but which actually help you out in the long term.

Toxic shame is different. It's like an auto-immune disorder or severe allergies. Instead of dealing with things appropriately, it goes into overdrive and starts attacking your system and making you *more* unwell rather than helping you stay healthy.

There are two types of quests, collection quests and boss battles. 

Collection quests are exactly as it sound you and your party compete dailies in order to have a random chance at finding the item you are looking for. You usually have to collect a decently high number of items, I know for the recent Easter quest it was 100 eggs which doesn't sound like a lot until you realize that each person can usually only find 3-10 depending on their Perception lvl and any boosts that people in your party cast to give you help.  Some collection quests also unlock certain boss quests and/or give you an pet eggs. 

For boss battles for every daily or To-Do you do does damage to the boss and every daily you leave incomplete they do damage to you, this is on top of the normal damage you'd receive for not completing the daily. So when battling a boss your hit more often and with bigger penalties for not doing a daily. Bosses usually have very high health which makes killing them hard unless you have a decent size party. 

With regards to quests, HabitRPG also holds certain community events for holidays where they give out scrolls for free.  Such as one for Easter, Christmas, etc.

Currently there is a community boss battle going on in which everyone who is registered is participating in. This one is a little different as there is no opt in so it doesn't hurt you every day but as the community fails to complete so many dailies it will do damage either to a select section of the community or to something on the website itself  (based on the wording in the quest I think the Tavern chat may get taken down should it attack). Should we complete the battle everyone will get 900xp, a pet shrimp, a mount shrimp, and 90 gold. 

=========
=========
Even if you do not participate in quests HabitRPG provides for some motivation for getting your tasks and dailies done.  For each dailey you have finished you gain money (gold and silver), xp, and have a chance of finding a pet egg or hatching potion (this is based on your Perception stat). For each dailey you do not finish it will do damage to your character at the Cron time or dailey reset time (midnight, unless you set a custom time). The object is to keep your character alive.

As you gain xp you can level up and when you level up you can apply a point to your stats. There are 4 stats: Strength, Intelligence, Constitution, and Perception. Strength helps in doing a critical hit which gives more xp and gold than normal hits, it also allows you to do more damage to bosses. Intelligence increase the amount of XP you gain when you do a task and also increase the mana you can have, which is used to cast spells (you'll need to read the wiki to see what each spell does).  Constitution reduces the damage you have done by dailies and bosses. Perception increases the gold you have and increases the chance of finding items when you complete a daily.

With gold and silver you can purchase armor to customize and protect your character or you can use it on custom rewards for yourself. Each class has it's own sets of armor they can purchase that boosts one or more stat and then subscribers also get costume armor they can purchase every month. The rest of us get a chance for costume armor for different events, such as holidays. For example they just recently release a pirate outfit to everyone in build up to the community boss battle that I spoke about above.  

You also have the option of doing community challenges, which is where a member of the community will put of crystals and create some dailies and challenges that participants can complete. After a certain time the individual can then look through who completed them and reward them with the gems. It's a good way to compete with friends and strangers as well as learn a new routines.

Of course there is also guilds that you can join that usually focus on a specific area. Each guild has a private chat place and you can have guild only quests that relate to the topic of the guild. 

There are also the ability to have pets and mounts, although at this current time they do not offer any benefit other than for looks, although there is some talk of making them more useful in the future.

**TLDR:** There is a lot of RPG elements, you just may not see them starting out. Boss battle deal damage and give you rewards. Collection quest give you items.

The 'fallen angel' archetype appears throughout many of our ancient writings and I don't believe there is any real link to satan/evil as being the route of concept. 
I remember reading a very interesting piece of writing (hidden-hand interview) that states that the fallen angels were beings of a higher spiritual plane of existence from Venus (the Star of Lucifer), who we're incarnated onto earth to sort of give us a spiritual boost as our deity yaweh had deliberately stunted our spiritual side. The concept of a deity was explained interestingly too.

We exist as a single being that is made up of billions of smaller lifeforms. In the same way, Earths 'soul' is simply all of it's inhabitants collective souls connected together. That in turn is just a smaller part of an even greater soul complex and so on and so forth.

I know for most of you this fits into the religious hog-wash crap that you normally ignore as I use too. I had a realization a while back however that allowed me to believe there could be some sort of higher power.

It all starts with the humble slime mold. A wonderfully none-complex organism that on it's own is little more than a spec of slime but when connected to millions of it's peers then somehow it gains some morsel of what we may call intelligence allowing it to solve simple puzzles like mazes.
Now if we assume that we as human beings are connected on a none-physical level (can elaborate on this if needed) then it would be only logical to assume the sum of all of us would be more intelligent and capable than us as individuals.
Now as a general trend the more complicated a system is (the more connections, e.g synapses in a human brain) the more able that system is to do 'things'. The more intelligent it appears to be.
Now if space and time exist in a hologram form like many believe and time/space is just a clever illusion, then all matter/energy that does exist, will exist or has existed is all connected together. The whole universe would therefore be the most complicated and 'intelligent' entity possible.",2,[deleted],True,t3_2a5ku2,0,cishh1x,0,1435475840,

Its not because it is more ""available"" to everyone or some other PR reasoning behind it.

They wanted to bring another incentive to buy booster packs for people that already have almost every card in golden.

When they noticed the gold hoarding is taking place they refrained from announcing the pricing to think how to handle it.
Now they also handled it for upcoming real card expansions that gets you a much bigger new pool of cards in for of a booster.

People that don't want to spend houndreds of dollars will never be able to collect every golden card in the game and therefore won't be able to save up masses of gold for a release of a new booster pack.

thats why i have political ambitions for Florida to have a revolution and annex from the country-it's got absurd -ill give you plan under here because i think the countries just to big for Washington_dc to manage 

the old way they used to do countries is like a flag -the four corners - cali-wash state-NE -fl and then have the central gov in the middle of the cross-diff(i wounder if some people in other countries know they are different wash state and DC) but you have in each state a representative like rick Scott now in fl so you have 51 reps(always odd so no stalemates ) they concentrate on each state not the country and they have elections based on pop vote and they have taxes collected in state and spent in state not to central gov because they don't know each states demographics they need people who live and know those states and the businesses in those because they know how to spend the money in those states to make them successful

but as for Florida-if we left and became own country we would be 58th in world for population http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population

i believe we should just take the state and have a plan for the population because when the central gov becomes a hindrance then it is the governors to protect there population
Annex Florida
revalue the dollar rate in the state to a realistic value(get all the economists from the universities and gov and business to sit down together and work one out) 

by that revaluation it increases the amount of money in the economy-the more money the more disposable income to spend on products because of more demand so producers produce more -higher profits and more jobs

also makes manufacturing cheaper because less cost to produce -give tax breaks to companies who move back in to produce-this increases employment and the fact more employment -more money to be spent on goods-

also people can afford health insurance again so that takes stress off the social systems and if the Florida gov ran the health insurance and everyone was paying in it would cost less per family and you would have less serious illness because you make maintenance visits for all kids and people every 6 mths 
this way insurance companies still make money doctors nurses still make money because they are constantly doing maintenance -in fact it would move back to a more family doc idea because they see the doctor more often-include dental and optical-if you provide health insurance that means the whole body not just parts bundle them into one -if the prices are lower then at least people have them if they need them 
lower exchange rate brings in tourists which is a large sector here in Florida and increased tourists means local hotels and businesses benefit and the lower exchange rate means people visiting will spend more at more stores -it benefits all sorts of businesses-which means they more quantity which means the manufacturing increases

revalued dollar- brings in investment money so banks benefit-more employment banks make more loans at lower rates and so more home sales so construction industry increases-introduce proactive environmental rules-open our own stock exchange that is open 24 hrs a day to combat time change-the fact is a 5hr advantage in Europe means they can lead the markets in there own way if you had a market open you would have overseas investors buying and selling at all hours-when London stock exchange opens it's 4am on the east coast -that's 5hrs for brokers there to affect the markets before we open and we then have those deals done and we have to live with them open 24hrs you see what other brokers are doing to affect them then have another shift come in -it's a competitive market

increase incomes more food sold farmers make more money-also we then have control of some of the commodities markets -and we can export to islands and other states

i mean by revaluation we do a one time amnesty on money brought in-and don't ask don't tell -and take a third of that - give some to each Florida resident as kind of a pay off so they have a lump sum to spend eg give everyone 10 000 that would be spent in the economy so you get an automatic boost-the  gov buys all the old metals and recycle them to use in gov projects -have a deal with waste management groups on plastics and metals for a new magnetic freight railroad-float it on new stock exchange
you form boards for education with people who work in it-with new valuation invest in education-that's whats keeps us moving forward because then new ideas are always coming-allow unis to work like companies let departments develop ideas and others build it-eg english -have your own printing and let kids publish novels that are good and this way they learn business at school to take to businesses outside
develop new car technology and let the physics departs join in and engineering build it
i mean if companies can build tablets that sell to charities in Africa spend  money on buying stuff for schools or you get each store to donate 3-4 products -that would add up and split them between schools and have internet teaching to-there are great ideas like epic rap battles on you tube-take out the language and add in what they did in history or science think how we hum songs- get stuck in your head-look into other ways of learning and learn that way and have people like scientists doing 10 min internet class each day and make it fun
so thats part of it-i mean we can sit around and wait for it to get better-or we could just make Florida the greatest nation in the world and lead by example-also a peninsular so easy to defend via navy-one way in one way out boarder wise and join with jamacia-they trained 00 units in the past and hire the vets to train new recruits-you still need an army but if you have the best trained and best tech there will always be a doubt what trick you'll pull out

* Ace Chef Lancia for her great boost in HC drops and increased BC drops during Sparks on top of her SBB's fantastic healing and ATK boost, or

0,,t1_cisdhit,1,1404890391,,t3_2a7pzf,1404890588,Guildwars2,False,,t5_2r9po,"To put this into perspective, there are 318,355,000 people in the USA. There are 1,365,480,000 people in China (19% of the Earth's population). You could add one billion people the population of the USA (more than triple it's current population) and it wouldn't equal China's population (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population). The sales figure for GW2 in China isn't as impressive when you consider how large the population of the country is.

Now to put that all into context of what these figures usually try to accomplish (the MMO population competition), August last year (GW2's one year anniversary) Guild Wars 2 had sold just over 3,500,000 copies (https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/guild-wars-2-the-first-year/) which was 500,000 more than the figure in January (five months after launch - https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/colin-johanson-on-guild-wars-2-in-the-months-ahead/).  At different times, World of Warcraft has hit at or above 10 million active subcribers (http://wow.joystiq.com/tag/wow-subscriber-numbers/). Active subscribers (not free trials, not people who bought the game at launch and haven't played since then, active subscribers giving Blizzard money each month). As of May this year there are 7.6 million active subscribers to WoW (http://venturebeat.com/2014/05/06/world-of-warcraft-subscriptions-numbers-bleed-again/), likely to boost back up when the expansion hits later this year. Keep in mind an active subscriber of WoW has most likely purchased Vannilla, BC, WotLK, Cataclysm and MoP, a game sold for GW2 is a single purchase with a possibility of microtransactions and a high likelihood that that player no longer plays GW2.

So what does this all mean? Firstly, that China is a huge market for MMO sales (http://www.forbes.com/sites/johngaudiosi/2012/06/06/booming-chinese-mmo-games-market-forecast-to-generate-6-1-billion-in-2012/). Developers like Blizzard, ArenaNet and Riot are going to use whatever figures they want to use that gives them the best sounding headline (Blizzard will focus on subscription numbers, ArenaNet will focus on sales, Riot will focus on active players, I'll leave it to you to decide which best represents financial revenue and active player population - you likely won't see ArenaNet boast above active players like Blizzard unless they think it frames their game as being as successful or more than WoW). Guild Wars 2 is still doing well, but we are more than likely nearing the end of the game's peak (in terms of sales and popularity). With sales slowing down, the last major market has been launched in (if China is anything like the initial launch, sales will begin to slow down in the next three or four months and the population will dramatically decrease). The only mile stone left in the game's future that might significantly alter the population (imo) is the game going F2P (GW1 still isn't F2P and several formats, like PvP died due to population issues) or an expansion (until I see figures showing season two's new maps equals an expansion-like boost in population - too late imo as season one branded Living Story as no-new-maps and that image won't change).

Fortunately for us, none of this really matters because imo Season Two is the Living World hitting its stride. As players we are likely to get a satisfying gaming experience with more content to sink our teeth in, more maps and world stories to explore (not just Scarlet but the world of Tyria) and maybe even more in-game items to collect. It likely won't scratch that expansion itch for a lot of players (new races, new weapon skills, new classes, new huge chunk of content to consume all at once including dungeons, weapon skins and armour skins) but if you're playing GW2 anyway you will probably enjoy it.",1,tummlykins,True,t3_2a7pzf,1,cisdhit,0,1434622604,

Instead, I would break the mission up into 2 subparts.  Once you get to Eve and aerobrake into orbit, I would detach a probe lander with some science gear and antennas.  The manned ship could do flyby science and land on Gilly before returning to Kerbin.

If you really want to get better, you need to learn about delta-v, TWR, and install Kerbal Engineer or MechJeb.  You'll be able to plan missions much easier since you will have a pretty good idea of your ship's capabilities before you launch.

Some points about it's design:

* The ship looks like a mun / minmus return ship and would probably function for that well.  I would recommend a decoupler between the pod and the rest of the ship.  You can collect the science on EVA and store it in the pod, so there is no need to bring it back.
* The landing legs could be set wider for an easier time not tipping over.  They are fine for flatter surfaces and the reaction wheel will help a lot, but a wide base is nice.  Putting science bays with landing legs on radial decouplers is a good option.  You can collect the science before liftoff and ditch them as you take off.
* Multiple antennas are a must as you found out.  I try to put them in hard to break locations.  Redundant power is also a huge plus in designs.
* The booster probably has a pretty high thrust to weight ratio and may fly too fast in the first stage (efficiency wise).  Knowing the terminal velocity and staying close to it until 10km after liftoff is very helpful.  The Kerbal Engineer or MechJeb mods help a lot for this.

At first, it would literally take me 10+ custom/ai games just to work up the courage to play ranked. It is a very common problem in ranked games but with a past of playing the trueskill ranking system of halo for years, I knew I could and HAD to do it. Nevertheless, it still would take quite a bit to work myself through it, oddly enough, I found that streaming (even if no one watched) gave me a pretty nice boost to play. 

I have not had the same anxiety playing Hearthstone, but I know the feeling nonetheless. I have only really gotten into the ranked play last season. I'd stay ~20-17 but had no real desire to climb because I really wanted to collect all the cards, so I went back and forth from arena. Last season, 11 was my highest and I would have kept going but the season ended and I had to travel home because my dad had sugery (long story, he is doing great). I didn't get to play towards the end when I was doing really well. 

What I realized in any kind of trueskill ranked type of game is that it really is no big deal to lose. Think about it this way, you are GOING to lose. No one has a 100% winrate in any competitive game. The best players in the world in any game lose, and quite a bit. It is what you do with your losses. You can get angry (like me lol), you can quit playing, or you can learn from what you did wrong and get better by not doing it the same way again (I try to do this too). The reason players get as good as they do is not because they constantly win, but because of the countless games they continue to play, seeing the same situations unfold again and again.

I think you misunderstood what the FAQ means here.

It's not that welfare is being given out fraudulently that causes the money loss.  Afterall, BI would give money to *everyone* so those ""fraudulent"" cases would suddenly stop being ""fraudulent"" under BI.

No, the issue is that we have an *entire industry* built around *preventing* that fraud.  There are people who's entire career is set around making sure other people don't commit welfare fraud.  There are case workers, government contracts, and bureaucracy middle men all along the way whose entire jobs are only in existence to stop other people from getting the assistance they applied for.  Instead of paying these salaries, we simply convert that money into the BI fund.  

This is a *piece* of the picture, remember.  It's not the only piece, and it doesn't fund BI single handedly.

&gt; Elimination of minimum wage.  Surely that means wages going down, and with income tax being a % of income, income tax collectively will go down.

Eh... almost.

No minimum wage means wages will change.  Some will go down, but others will go up.  

You see, the real beauty of BI is in the fact that it gives workers bargaining rights.  If you don't need to work in order to feed yourself/your family, you're given the option to say ""You know what, $4/hour just isn't worth my time.  I'd rather be home with my kids.""  

This puts pressure on businesses to provide incentive for their workers.  Part of this might be in wages, or just working condition improvements.  But the point is that it doesn't necessitate lower wages just because there's no minimum wage in effect.

But more importantly, you need to think about the long term impacts of how BI would effect the economy, and thus income tax.

If all people have a living wage, all people are able to buy necessities (food/water/shelter).  That means the market for these necessities expands.  Food deserts will start to vanish because there's now an economic incentive to provide quality food to even low income neighborhoods.

As businesses crop up to support the new spending freedom that the lower class has, there will be a general boost to the economy.  New jobs are created, cash circulates more freely within communities, and every step of the way the government gets to take their cut.  From sales tax at these new businesses to income tax for people working at those businesses.


As for your other points, I don't particularly agree with many of them as being ways to approach BI funding, so I won't comment on them.

What I will say, is that BI should be thought of more as an investment than as a zero sum in-out loop.  We shouldn't expect BI to necessarily ""pay for itself"" instantaneously.  Like all investments, you're putting money into something that you believe will be profitable in the future, with a promise of a cut of that profit later on.  The thing we are investing in is our own citizens.  We're investing in the idea that people want to do great things, and that if citizens aren't forced into minimum wage jobs simply in order to survive, then their ambitions can be fulfilled and we will see a massive growth in all aspects of our country.

Out of honour summons you can also collect  units called Magress and Altro which all also turn into powerful 6 units if you are lucky enough to pull them (incidentally you can also pull the other starter units). 

You can eventually build a powerful team without spending money (usually through vortex events and honour summons) but there are are no units that turn into 6 star that can be encountered in the normal dungeons of the game.

my advice would be to grab one of the starter healing units early (you will encounter them a lot) on like priest Merith, geomancer claris, dancer may or sage mimir to be a healer until you get something better. personally I would get the one that aligns with the element of your leader assuming you are using one of the starters, this will at least boost the power of the healers attack while you are fighting. for example if you chose Eze you may want May, if you chose lance it would be claris and if you chose vargas... well there isn't an early fire healer :( so just pick the one you like the look of best. they are very common and I would chose a gardian because they have better defence and they are not there to be offensive units.

As a new starter to the game i would also recommend a app called BF guide, its like a pokedex for the game and I use it a lot",3,TeaBadger,True,t3_2a4mut,0,cirnhk0,0,1434610110,

&gt; Economist says Mc Donald's is not in the fast-food business and no one bats an eye. Game designer says Quake isn't a shooter and everyone loses their minds. ;)

It's a funny way to make a point, I understand, but I suspect would be equally critical if I were an economist and I heard an economist make that statement because it's not actually accurate.  

Both examples fall down if you actually remove these primary pillars from the equation (as is implied).  Mcdonalds is first and foremost in the fast food business, and the moment they stop selling burger and fries, their primary economic engine evaporates, all the strategies they are using to maximize the build on top of that crumble.  Is their a *substantially* more complex business model built on top of selling fast food?  Yes, absolutely!  But the representation of this company not being in the business of fast food is just incorrect and falls apart if actually put into action.

The same is true of quake, and making the claim of it not being a shooter only serves to distract from the very strong content/points you make afterwards.  If you removed all of the firearms from quake...  item control doesn't mean a whole lot, as the primary motivation loop for the player has dissolved. I can collect all the mega-health boosts and super armor pickups I want...  but without the firearms aspect of the game, I'm going to want to pick up ~0-1 and then the game is done.  So to say that the game isn't a shooter is a point not worth making.  However, highlighting the subtle and complex layers of how the item control system bolsters the main gameplay of shooting is definitely worth talking about, and what the latter half of your video does a good job doing.  

I don't think there is anything wrong with making the video ""Quake: Unseen Depth of Gameplay"" about the depth in the game design the designers created with very well thought out complimentary systems beyond the gunplay.  In fact it's a really good discussion to have, as there is a good chance many designers haven't thought that hard about just how well designed and tuned the game was for being so early in the modern FPS genre (heck a lot of your audience likely wasn't practicing game design professionally when Quake was released), and it helps identify what a crucial role good game design/designers play in making good games (while remaining invisible / non-intrusive to the user).  

If you were to skip the first half where you are attempting to say the game isn't a shooter and that shooting doesn't matter (because it does) and instead spent that time with having the straightforward discussion about why a game like Quake has a lot more depth than most might realize and point out how shooting alone isn't what makes the game compelling at many levels of play, you likely would end up with a much sharper/clearer/cogent point.  

No need to lean on false sensationalism or bombastic editorialization that journalism as a whole (let alone game journalism) is suffering from. You can still make the same great points and start the same discussion without clouding the message. 

You have good content in this (and the others videos I've seen from you thus far) and you are finding your audience.  I've seen your other videos popping up repeatedly on my social media outlets from other developers. 

I really don't think you need to lean on sensationalism or false controversy to get your audience to tune in (they are already doing so...  it's just not a HUGE audience to begin with), you just risk cheapening your message and brand for the same result.  We are a naturally inquisitive bunch who appreciate and consume good content.

2. Loot everything. If you see boxes, open them! Kill something! Loot them! Not sure if you are familiar with repairing yet, its always usefull to invest into it. If you repair equip it saves you weight and they will get more value. I often collect everything that has 0 weight as you can easily carry it. Stuff you don't use like flamer fuel or energy (if you dont use these weapons) you can sell for some nice caps. 

3. Don't waste ammo. If you see a molerat or something, you should not waste precious ammo on it unless you have enough. You can use a melee weapon for example, even if you don't have its stats boosted it can easily kill weaker enemies.

4. Gather map locations, once they are register on your map you can fast travel back to it. Use this to restock.

I'm 22, recently moved from Seattle to LA. No experience with girls in my life. Never kissed, never done anything. No girlfriends.

I got Tinder when I moved out here and my confidence was immediately boosted. There are girls who actually find me attractive? It was awesome.

I matched up with one girl, and we started talking. She was cute, I could definitely go for her. After a couple days, we started talking on the phone, and we made plans for her to come over to my place. Also, at this point we'd talked about a lot and she knew that I had no experience. She is 21, and told me that she's never had a boyfriend.

She came over and I had never been more nervous in my life, but I manned up. Can't back out now.

We sat on the couch, and I put a movie on: ""We're the Millers."" The movie title isn't really relevant, but it helps set the stage.

After a few minutes of me nervously trying to make small talk, she said ""I can tell how tense you are."" I got flustered, and said something along the lines of ""...yeah..""

She then said ""do you just want to get it over with?"" (remember, she knew that I had no experience with girls, no kiss, nothing.)

I said ""...yeah.""

She then proceeded to move over to me and get on top of me, straddling me. Then, it happened. My first kiss. Holy shit. The feeling of her lips on mine was amazing. We made out (read: I was trying to keep up, she was obviously very experienced at making out) for 30 minutes or so and then she paused.  She then said ""are you ready for this?"" and began to take off her shirt. My internal thought: WHAT THE FUCK MAN THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER.

She took off her shirt and her bra .... and I got to touch boobs for the first time. (""No longer just bags of sand, eh?"" said one of my friends when I recollected this story to him.) They were so warm. Unbelievable. It's like everything made sense and all was at peace, all at once.

We continued to make out until the movie was over. Then, we went to my bathroom and she pulled out her hair straightener because we'd discussed straightening my beard. My beard is curly so I wanted to try it.

I was sitting on the toilet and she was on her knees in front of me. Romantic, right? Anyways, as she's straightening my beard, her face gets closer and closer to mine. Eventually, we both know whats about to happen and she sets down the straightener on the counter and we begin making out again. God damn this day is amazing.

We made out for another few minutes until my roommate came home, and then she left shortly after that. 

A week or so later, she came over again and we cooked dinner together and watched Game of Thrones.

Unfortunately after that we decided to end it for other reasons. 

I'm thankful for the experience 100%. Often times you hear about people's first kisses, and they're always super nervous and their first experiences aren't that great. Mine? My first experience was amazing, and I'll always be thankful for that.

My LGS gave me a couple of those sample decks, and he told me he might be able to give me a couple more from M15! He also said hes happy for me to dig through the boxes of commons and take what ever I want, but since I didnt play before Theros I feel kinda shell shocked at what is available. My LGS is pretty friendly to children and new players, with many of the good guy gregs floating around (one kid pulled Xenagos in THSTHSTHS draft, and was going to play with it sleeved, but a regular bough him a pack of sleeves for his deck).

My school tends to have a blanket ""no hip/cool collectable anythings allowed"" so number one rule for the club is that they cannot bring their own cards to school.

I am interested in the cube side of things; though I am uncertain how much of my own time would go into maintaining it? I once made some fake boosters from my Theros cards to teach my friends how to draft, and that took a crazy amount of time. As teaching is secretly a pretty full on job, I am not sure how much of my own time Ill have available for my pet club outside of my other responsibilities.

Leveling up to 30 takes long enough, and even then, you'll only have enough IP for some very basic runes. Grinding out proper runes will take a considerable amount of time, unless you're buying RP and boosts. (first win of the day is your friend). Also, remember that you need 16 champs before you can play ranked, so you'll probably get the Champions Bundle for 3410 RP, which is €20, or the Digital Collector's Pack for 2520 RP.

Once you have a smurf it's a relaxing way to play new champs and to get a good assessment of your strength on them in a ranked environment. 

Also, hitting losing streaks isn't as bad because you can always bounce over to your other account. So that can provide some perspective. 

I think, however, that you will find that your smurf will quickly be at a very similar ranking as your main, which will kind of defeat the purpose. But, as long as you keep it as a casual ranked account it won't matter if you play new champs on it even if it is Diamond 5. 

So, if you're considering making a smurf my advice would be:

1. Start as soon as possible, collect every first win of the day. 
1. Up to level 12 or so playing vs beginner bots gives full XP/IP, and up to level 20 or so vs advanced bots. Wins give more XP/IP, and since bots are guaranteed wins I'd play vs them as long as possible.
1. Don't rage. It's your relaxed smurf and you're playing with lower rated and beginning players, so give them someone to look up to and set a great example.

a) yes definitely. but mostly to farm candies. At this cps you can sit for a long time and get more rc, but you will still see the minimal increase in total cps.

B) like they said, vortex is definitely worth it, but not yet. You can put your spare cookies into it before prestige but once you feel like your barely making a dent in in it, leave it. Holding your finger on the vortex, as well as selling buildings before hand takes a lot of (semi) active time which you could be farming candies.  

C) Yes and you are right. Since, for example, it takes more cookies to get from 1million to 1,000,001 than it does from 10 to 11, you should not spend RC until you will not ""lose"" any upon prestige. as joe mentioned, use xplitters calculator to see how many you need before buying the 4d printers and keep at 5m

d) again, as joe and pop mention, farm candy. If I know I have 5 minutes or so to play, I prestige (regardless of my RC and my prestige RC) and I swipe once, buy structures until I get to about 1quad (i also buy the cps boost and UE upgrades in there) then buy the swirl, square, and pepermint cookies, auto collector until max, screen wipe and variety until I cant afford, then fast max and cookie value upgrades until I cannot afford. Let the game collect for me for a minute or two, spend more on high end buildings and their upgrades and then wait. Once I get to level 20, if I know I have another 5 minutes or so, i prestige. if not i let it idle collecting cookies until I do.

The reason I buy as many structures and the other ""cps but not collecting cookie"" upgrades as I can is because I get some RC while getting candy. Probably my favorite part of xplitters calculator is the ""time to gain xx% from RC"" This shows (without all the math) that farming candies is so much more efficient than just farming RC once you get to a certain point of RC. I recently restarted completely and at the moment, 193% from rc = 1% from supers. 193% takes 3 hours whereas I can get 1% from candies in 20 minutes or so",5,andyh222,True,t3_2a1wp1,0,cir42x8,0,1434600474,

They are banking on enough people spending the money out of fear their console *might* break and knowing that they will profit by not having to repair nearly that amount of consoles. Otherwise, post-warranty repairs would only be $55. It's a scam because you are highly unlikely to ever use it - gambling $55 that you *will* need Sony to repair the console after the first 12-15 months is far more foolish than gambling $350 that you *won't.* Product insurance is, statistically, always a bad investment for the consumer, and if it wasn't, they wouldn't offer it.

[Extended Warranties: Should You Take The Bait?](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/warranties.asp)
&gt; What this means is that for every dollar you spend on an extended warranty from a retailer, $0.70 goes to the retailer, with the remaining $0.30 going to the insurance company. Because the insurance company also expects to profit from the agreement, it is clear that it doesn't expect to have to make very many payouts. In fact, when Consumer Reports conducted a survey of 38,000 consumers in 2000, it found that only 8% of camcorders, stove ranges, dishwashers and refrigerators were repaired within the first three years of when they were purchased. Because these warranties cost almost nothing to market and often go uncollected, they are a simple way for retailers to boost their bottom lines.

""We did frickin' fine in Episode 2, I'm hope I don't jinx myself, but I'm hoping to do just as good in the next one."" Gold and gold everywhere for Anderz. ""Holy Mamoley."" And then we get even more gold, and Anderz bursts into giggles. ""This is just too good to be true!"" Anderz has weather off, so we don't hear the booming thunder. Anderz doesn't immediately believe Generik's /me and sees that several people are falling ahead and behind the back. ""Again, I have more gold than I have apples!"" Season 6 all over again. A Skeleton shoots Anderz from far away to .5. He finds more gold to make up for it though. There's two apples in Anderz's inventory and the gold for four apples. ""I'm sorry if I'm sounding very smug here...but things are coming up Anderz."" They sure are. There are mob noises, but it's no issue for Anderz. With only two string, there's not much Anderz can do as far as range. Like he uses a bow anyways. He completely misses Millbee's death but sees him leaving. ""Maybe some technical difficulties for him, not sure why."" Anderz wonders if he should go to the Nether and immediately decides to do so. ""I've never gone to the Nether in a UHC before."" You were there with Team Potty Mouths in Season 9. Anderz heads in, hoping no one else had been there. He emerges at a different location than Pakratt's portal. He sees a Fortress immediately and heads right in, and finds a Blaze Spawner. A Blaze lights him on fire, and an apple heals Anderz to 9. Lag comes and the game freaks, and Anderz gets Blaze damage to 7.5 and heals to 9.5. Another Blaze and he's at 8.5. Anderz gets two Blaze Rods and bails at 8.5. Entirely reckless, but the Absorption covered him. Now Anderz searches for Nether Wart and gets it.

**GenerikB** *Current Losing Player*

Genny's title is 'LOL Weather Volume Slider' which is pretty funny. Generik's inventory is the worst inventory I think I have ever seen in UHC. I don't even understand. Rain starts and it's already pretty loud for the hermit. Generik sees Anderz is a sheater and types in the /me command. ""That'll get some stupids."" So far confirmed stupid: Seth, MC, Pakratt. Generik finds another cave as the thunder booms, and it sounds nice because he's right under the surface so the rain is also picking up on sounds. There's Zombies everywhere (it's actually a Zombie Spawner), and a Baby Zombie runs up on Generik and #reks him to 4.5. There's not even a chest for Generik. He pokes his head out and gets it shot off to four hearts. Outside a Zombie hits him to 3 hearts and lightning strikes and a Spiders rush up on Generik. He's at 1.5. Two Zombies and Generik is at one lonely heart. Millbee is blown up by a Creeper and Generik takes refuge in his tree. ""This friggin stuff man!"" With one heart, Generik makes a bow and makes a run back to the cave. ""We can turn this around, believe or not. You think we can't, but we absolutely can. We for sure can."" Generik tries to clear his inventory but the stuff keeps coming back. Generik turns them off and it's over. Staircasing down, Generik gets five gold. ""At this point: anybody's game!"" Uh-huh. Digging down, Generik says this is why Millbee died first in Captive Minecraft II. There's mobs everything, and Generik is two taps from following Millbee. Sunshine returns and Generik starts looking for Swampples. ""I don't care if people know I'm here, I hope they do and are afraid. Very afraid."" I don't see Generik surviving Episode 4.

**Arkas**

After six hours, we are back at the recap train with Arkas. I'm sorry these have taken a bit, but I'm quite busy and there's just so many videos. Arkas is jelly of other's Diamonds, and sees a Creeper. ""You Wot M8?"" Creeper starts to blow up and Arkas freaks out, and kills it. The thunder happens and Arkas says his ears are getting pounded, but it was way louder in other videos. Arkas calls out Anderz for sheating and is not fooled by Generik. ""He just messin'."" Arkas finds an Abandoned Mineshaft and Melon Seeds, which will be critical as it seems there's no jungle on this map. Arkas just can't even as far as the thunder is concerned. Arkas finds Emeralds but there are monsters. ""Fuck me man, do you want me to get a heart attack or something game?"" Millbee dies and Arkas goes ""oh no, Millbee! Baaaaaahhhh! Death by Creeper, the worst, the worst there is."" No experience here. Arkas starts World Cup talk but it goes nowhere. A Skeleton menaces Arkas and he becomes the third guy after Kurt and Nebris to take a hit and have armor absorb it. Still at 10. To make up for it, another guy shoots him to 9 in one hit. ""You fucking kidding me? I'm done with this cave."" Arkas heads back into a nearby Taiga and sees cobble pillars. They're Beef's from Episode 2. Arkas finds a Ravine and knocks a Millbee in. Anderz gets a Blaze Rod as Arkas sees a Skeleton below. ""Kill the Swede!"" 

**SethBling**

Skipped Seth, sorry Seth. Let's see what he's doing to match the pace set by Anderz. Seth's goal is to get the string for the bow before he heads to the surface. Seth has decided on Diamond Armor instead of a sword as they are the same melee but armor has a boost in the ranged. The ThunderPocalypse starts as Seth finds some gold pieces. ""I can't, what is with this thunder. Is this a bukkit thing?"" Maybe, Season 8 was on bukkit and had similar thunder craziness. ""Oh my goodness...the B-Team betrayal. Damn. GG. That's the first death of UHC 17."" Seth finds a bunch of Diamonds and Guude tells him it was a /me. ""Well then. Well then. I got fooled."" Seth gets some string and has a bow now, something Justis League didn't have in Season 16 until they took out Parents (with Seth dying). Power I bow for Seth, and he quickly suggests clearing if all twenty people agreed. Seth turns weather to 39% and starts getting flint, he's excited now. Seth's playing one of the cleanest games I've ever seen. Millbee is blown up and Seth sees the '19 players remain' part of the plug-in he wrote. It's really embarrassing the /me got him as it was missing his own plug-in marker. I'm really liking Seth's commentary, you're doing a great job in your style. The storm ends and Seth heads top side, taking a Diamond Sword anyway. Baby Zombies try to impeded Seth's staircase, and a Skeleton drops in on Seth as he reaches the surface. Like Kurt, Nebris, and Arkas, his armor absorbs a blow. He hears water being poured on obsidian and footsteps. ""There can't be a person."" It might've been rain on a lava lake. Seth figures it out. A Baby Zombie is still on the surface. Seth sees that Anderz has a Blaze Rod and is already thinking that range will be better in a fight against him or it'll be BTC v Etho over again. Seth digs up and #reks a Baby Zombie.

**Vechs**

With pretty much no resources, Vechs gets an iron chestplate together and pants along with a bucket. Just as Vechs heads onto the surface, the thunderstorm starts as Vechs wonders if mobs can spawn in the storm. Vechs feels cold IRL and is excited but skeptical of Generik's 'death'. Vechs sees a Creeper on the surface and a Zombie starts warping to him and he's at 8.5. Vechs sees a cave and a Spider in front of it and gets two string, and decides to hunt for another spider. Lightning strikes six blocks away from Vechs. Not as close as it being one-two blocks from Just-Defy in Season 7. Vechs sees a Village in the distance and changes the plan to a Village raid. A Spider warps to Vechs and he has the string for a bow and is at 7. The Village has nothing of use, it's been seen by many a player. I'd be interested in seeing the Overview. Just as Generik made the church here his home, Vechs makes a home his home. Vechs makes a real bow, and this kind of Village sheltering was last done by the BAND in Season 13 I think. Might be wrong as I missed some of Season 14. Vechs says the lag is fair as everyone is suffering, but that's not true. Vechs' three hearts of damage have been bullshit. Vechs goes out to get crops and flees as a Creeper tracks him and lightning crashes. ""This feels like my first month of Minecraft."" Carrots are not cookable to Vechs' great shock. Grilled carrots? It's from his Don't Starve experience Vechs says. Vechs wonders about how he should gauge his performance, and there other metrics than winning to a 'good' season. Vechs then trolls Aureylian.

**Aureylian**

With Aurey being very adamant about her UHC skills, I have developed a feeling. My gut says that Aureylian will get 2nd. She is deep in a cave trying to get materials and finding bupkis. Full Iron though. Thunder starts and Aureylian is back on dat grind. Aurey feels sad that she completely missed Generik being slain by Bdubs, looking at the chat to see it, totally missing the /me. There's really not much to talk about, thunder cave, now has a bow and an iron sword, and Aureylian caving at 6.5. She shoots a Skeleton, ""suck it!"" Millbee dies and Aureylian is sad, not even realizing that Generik still lives. There's some gold that she is going to attempt to get it. Potentially maybe. ""This is like the worst storm in UHC history, what the heck is going on?"" Aureylian's first solo UHC is going well. A Spider jumps on Aureylian. ""What the Fu---there were a lot of profane words almost screamed right now--hell no I'm not going that way--hell no, no, no. The hell."" Aureylian's at 6. Another Spider of crazy and she's at 5.5. There's a Skeleton right near Aurey that she hits into lava. ""Why, oh God, I hate this game, WHY!"" There are Zombies all around Aureylian and she kills them all, and is at 5.5. More gold. Aureylian tells the guys that she's going to stay in her cave for lols, and goes ""oh God"" at the mention of the Spider Mic by Vechs.

**Sevadus**

Last one for the night, I'll get the non-Mindcrackers tomorrow. Now with six Diamonds, Sevadus is 'feeling like a boss'. He is quite happy but realizes that he needs a book from 'upstairs'. Sevadus is thinking about the Nether for Strength Potions, but doesn't know if it's worth the risk. The thunder starts. ""Oh jeez, it's raining outside, or somebody died."" The thunder is just so crazy. ""GENERIKB WAS SLAIN BY BDOUBLEO, AND THERE IT IS. RIP. RIP. RIP. Is that B-Team, oh my gosh?"" And another one in the fools category. ""He killed him in the middle of a storm, how freaking epic, seriously."" MC actually killed Mhykol on the surface during a thunderstorm in Season 8. Sevadus mines a block above him to move in a cave and two Diamonds show up. ""Oh my God! Jesus! That is awesome!"" Sevadus now has five Diamonds. ""I'm looking for Diamonds, I'm looking for the win, I'm looking to destroy."" Taking a look at TAB, Sevadus has a confidence boost. Sevadus mines some iron for kicks and breaks into a massive gold vein. Millbee gets blown up by a Creeper. ""Oh no! MILLBEE! GG to Millbee. G-G to Mill-Bee."" Sevadus says these words: ""I have no idea what the fuck I am doing."" And gets shot by a Skeleton to 7 instantly. Another ceiling glance, five more gold. Another Skeleton hits Sevadus to 6 and he says that now is not the time to surface. Sevadus just can't quit caving as Diamonds are on his mind. BlingBling. More cave exploration, more Gary Coleman avoidance. He makes one fall in lava and the jazzing outro happens.

**Coestar**

Alright, these recaps have taken some time, but I'm staying true to my personal goal that if I start an episode's recaps I finish them before the next episode's release. Coe kills a Creeper and continues to explore at 3 hearts. A storm begins and Coe remembers his poor carrot he planted. ""Holy frickin' crap."" The thunder is real for Coe, and he just turns it off. Coe sees chat freaking out and reads that Generik was pulling a fake-out, and chuckles. There's some block repop for Coe but it doesn't do damage like it did to BTC. The cave just is ending with gold and Diamonds for Coe. ""Oh shiiii,"" is Coe's response to Millbee death. ""Please don't let that happen to me."" Coe kills a Skeleton and man is he nervous and a lightning strike goes off. ""Oh shit."" ""Any encounter with anybody right now is not going to be good for me."" Staircasing leads to a pick breaking for Coe and reaching Bedrock. But there's a Spider tracking him, so Coe goes on the sound hunt. It's a dead end where the Spider was, but there's some gold for Coe. Coe falls a bat's squeaks to a massive ravine. ""The worst thing that could happen here is for something to drop on me.""

**Captain Sparklez**

Captain Sparklez is jazzed that he has made it two episodes and is hoping that the Witch has been dealt with. He has no armor at all, but has been doing well. The thunderstorm begins, and Captain Sparklez correctly calls out that mobs will spawn topside. Captain Sparklez checks TAB and says that it's pretty rough for Pakratt at half-a-heart. He's collecting the torches he's placed, that doesn't seem like the best plan, but okay. Captain Sparklez sees the people doing better than him and marks them as 'do not mess with'. After missing all the Generik flimflammery, Captain Sparklez takes Nebris' bed comment seriously and replies in chat as such. Wondering about UHC strats, Captain Sparklez gets sniped to 8 by a Skeleton as he GG's Millbee. Now with actual armor, Captain Sparklez is much better equipped even though he's running low on cave. Captain Sparklez heads to the surface and a Skeleton shoots him in the back to 7.5. ""Honestly I'm probably just going to die to mobs. Shouldn't have gone above ground."" Captain Sparklez wanders on a Village that I think Baj found. ""Hello Mr. Testificate."" Testificate, now that's a name I haven't heard in a long time. There's a nearby cave opening and he goes 'Hello, housekeeping'. Where's that from? I've heard Kurt say that too. The storm stops and Captain Sparklez can wander around in peace. ""What a day."" Seeing the 'Into Fire', Captain Sparklez says ""RIP to my hopes and dreams, we do have to kill him but I'm not sure we'll be able to."" Melons are growing.

I think I'd call this build ""The Range Control"" build, as you can move the mobs around (desync permitting) to where one prefers. 

I'm using dual cybil's paw because every mod on it stacks. Also taking the 15% block from dual wield and duel wield block passives from tree. My lvl [85 full tree will probably look like this.](http://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-tree/AAAAAgAAAuMFLQdjB6UIZwj0DlwQdBEtFSAYPBjbGYUabB7fIWAhwySqKNso-ipNLJws6S0fMYg0kzbpOrM9Xz8nQKBEq0V-RZ1Jskp9SshOKk9WUlNVrlXGVytX4VpSW69gS2NwZ6BnvWwWbRlzU3TtdPF5A3qqeu98g4IQgh6Cx4PbhTKHdo6-j0aPppAKkNaTOpeVl_Sa4Jtdm6Gdrp65pwiomrM_tkG31riTvSe-vMBUwfPN-s5xz2XQ0NsL3Q3fsN_v42rr7u5v707v4_KX89306fll-ej8S_zF)

With this tree and dual cybil's paw I get:

1. 206% Max Life
1. MoM
1. EB for AA
1. 20% Increased AOE
1. 37% Increased Cast Speed (21 from tree, 16 from cybil's paw)
1. 24% Increased Projectile Damage (it changes tooltip DPS, so I assume it actually does work)
1. 39% Block chance (15% from duel wield+24% from tree)
1. 206% Increased Spell Damage (88% Spell Damage from tree, 24% projectile from tree, 94% from Cybils Paw)

The links I'm currently using are BL+Echo+Faster Casting+Added Chaos+Q20Knockback.

The added chaos is about a 30% flat boost to DPS. It's the same damage per level as BL with 30% effectiveness. 

I'm using Projectile weakness for added knockback chance and the 30% more multiplier that works for lightning and chaos damage.

I'm using a frost wall totem for extra mob control when things get sketchy. BL passes through frost wall, so I can keep mobs back and still hit them. Whirling blades allows me to get out if I get walled in.

[Here is what it looks like with level 13 gems.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrrjbdTGwoA) 

I'm hoping with properly leveled gems this will be able to do enough damage to be passible in maps. 

The biggest weakness I'm finding right now is lack of single target DPS.

Edit: I forgot to mention that I found LMP/GMP to be very sub optimal with BL. You are much better off with increased AOE. ",6,chfhimself,True,t3_2a1xys,0,ciqxr5z,0,1434597632,

Both of these melees are exceptionally amazing. They aren't a crutch, and can tailor to your type of gameplay. Let's look at the powerjack.
This is an ambush type weapon. See a medic away from his team? Quickly rush there and take him down. Player with low health going to find a medkit? Intercept him. He's dead. The health boost means you can go back into battle healthier. It also has the perk of making you go faster, which is suburb for any class. What this meele lacks is damage. Why would I try and go into close quarters with someone and try and hit them with my powerjack, when my flamethrower will do the job quicker? So it's only useful against unaware players. This is we people only use the powejack for the speed boost

The homewrecker is a defensive meele. Every defending team has a sentry nest somewhere. You can help engineers de-sap their sentries while they are afk or collecting metal. Spies while often not even bother trying to deal with a homewrecker pyro camping a sentry. Unfortunately, that is where our problem lays. Camping. Pyro is built for, well, not camping. Pyros are easily dealt with if they are expected of. That's why ambush tactics work really well. The homewrecker turns you into a baby sitter. Camping at a sentry. The only offensive aspect of it is the 100% damage dealt to sentries. This is helpful against mini sentries. And that's it. Pyros will never be able to get on a level 2 - 3 sentry without dying.

My final choice is....
The power jack! This weapon is excel for ambush pyros and for getting to point a to point b faster. 
The homewrecker lacks a, offensive aspect for me, and although engineers will praise their flaming satan, rainbow loving god, it's boring to babysit sentries. If it had a notification icon when a building is sapped, it'd would of won. 
P.S Soz I can't bold the power jack, I'm on an iPad
P.P.S iPads take forever to write with.

Other profitable missions early game are caravan escort (these give a TON of exp, not quite as much cash, but that much exp I consider profitable especially for the effort) and rescue a kidnapped girl (if you keep all the money and wipe out the bandits) for the guildmasters.

start out as a cleric (sl2 and starts with 14 faith) which is what you're going to mostly be focusing on (faith) beat asylum demon, go collect souls from firelink/valley of drakes/new londo, get the firekeepers soul from new londo ruins, bone or suicide, get enchanted set from blighttown, bone or suicide DONT get the firekeeper soul in blighttown now as it will make lautrec flee his prison and you'll come back to a dead firekeeper and an eye of death. 

from here consume all yr souls and use them to get at least 12 str and 12 dex (you'll need it for sunlight straight sword) then go beat taurus, grab soapstone and then kill solaire for his gear. save all souls you can and upgrade his sword and armor as early as possible you may need to farm some darkwraiths in new londo depending on how early you want to be OP. it may also be wise to split souls between upgrades and lvling faith (you'll need at least 30 fai to wield great ligtning spear). 

once you beat taurus or gargoyles, spend some time there helping people to be able to join the sunbros (you only need to help with 2 successful fights for the faith requirement to be lowed to 15 which is just one point away from your starting faith) after joining the sunbros i would again help people to get souls and collect sunlight medals for great lightning spear. i would also level attunenment a bit to have at least 3 slots; heal, lightning spear, great lightning spear.

From their it's really up to you. i would probably try to get the ring of the suns firstborn as soon as possible to boost miracles. if you follow seigmeyers quest you can get emit force, and you can also visit rhea in totg after she appears in firelink (catacombs ins't too hard if you upgrade the sunlight straight sword into a divine weapon which is fairly easy to do early on) save her then visit her in the parish for wotg.

We were also projecting significant civilian resistance for a variety of reasons, which also would have led to a very, very high casualty rate for both Japanese civilians and Allied soldiers.

In short, it would have been an absolute bloodbath on both sides.

Specific advice for your ship:

* Plan to only return your capsule and possibly science payload.  You can actually EVA and collect the science from instruments to bring it back to your pod, if you want.
* The lander has too many landing legs.  3-4 are fine for most lower gravity moons.
* As /u/threep03k64 pointed out, the LV-909 engines are way overkill.  They weigh 0.5 tons each, which is a lot for a light lander.  The 48-7S is an awesome choice if you want more thrust, and they weigh only 0.1 tons each.
* Make the lander so that it decouples the side tanks for the return stage (with fuel lines to keep the center tank full).  This will drop a lot of unnecessary weight.  I am assuming you have an engine under the center stack.
* It looks like you have the skipper engine unlocked.  You can probably use a bigger booster on your first stage.  The larger fuel tanks and higher thrust will make it easier to get delta-v and thrust.
* I can't quite tell what engines you have on the booster, but you probably only need one LV-T45 for its gimalling for control.  The other engines can be LV-T30s for the better trust and TWR.",3,Jim3535,True,t3_2a08y3,0,ciqfl4n,0,1434588763,

What is the event?

The pre-release event is a sealed Swiss format tournament. You will choose a colour and be given a package that is slightly seeded to that colour. In the pack, you will receive an promo card (according to your colour) that you can play in your deck, a spin-down d20 dice to record life, three Theros booster packs, two BotG booster packs and one semi-randomized BotG booster pack that tries to stay within your chosen colour. Out of these pool of cards you create a 40 card deck and play (usually 4) rounds against others. If you are new and that scares you, do not worry! Pre-releases, like FNM, are very new user friendly.

What should i bring?

Although many people will give you different answers to this question, here is the Taylorleb Pre-Release Camping kit:

17 of each basic land: Although you can get basic land from your Local Game Store (LGS), do you really want to be running around collecting land during your precious deck building time?  Something to record life totals: One D20 already comes in your pre-release kit, and i would suggest bringing one to record your opponents life as well.  An alternative to dice that i would suggest is Pen and Paper. With paper you can view the history of the game as well as record hands if any are revealed. Sleeves: You want to keep that Kiora you cracked nice and safe when playing, so $4 draft sleeves are a great investment! Playmat!!!!! I cannot stress this enough! Usually pre-releases are a lot busier then other MTG events and a LGS will have to put out a lot of tables (almost always dirty). You do not want to ruin your new sleeves and/or cards you just got!  Snacks! Everyone gets hungry, and these events can last up to 4+ hours. Do you really want to have to run down to a hot dog stand during the event and risk missing a game? Trade Binder: Pre-Releases are a great opportunity to trade for those cards you are looking for! Just be careful with your stuff and never leave it unattended! Do not bring your ""pimp"" binder as there will be a lot of people that are not commons at your LGS.  

How should i prepare?

A lot of people laugh when people ""prepare"" for a pre-release event, but it is very important! I would suggest lots of sleep the day before (especially if going to the midnight release). Do not stuff yourself with greasy food right before you play. Believe it or not this actually slows down your brain because it is tying to focus on processing the shit you just put into your body. One of the most important things I do before a pre-release is study! Even if you are not a 'hardcore' player, you still do not want to have to spend 10 minutes of a match looking at what mechanics do. If you do not keep up with spoilers, I would suggest checking out the Magic: The Gathering facebook page the day before the event. They post all of the cards on there, just do a quick little run through of the cards! 

So there you have it, Taylorleb's guide to a pre-release. I would love to hear if people have anything to add onto what i have said! I hope this helped!!!",1,xxtayxx,True,t3_29yj9z,0,cipujm6,0,1434578748,

The land that is currently considered Israel was part of the Ottoman Empire and therefore Muslim, leading into World War I. My history here is a little hazy, but between WW I and WW II, Muslims generally lost control of their land and it was essentially carved up by the West. (I'm leaving it hazy here; I thought the Ottoman Empire lasted until WW II and sided with Hitler, after which point the British carved them up, but a quick Wiki search shows the Ottoman Empire ended in the early 1920s, which would be after WW I).

In any case, the Middle East was carved up by Western forces along what is essentially arbitrary lines and grouped religiously-opposing cultures with each other. This is essentially the problem in Iraq, religiously opposing Shiites and Sunnies are fighting for dominance, when they could just be separate countries.

In any case, Jewish forces began populating the Holy Land. The ultimate plan is to purchase the Holy Land (and force out previous owners), lot by lot. This has been going on since before WW I, but received a large boost after WW II. It was at this point that the United Nations recognized Israel as a nation. Keep in mind that Israel was only able to form by collecting land in the region from previous inhabitants.

As the Arab nations began to understand what was going on, they began to mount an offensive against the growing Jewish State. This led to multiple wars in the later half of the 20th century, in which Israel kicked the crap out of their opponents (using US hardware) and expanded their land ownership.

This led to the Palestinian welfare state and refuge camps. I'm happy to lay blame on both sides and point out that no other Arab nation would take the refuges, instead preferring to leverage the lives of the displaced Palestinians as collateral against Israel.

Meanwhile, Israel has shown no remorse in encroaching on and killing the Palestinian populace.

I used to be US-conservative and support Israel. Then I did research.

The closest the 2 sides came to peace was in the mid-90s, when Israel was under the guidance of Yitzhak Rabin, who won the Nobel Prize for Peace for his efforts in guiding Israel and Palestine to peace. He was then assassinated by a right-wing Israeli radical that opposed the peace discussions.

Israel and Palestine never really seemed destined for peace after that, with Yasser Arafet constantly fighting with Israel, and ongoing suicide bombings into Israel under his watch. He eventually died in 2004, with ongoing speculation/claims that Israel assassinated him. As near as I can tell, despite ongoing suspicion, nothing has been proven.

What truly led me to lose any confidence in Israel's interest or commitment in peace was their ongoing settlements. Part of every peace discussion has been a stop to ongoing Israel settlements, which are the core of Zionism expansion. Israel will make motions for peace diplomatically, while they continue settlements into Palestinian land. This includes indirect aggression against Palestinians, as well as direct violence against Palestinians.

Despite any global or diplomatic gestures, the reality of Jewish Settlements eternally continuing to expand in Palestinian lands reveals the true intent of the Israeli state. There is no peace plan, only expulsion of the Palestinian people.

Note that I have nothing against Jewish people in general, including the majority of the people living in Israel. My condemnation is targeted directly at the right-wing leadership of Israel and the citizenry that feels expansion of Israeli Settlements, at the expense of the Palestinian people, is okay.",9,tripperda,True,t3_29x2a0,0,cippv6q,0,1434576002,

They are over priced and as you get into the game you can easily just build a weapon and rush it, buy the slots if needed, buy the catalyst if needed, and end with 1 extra slot at a cheaper price even if you needed to pay for the slot and catalyst. get access to dark sectors, buy a resource booster so you get double resources (or a resource drop booster that boosts resource drop rates for everyone. not sure which is more effective) and just spend some time collecting all sorts of resources to use for guns. I only suggest buying these things if you are REALLY pressed for time and have money to spare. 

Also titan extractors are VERY handy. make a few and deploy them to a planet that has resources you need. if it's injured you take it back then deploy another that has full HP while the injured one heals. the higher your mastery rank is the more you can deploy. They get a good amount of resources for what they are and have allowed me to stock of on things I normally don't farm for.

I personally dislike all the frames you mentioned but that's just an opinion so I think I'll just name their uses and you can decide for yourself if the greater detail helped.

Ash - he's part stealth part offense. His shuriken does decent damage for a 1 skill, can hit 2 separate enemies while inflicting bleed proc on them 100% of the time, and it's silent.

Smoke bomb is what you'll probably be using most. Invisibility is basically invincibility now since the enemy ignores you completely on top of smoke bomb having a small stun for meleeing enemies. As of late however the enemies somewhat get alerted to you when you fire. Mostly it's just them walking to where you fired and this can be remedied with a silent gun or silence mod. It also amplifies melee damage by 4x but if you come in contact with them or fire near them they become alert and the effect is useless.

Teleport leaves enemies open to finishers so you can go in, do a finisher and deal some heavy damage. Nothing much to say.

Blade storm is very powerful since it now quickly hits many enemies in rapid succession while leaving you completely invulnerable why you teleport around and stab people. Does good damage and always procs bleed. 

Nyx - probably the epitome of crowd control for range enemies. Mind control is handy sometimes but more often than not it's useless. it controls 1 enemy who becomes an ally of the tenno and sometimes their auxiliary effects rub off onto you if they have one (i.e. ancient healers heal you instead and shield drones buff your shield).

Psychic bolts is just disappointing. they collide with so many obstacles and deal not very good damage. 

Chaos is arguably her most important ability and what got her labeled as a 1 trick pony for quite some time. It basically makes everyone in the radius of the cast turn on each other and attack anything and unlike mind control it includes you. The reason to use this over mind control is mind control can only do 1 target. this affects every one in the radius. Very handy.

Absorb became useful as of late. It's a skill that makes you invincible and unable to move but every shot from either enemy or team mate adds damage to the end of the attack which explodes outwards. With range mods you can cover objectives with ease but at the cost of it consuming energy per second. Unlike most skills this one is toggleable meaning you can toggle it on or off and instead of using all energy at once it uses energy per second until it gets canceled.

Frost - more or less a 1 trick pony still. His freeze attack is just to remove high level enemies from battle but with the massive amount of AoE's they will always get hit and break free quickly. 

ice wave is a good damage ability. That's all I can say really. It hurts things in a line well enough.

Snow globe is his best skill. It blocks all damage in a certain area. For a few seconds when cast it abosrbs all damage and that damage gets added onto it's health as well as your armor being added onto the health of the globe. Very useful for corpus and grineer defense missions but don't use it on infested. they don't use guns and no one likes it.

Avalanche is a decent skill. I can't say much outside of it does nice damage and offers a bit of a stun. Don't really see many frosts use anything outside of snowglobe though.

Nekros - Not a good frame really. Handy for survival but past that I don't find any use in playing him at all. soul punch is more or less just a stunning move. It deals OK damage but it's hardly anything you'd want to use.

Terrify is more handy for reviving and such since enemies just flee constantly.

Desecrate is where it's at. You have a nekros for ANY farming mission and survival and you will be swimming in life support, resources, and sometimes mods. 

Shadows of the dead is decent skill. Feels more like a multi target mind control if anything. It takes the last few things you killed and summons them. this includes eximus types and all. To properly use it you have to pick and choose who you kill which can get annoying because you can't kill anything but the larger enemies for it be as effective as possible. Then again, you can just kill a group and have the spawns be meat shields.

Now onto weapons. I suggest trying the boltor. It's a handy puncture and travel time based rifle with all around good stats. Prime version is the most OP base damage gun in the game right now and it's not mastery locked. 

I also suggest a bow. They do really good single target damage which is great early on but I feel they fall off later on when there are tons of enemies and even the innate punch through doesn't save it. (this is an opinion. many people love bows and think they are the bestest things ever. I personally don't)

For secondaries, the kunai are great since they are 100% accurate, deal good damage, but have travel time.

By gathering herbs, purchasing minerals or skinning animals and beasts you encountered on your travels, you could collect ingredients used to produce potions.  Each ingredient would contain one of six basic substances and one of three additional substances.

Potions would require between three and five ingredients containing specific basic substances.  You would also need a base, either strong (standard quality) alcohol for potions with three ingredients, high quality alcohol for those with four, or top quality alcohol for those with five.  If you wanted, you could just drink the alcohol and get drunk, but you were better off saving them for potions.  There is also nothing stopping you from using top quality alcohol as a base for a potion requiring three ingredients.

If, when creating a potion, all your ingredients contained the same additional substance, your potion would gain an additional bonus (lower potion toxicity, higher damage output or increased vitality regeneration).  This meant that, while you might have the ingredients to craft a specific potion, you would want to save the ingredients you have as their additional substance makes them more useful in another potion, e.g. I found the Albedo additional substance was best saved for crafting Blizzard.

Albedo would reduce the toxicity of a potion; all potions have a certain level of toxicity, which would have a negative impact on the player once it reached certain thresholds, ultimately resulting in death once it reached 100.  Any toxicity gained from consuming a potion would drop to zero after an hour and, with potions lasting up to 8 hours, you could simply meditate for an hour after consuming some potions to reduce toxicity to zero, while still retaining the benefits.  Blizzard, however, lasted only 20 minutes, boosting your ability to parry and dodge.  Because toxicity lasts for 1 hour and Blizzard only lasts 20 minutes, you couldn't meditate for an hour to remove toxicity, so you couldn't consume more than two in an hour without dying.  Crafting the potion with Albedo, however, would allow you to continuously consume Blizzard every 20 minutes.

Additionally, rather than using alcohol as a base, grease or black powder could be used to craft oils that could be applied to weapons or bombs, however the additional substances in the ingredients had no effect on the resulting oils and bombs.

I had really hoped that The Witcher 2 would expand on this, building upon the mechanics involving secondary substances, but they actually simplified the crafting mechanic in the sequel.  Instead, ingredients would contain one of nine basic substances and no additional substances, and bases were removed entirely.",29,[deleted],True,t3_29wuf7,0,cipey8n,0,1434569546,

And what justifies your property ownership? Why is it yours? If you abandon it and other people take it over, when does it stop being yours? If you stamp something as your own and an entire community works on it and relies on it, what is your claim based on?

What annoys me about AnCaps is that you take property rights **for granted** as if there was an objective, immutable form of property norm that is 'natural' and exists prior to society. There is no such thing. There is no such thing as a pure ""free market"" either, as markets require an institutional framework to exist (the type of property right that is enforced for example). There is a gigantic amount of variety in property and exchange norms through human history, picking one specific type of property and saying ""This here is the *natural law!*"" is just meaningless abstraction to me. The fact you deny the very *concept* of commons (as if large communities of people can't collectively use, rely and work on a resource, like the air we all breathe) is also baffling.

&gt;And if they refuse and attempt to get in the way of my property claims, I will have them physically removed either by myself or whoever I have paid to secure my claims. I don't need a state for this. 

You are initiating force to keep people out of a resource, that seems coercive and ""statist"" to me. If we are talking about something that is based on usufruct (that is, *possession*) at least we can make sure it is defensive force (someone would have to kick you out of your house to take it over); but when speaking of natural resources/means of production with a *social* use it gets infinitely more complicated. 

If you live near a forest, rely on cutting woods in there and build a house with said woods, it makes sense for you to say the woods you use are yours and try to get people to not take down the part of the forest you rely on. If you tried to keep everyone else out of the entire forest (even if you relied on less than 1% of it) would require an initiation of force against *everyone* else. You wouldn't be justified in doing so and you wouldn't be able to do that with out a State supporting you. 

We can think of many similar scenarions involving common or yet unsettled resources: Imagine one individual owning the only water source of an entire city and making everyone pay him 10% of their income in order to have the right to drink. How is this power not authoritarian, and how would he prevent an insurrection with out employing guns to defend himself and becoming a State? There is a point where your ability to control things cease to become a guarantee of autonomy and become a power *over* the autonomy of others, *there is a point where a line needs to be drawn*. That's why we tell ""property"" and ""possession"" apart from each other.

I'm not a fan of Herbert Spencer, but he wrote a [critique of private ownership in land](http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/273#lf0331_head_023) in where he shows - in your own terms! - that self-ownership and equal rights are incompatible with private ownership in natural resources, and i think AnCaps should read it and familiarize themselves with the concepts he discusses (specially since he is one of your own). He removed this chapter from later editions of Social Statics after he became a social darwinist.

&gt;We have seen first hand how horrible people are at planning ahead.

The assumptions you people make on economics are ridiculously contradictory. ""Human action is rational and individuals search for their well-being, and thus most will do well exchanging on the market! However the masses of people are horrible at planning ahead, so an elite must plan production for them.""; ""Higher profits motivate capitalists to invest more! Rises in wages are not necessary and are even bad for workers, though.""; ""Centralization is bad. Oligopoly and gigantic wealth inequality are alright and natural if they come from the free market!"".

Giving more people power in their workplace has worked very well where tried. Kevin Carson has a pretty good section about that in ""Studies in Mutualist Political Economy"". In the Spanish Revolution when workers took over the means of production and first got self-management going they made public services much more efficient and really boosted production in Barcelona; giving the masses of people that *have daily contact with production* more autonomy to experiment and an equal voice in discissing things that matter to them is much better than letting a separated minority make all decisions - there's even a basis in [Austrian econ](http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw1.html) for that! 

&gt;Well so do many people that have good paying jobs. Many of whom could make more, but it would involve having to work harder and taking more risks or stressful positions.

Or it's because Capitalism is fundamented on ever-growing centralisation and growth of established market power, thus making any person that tries to join the ranks of small producers only fail to re-produce Capital themselves as they fail to produce at the SNLT. Established Capitalists are very secure and stress-free, it is the workers who want to become Capitalists that are risking and being stressed out. And taking upper middle class people in America as the standard, of course it looks like you have some freedom. Now tell sweatshop workers in Malasya that every one of them could just start his business. 

The thing with Capitalist social relations is that by their nature they tend to merely re-produce workers as workers, while allowing Capitalists to accumulate much more as time goes by. It is only possible for people to rise up to the ranks of Capitalists in new markets that have just opened up and do not have established Capital yet (and even then you rely on a lot of sheer luck), and the biggest capitalists only go down in periods of intense crisis (though even then they still get off *much* better than the average worker).

I also said this once and will say again, but the origin of Capitalism has very little to do with hard work, risk and saving and everything to do with the [literal seizing of commons and of individual property throug brute force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_accumulation_of_capital). 

And another thing: You seem to be under the impression that the notion profits come from unpaid labor is merely a ""moral claim"" against Capitalists. While i definitely think it is possible to make a moral claim from that, my view is that this is just an economic fact, that unpaid-labor is the only possible source of Capitalist surplus. If you want to say that the employer ""legitimately"" takes this part of this surplus because his function is necessary or whatever, believe whatever you want. As i mentioned in [my discussion with Anen-on-me](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/29l5gc/no_such_thing_as_surplus_profit_both_sides_profit/cim5ou0) the other day, it is very easy to rationalize *any* mode of production by appealing to whatever ""role"" the ruling class supposedly plays, and making a discussion about exploitation solely about moral justification for society is missing the point.

My problem with Capital is more than just moral but i also hold that Capitalist social relations face *internal contradictions* that plague it and grow with it. If profits are unpaid-labor, there is a conflict between workers and capitalists over the distribution of this surplus. If profits are unpaid-labor, then the existance of unemployment will keep profits up (and the system healthy) by making unemployment loom as a threat over workers to keep wages down. If profits are unpaid-labor and capitalists must produce under the SNLT, the [rate of profit will fall over time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendency_of_the_rate_of_profit_to_fall). You can justify unpaid labor on whatever basis you want, but economic problems are economic problems.

&gt;The ambitious people, the driven and creative people, the risk takers, these are the individuals that rise to the top and wish to separate themselves from the ones who just want to get by.

It's basically the game continuing in your absence for the rest of the ""day"" (or if you don't log in for a couple days, a couple game ""days"")

When you're playing the game, even though it's cycling through day and night, it's still technically all happening on the same day. Your daily usage of base resources don't get consumed while you are playing, even if you are going through numerous cycles of day and night (but, obviously you lose resources when you use them or certain events reduce them). Time based projects (research, commerce options, building) are based on real time (so if you begin a 2 hour research project, it'll take 2 hours to finish), however certain game features (like sick/hurt survivors having a chance to heal, vehicles getting repaired, weapons getting fixed) are based on in game cycles (things get fixed at dawn, for instance).

Once you log out and let the simulation run, it's basically finishing the rest of the ""day"". How you leave the game directly influences the simulation (and thus the next day when you log back in):

During the simulation:

--The daily usage of resources gets consumed (if you had -10 food, +3 medicine +6 ammo, -15 construction, 0 fuel), for instance, that's when your base would reflect those daily changes. If you have enough resources, you can get benefits based on how much you have (ex: medicine, snacks, etc.). If you don't have enough resources, you can have negative consequences (survivors suffering starvation if you don't have enough food, sick survivors not healing, survivors dying because from a freak attack if you don't have enough ammo, outposts not collecting resources if you don't have enough materials, etc.)

--The morale always starts at around half (but events during the simulation can affect it)

-- Any garden will give you the food it created.

--Finishes up any research or other building projects you started during the game

--Survivors officially sleep. If you have a bed for everyone, you get a 10% ""good night's sleep"" stamina bonus when you log back in. If survivors have to share beds, you don't get the bonus. If you have too many survivors (more than double the people as beds--ex: 8 beds, 20 survivors), some survivors will have a stamina penalty for sleep deprivation.

--Survivors have a chance to get healed if they are sick or injured (or worsen if you don't have a medical facility or medicine)

--Commerce options (training for +3 ammo, for instance), will finish up

--Missing survivors can die

--Events relating to your facilities can happen. If you don't have a kitchen and/or preserve food, it can sometimes go bad and get survivors sick. If you have a kitchen, sometimes you can help prevent that from happening and get morale boosts from having a tidy/clean kitchen. If you don't have a watch tower, sometimes a feral/juggernaut will get into your base and kill one of your survivors. 

--Events relating to moods. Survivors in a good mood are more likely to bring in resources they found during the simulation. Survivors in a bad mood are more likely to have fights, run away, or kill themselves. (If you have a counselor, they can help stop them from running away or killing themselves).

--Flu outbreaks can happen (Lily usually warns you during the game if it's likely to happen). If you don't have enough medical resources, a bunch of survivors can get sick.)

When you log back in after the simulation has run, you'll get a journal note saying ""Survived another day"", and then it'll have a journal note explaining the daily usage of resources. After that, you can have a couple journal events based on what I wrote above. 

If you are gone multiple days between playing, you will have multiple ""days"" be simulated. The only difference between when one event is simulated and multiple days is you have a chance for ""bonus report"", which is where if you have enough building materials, then any outpost with one resource still in the building will give you an additional bonus (if you have 4 construction outposts with a resource in each building, you can get +12 construction materials added to your supply--basically +3 of whatever resource the outpost produces).

If you are gone weeks/months/etc, the simulation will taper off after awhile so that it was more like you were only gone a week or so.

Basically, what happens during the simulation is based on how you leave the base. When I log back in, I rarely notice much has happened (or only good things have happened) because I leave it in good order.  I make sure to always have a GOOD supply of resources, no nearby infestations, all outposts set (and in a way that I usually gain most resources during the simulation), the right facilities, enough beds, high morale, everyone is in a good mood, etc.).  But if you leave the game with poor resources, or survivors in a bad mood, or inadequate facilities, or someone still missing, then you can come back and find lots of problems.

**Working A Tile**

This is basic, but just incase - so to work a tile, you need a citizen. If you click on a city you will be able to see what tiles citizens are working, as well as what yields those tiles give. You can also override and change them if for some reason you want to just by clicking on a tile in that city screen which will lock a citizen to it. Also, on the note of tiles, working a tile improves the yields on it. For example, a hill would give 2 production, but a hill with a mine would give 3. However, you only get that yield if you have a citizen on it.

**Which Characters To Use**

Honestly, play whatever appeals to you. It is possible to win any game with any civ, so just find one you like. The (arguably) strongest four, assuming you have the expansions/DLC are Poland (any playstyle/win type), Maya (when you are going wide - i.e. making A LOT of cities, which I don't recommend since I found doing that very hard when I first started, particularly in managing happiness), Babylon, and Korea (both really strong in science for different reasons).

**How To Gain An Edge**

The easiest way to get an edge is to be ahead in science, no matter what victory type or game mode you are playing. More science means you will be ahead in technology, letting you build important wonders before anyone else and have a stronger, more advanced military. So yeah, no matter what victory type you are going for, try to have good science. There are a lot of ways to do this; most of which you need to get a decent population for. For example, every 1 citizen will give you 1 science, and then buildings such as the library will give you extra science based on how many citizens you have in that city (in the library's case, 1 science per 2 citizens). There are a few other ways you can get science yield, for example through great people or specialists, which I'll give their own little headings since they are important.

**Specialists**

A specialist is a citizen who instead of working a tile surrounding the city, is working a building that the city constructed. Only certain buildings allow for specialists to work them, for example the university has space for 2 scientists or a workshop has 1 space for an engineer. The yield from specialists is set based on the type of specialist, and will also give you points towards the appropriate great person. For example, scientist gives you 3 science per turn, as well as 3 points towards a great scientist per turn, where as an engineer will provide you with 2 production, as well as 3 points towards a great engineer per turn. There are some social policies and otherwise that effect their yields, for example in the Rationalism tree, the Secularism policy adds 2 science per turn to every specialist (for example, an engineer would give 2 production and 2 science).

**Great People**

There are various great people and they can be obtained in a lot of ways. Most great people have 2 functions; they can give you a 1 time boost, or create a special tile improvement. For example, a Great Scientist will give you a 1 time science boost based on the science you have gathered in the last 8 turns, or can be turned into an academy, which gives a tile a yield of 8 science. (so if it was built on a hill, the hill would have 2 production and 8 science). A Great Engineer can be used to provide a huge amount of production towards a World Wonder (often allowing it to finish in a single turn), or can provide you with a manufactory which provides 4 production, so a hill would then give you 6 production instead of its normal 2.

Normally, to get a great person you need great person points (which you can get from either specialists or wonders, for example the Great Library provides great scientist points per turn), but there are a few other ways, such as Wonders (Leaning Tower of Pisa) or Social Policies (filling out the tree). There are also ways to boost the number of points per turn, such as gardens.

**Best Way to Take/Defend Cities**

In attacking, defending and waging general wars, ranged units are very important. If they are inside a defending city, it allows you to get a second hit off on an enemy per turn (with the first being the city), and if they're attacking a city there isn't a retaliation attack like there is when you hit it with a melee unit. Similarly, if they attack another unit, whether it's ranged or melee, there will be no retaliation. I generally have far fewer melee than ranged; the melee units are just there to protect the ranged units and get the final hit on enemy cities, since only melee units can take cities.
Also, artillery type units are great to have since they have an improved range and their upgrades can give them things like doing extra damage to fortified units or cities, which make it much easier to take down an enemy with a strong defensive position. When you are trying to take an enemy city, don't ever hit it with melee units until the final hit - it's never really worth it unless you're going to take it that turn because the cities do so much damage to them.

**Collecting Resources**

You collect resources (such as iron, horses, uranium, coal, etc) by building an improvement on the appropriate tile. For example, building a Mine on an Iron tile. To get the resource, the tile doesn't need to be worked by a citizen, just have the proper improvement built on it, so can actually be outside a cities working radius as long as it's within your borders. Each tile that has a resource will actually provide you with different amounts which you can see by hovering over (for example, one tile may have 3 iron, but the other 8), and the total number you have is how many you can spend. So if you have 11 iron total, you can make 11 swordsmen total and will be unable to make a 12th. I generally don't worry too much about a lot of the resources unless I really need them, so if I don't have Iron I won't worry too much. Coal, Aluminium and sometimes Uranium are very important for your late game however, so you should make sure you have them.
If there aren't any within your own borders, you can either 1. found a new city near the resource, 2. trade with someone for them, or 3. if there is a city-state with some in their borders, become their ally through giving them gifts and gaining influence and they will give you the resource as long as you remain their ally. Or, you know, if you're feeling a bit war hungry you could just take an opponents city that has the resources within their borders.

**Keeping Citizens Happy**

The easiest way to get happiness is through luxury resources. Each unique luxury resource will provide you with 4 happiness. However, multiples will not, so if you have say 2 salt, you may as well trade the second to someone either for a luxury resource of their own (that you don't already have), or gold per turn. You can also get happiness using buildings such as the Colosseum, or wonders such as Notre Dame.

Also, if you want some general tips/tricks (some basic, some a little more advanced), if you look at my submissions I posted a video to this sub a while back.

With this mindset you are actually getting ""more"" out of the game than normal players, it shows that you want to fully understand the rules in place and where you can be the most efficient with your time played

While this may be detrimental to the overall ""fun"" and ""enjoyment"" that some players experience, this is, in it's own way, fun to you (unless it becomes a chore, like it has for me)

By utterly destroying the game using these efficiency tactics, you are technically using your time in the most efficient manner possible, because you won't have to make the ""mistakes"" that others have made in order to play the game to its ""full potential""

The problem is, with this mindset, you usually wont play a new release until you have more information on it, which was heart breaking for me, I eventually adopted a new mentality of simply playing and trying to enjoy the mistakes I made, and use it as a learning experience, mainly because when I was gaming, I wasn't usually in a time-crunch, so why bother boosting efficiency?

Efficiency mentality is great for achievements and trophies ([please don't laugh too much](http://psnprofiles.com/Mastarifla) I know that I used quite a bit of time on ""nothing"", but I found it somewhat prideful, even if others do not care)

&gt;Hey guys,

&gt;Just wanted to post some very quick early sketches we've done for an alternative loot beam.

&gt;We can't choose, so let us know which one you like best!! 

&gt;'Do all of them' isn't useful :p - if only we had time!

&gt;[Lootbeam Concepts](http://i.imgur.com/vFCTepA.png)

**- Update 27/06/2014**

&gt;The Ninja team are now full speed ahead with Boss Slayer!!!

&gt;For those paying attention, the two polls we had up last week are now closed. Results have determined that Death will be the representing NPC and the title unlock for killing all the bosses incorporated in Boss Slayer will be ""_ the Reaper""; which is nice as the two go quite well together.

&gt;Ana put some quick concepts for a new lootbeam (see above) on the forums, twitter, and reddit. We've kept an eye on what people have said, and it would appear a majority thought that the rainbow was the best. As such, this will be an unlockable reward through Boss Slayer.

&gt;Labl has started work on Death's office, the place you'll be going to receive your daily Boss Slayer task. Below is an early work in progress model of the area:

&gt;[Death's Office](http://i.imgur.com/w3WFNGo.png)

&gt;*(everything is still greybox so it is subject to change)*

&gt;Asherz has been working on a new interface which will display all the bosses available in Boss Slayer with total kills, fastest kill, available drops, as well as some other information. You'll also be able to see a variety of other monster kill counts on the interface as well.

&gt;That's all for this week... You stay classy Gielinor!

**- Update 04/07/2014**

&gt;This week we've made a bit of a change to the face of the project. Now that Death has been voted in as the representing NPC, we decided to theme it a bit more around him and not so much existing Slayer.

&gt;Don’t worry, this won't change anything that we currently have planned, it just means instead of being **assigned** something, you're told to **reap** them instead. The implication being that you collect the souls of the monsters you kill for Death. This is something we're pretty excited about, it made sense to make the change, giving the content much more depth and context in game.

&gt;We mentioned before that we were going to be putting out a pre-release for this project which consisted of boss and monster kill tracking, as well as instanced boss kill timers. Asherz has been working away at getting this sorted as quick as he can so it can be put into game ASAP. This will give you a nice little head start at killing bosses, not only for practice but also towards some of the unlockable rewards going out with the main release a few weeks later.

&gt;Labl is still working away at the 3D environment for Death's office, and it's starting to look hawt! What do you think of this work in progress?

&gt;[Death's Office](http://i.imgur.com/JV3IuSd.png)

&gt;*(currently using Death's old model as a placeholder - also, Roddeck army not included)*

&gt;Ana has been putting some concepts together for one of the rewards that we haven't mentioned yet. I think we'll keep this one up our sleeves for a little while longer as it's pretty darn juicy. 

&gt;Stu O has managed to get his claws on a new Kalphite Queen model which he’s now bringing to life with some fresh animations. We’ll be adding this to our main release as a nice little booster. Again, let us know you think.

&gt;[New Kalphite Queen Model](http://imgur.com/a/ZrY19)

&gt;Finally, we've seen a few people asking for an ETA for this update. We're currently looking to have the pre-release ready to go out towards the end of this month and the actual release should be around the middle of August. This can obviously change but they're our expected release times for those that wanted to know. Quite annoying having to wait but it should definitely be worth it.

-Use Team Rose. Their levels  are the easiest.

-When you're boosting, use Big (power character). He's the easiest one to control when boosting

The reasoning for three ships with torpedoes was the threat of opponents Borg Cubes looming over the star mat as well as the OP random moving cube to deal with.

&gt;Second. If you basically cosign for the mortgage, it will show up on your credit. It could be good and bad. Bad that it'll reflect on how much more money you can borrow and may dip your score. Good that if everything goes well for long term, it'll show you are even more responsible.

This is right, but one thing you need to remember is that at a 720 credit score you can do anything you want granted your DTI (debt to income) pans out. So a boost in credit wouldn't help you one bit, and /u/apark78 is partially correct that it will affect how much you can borrow. If you provide proof (generally 10 months) that you are not the one paying the mortgage generally lenders will not count it in your DTI calculations. 

Now the thing to remember is that if something happened you could be held responsible for the deficiency. There are generally 3 types of recourse a mortgage company can do if you get foreclosed on. For this example I will use an example of them buying the house for $850k and then getting foreclosed on when it's only worth $600k. 

Non recourse- The bank just gets the house, nothing more. Though they can and generally will send you a 1099 do you would need to claim that $250k as income for the year. Read; You and your cousin owe hella big taxes that year. 

Single Recourse: The bank gets 1 try to come after you and if it doesn't work all they can do is issue a 1099

Full Recourse: They can sue you in court for the $250k and get a judgement. The fun part about this is that they would probably sue you over your cousin in this case because your cousin would have just gotten foreclosed on and is probably broke. So you are their best option to collect. They can sue anyone or everyone on the mortgage they choose. I don't see this happen too often but in a case like yours I would suspect it to be more likely because you probably have money whereas most people getting foreclosed on don't. 

IMO I wouldn't touch this with a 10 foot pole if they need you to cosign it's because they can't afford the house or their credit sucks. Either way RUN. You have TONS of downside to this deal and pretty much no upside. ",1,Nurum,True,t3_29m8vd,0,cimn4z6,0,1434515485,

{But he likens a walking kangaroo to a skateboarder who has one foot on the board and uses the other foot—in this case a tail—to push backward off the pavement, increasing the forward motion.}

http://phys.org/news/2014-07-tale-kangaroo-tail.html


The research project had its beginnings in 1973, when Dawson, a visiting professor at Harvard University, was working with Harvard Professor Richard Taylor, who later became Kram's advisor. Dawson coaxed a small group of kangaroos to hop and walk on a large motorized treadmill, with a goal of measuring the energy costs of locomotion at varying speeds. Dawson and Kram eventually showed that a kangaroo can increase its metabolism by 50 times during exercise.

nvolving researchers at the University of Colorado Boulder, Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada, and the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, the study illuminates the seemingly mundane task of foraging by red kangaroos. While such activity appears awkward, it turns out their tails provide as much propulsive force as their front and hind legs combined as they eat their way across the landscape.
""We found that when a kangaroo is walking, it uses its tail just like a leg,"" said Associate Professor Maxwell Donelan of Simon Fraser University, corresponding author for the study. ""They use it to support, propel and power their motion. In fact, they perform as much mechanical work with their tails as we do with one of our legs.""
""We went into this thinking the tail was primarily used like a strut, a balancing pole, or a one-legged milking stool,"" said Associate Professor Rodger Kram of CU-Boulder's Department of Integrative Physiology, a study co-author. ""What we didn't expect to find was how much power the tails of the kangaroos were producing. It was pretty darn surprising.""

Red kangaroos are the largest of the kangaroo species in Australia. When grazing on grasses, they move both hind feet forward ""paired limb"" style while using their tails and front limbs together to support their bodies. ""They appear to be awkward and ungainly walkers when one watches them moseying around in their mobs looking for something to eat,"" said Kram. ""But it turns out it is not really that awkward, just weird.""

In human locomotion, the back foot acts as the gas pedal and the front foot acts as a brake, which is not especially efficient, said Kram. 

But he likens a walking kangaroo to a skateboarder who has one foot on the board and uses the other foot—in this case a tail—to push backward off the pavement, increasing the forward motion.

The kangaroo tail also acts as a dynamic, springy counterbalance during hopping and boosts balance when male kangaroos grab each other by the chests or shoulders, then rear back and kick each other in the stomach in an attempt to assert dominance for the purpose of reproduction.

Although much of the data for the new study was collected years ago, other research efforts by the team members slowly pushed some of the key kangaroo locomotion data to the back burner. ""But this was a study we just could not let go of,"" said Kram. ""It was just too much fun. It's a real wonder of nature, how these kangaroos move about and what they are able to do.""

Kram calls the evolution of the kangaroo tail, which is thought to have been prehensile when opossum-like kangaroo ancestors were living in trees, an ""exaptation""—a shift in the function of a biological trait over time. He likened it to a roll of duct tape in the back of a truck. ""You know you are going to use it, you just don't know when,"" he said.
""I'm envious of kangaroos,"" said Kram, a competitive master runner in the mile and 1,500 meters. ""When they hop faster, they don't use energy at a faster rate. The have the ability to move faster and not get tired, the ultimate goal of a runner.""

&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYO3tOqDISE

I'm not sure which questions of mine this video is meant to answer. Are you attempting to show that capitalism is a form of central planning? That this type of organization can't exist outside capitalism? What exactly? (please note: market does not necessarily = capitalist market). Also the video begs the question with regards to voluntary and the entire calculation problem assumes a monetary market to begin with by which price signals are necessary, when this isn't necessarily the case (or doesn't have to be). It positions the burden of proof squarely on the shoulders of those levying this criticism, because the criticism itself carries with it the assertion that prices are required at all.  

Essentially, they need to answer the questions you've failed to answer.

&gt; And WHY, does another person believe with confidence that other humans will continue to buy?

That's what I'm asking *you*.

&gt;BECAUSE HE HAS INFORMATION THAT LEADS HIM TO BELIEVE THAT.

What information and how is this information arrived at?

&gt;But the whole point is that he possesses information that leads him to have certain beliefs about future demand.

No. The whole point was that this ""information"" was solely contained within the price of a commodity. You have yet to demonstrate this.

&gt;The resulting price, therefore, captures the information that person possesses regarding future demand and communicates it to other actors.

I bought a pack of gum today for $1.95. What is the future demand of this gum?

To put it differently- How does the price of a good ""capture the information that person possesses regarding future demand and communicates it to other actors""? 

&gt;ACTUAL future demand will not be known until it actually manifests. THERE IS NO CRYSTAL BALL THAT ANYONE CAN USE TO TELL THIS WITH 100% CERTAINTY IN ADVANCE.

Therefore, price does not directly communicate this. 

&gt;However, parties with information are able to make predictions and thereby take risks on information.

But this information is NOT acquired from the price of a commodity, correct? I mean, if it were then I presume you'd simply answer my question. 

&gt;So while production isn't instantaneous, the use of futures contracts allows the producers to produce based on expected future demand so that if/when said demand arises, they have the goods already produced.

This still doesn't answer my question about the information you assert exists here, and the implication of your criticism that money communicates it and is thus a requirement for resource distribution.

&gt;The central planner has to make its plans for the entire economy based on is predictions of future demand, and if it gets its calculation about the future demand wrong, the entire system is thrown off. The central planner, however, has little incentive to collect the best information since the central planner does not suffer directly if they are wrong nor are they rewarded directly for being right.

How exactly do you define ""central planner"" or ""centrally planned"" as you use the terms here?

&gt;I'm really not sure where you're getting your definitions of terms here. 

Which ones specifically?

&gt;Efficiency simply means producing the most 'benefit' for the least 'cost.'

Not in the context of a monetary market system. Efficiency means producing and distributing something at a profit. The level of efficiency is dictated by the level of profit.

&gt;This allows for different value systems to operate simultaneously to determine what 'benefits' you are pursuing. However you still need information in order to act at all. If your goal is to feed the maximum amount of hungry people, you still need to figure out how to produce the most food for the lowest 'cost' (in this case, 'cost' being labor and resources needed to produce the food). The more people you can feed for the same cost, the more efficient you are. So you need to find the lowest possible price for your labor and resources to produce the maximum possible output.

&gt;Prices help you calculate the 'cost' of labor and resources

How? If the ""cost"" is simply how much human labor and other resources are required for production, how does price come into this? 

&gt;More like there are massive distortions caused by state action which results in sub-optimal outcomes. For instance, food aid sent to Africa[2] actually demolishes their ability to produce their own food since it boosts the supply of food, which necessarily drops the price of food, which makes their own local farmers unable to sustain themselves.

Which is entirely and absolutely a failure of the monetary market system, as you so explicitly outline. 

&gt;Or you could get worse situations, where a state will place tariffs or outright bans on importation of foreign goods (which, amounts to a self-imposed blockade) which means that the food supply is artificially restricted which raises prices and may cause people to go hungry.

Again, another failure of the monetary market system. You seem to come to this discussion with preconceived notions of my own position. Why suddenly is the state the subject of your reply? Hint: Just because someone disagrees with you on one aspect about money does not mean they are suddenly a statist. I suspect you're attempting to maneuver the discussion towards a topic you believe you are actually capable of talking about (although I have my suspicions about that as well) by laying out bait statements about how terrible the state is. I am anti-state (which is also why I am anti-capitalist). However, this is all an aside to the main point of our discussion, but you probably know this. 

&gt;These are specifically features of state interference, not market failures.

It is not necessarily either or, as you've already outlined.

&gt;Do you sincerely think that farmers don't want to feed as many people as possible?

That depends. But I do know, as your first video so eloquently highlighted, that farmers are incentived to only ever care about whether or not they can operate their enterprise efficiently (meaning, profitably)which, as the hungry will attest, does not necessarily = feeding everyone and are incentived against attempting to feed people for the sake of feeding them. 

&gt;That they would actively avoid growing their market for food? What sense does that make? Who does that benefit?

It depends on how saturated the market is with their product and the curves on prices that would be a result of changing that supply. Scarcity raises prices, so to some extent there is an incentive to create scarcity in the market for the sake of personal profit. It is, after all, the property system necessitated by such a monetary market system. One of scarcity creation, not alleviation. 

&gt;Clearly the price provides the with the necessary information to make this choice

You assume the choice exists when, by definition, it doesn't. 

&gt;Lemme ask you: how would you even begin to allocate scarce resources amongst the various people of this planet if you did not know how abundant the resources were and where the resources were most useful?

I'm not sure. You're not implying that price communicates all of this, are you? Because holy shit we'd be back to square 1 of you simply failing to answer my question in the first place. 

&gt;How would you begin to acquire that information?

By empirically demonstrating how many resources were available for extraction, refinement, and production, determining what they could produce and, based on a value set, determining what ought to be produced. ",1,[deleted],True,t3_29918a,0,cimftx9,0,1434511816,

First thing to keep in mind about smithing.. is that it's a gathering skill. If you plan on getting high smithing on your character it's a good idea to start collecting materials early on. You should carry a pickaxe with you at all times &amp; have a follower to hold your ores/ingots.

Second, before you even start training smithing, go do the quest 'Unfathomable Depths'. It doesn't take long, but could be challenging at low levels. Once you've completed it, you'll receive a permanent ""power"" called ""Ancient Knowledge"" This gives you a 15% increase to leveling smithing.
http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Unfathomable_Depths

3rd, Have the warrior stone equipped. This will give you another 20% Smithing leveling increase. Along with that, always sleep before you train smithing. You'll get usually a 10% to 15% leveling boost to all skills. This depends if you sleep with a spouse or not.

ALSO avoid all smithing skill books until you're a higher smithing level.

That's a 50% boost to smithing in total, cutting the materials needed to train smithing to 100 in half.

~ 15-30

Very easy, you should keep any metal/materials you've gather &amp; just buy the materials for these levels. They're very cheap to buy from any black smith. Buy iron ingots &amp; leather. Make Iron daggers &amp; leather bracers. Shouldn't take to many to reach 30. You could also train on a black smith trainer, as the levels are very cheap early on.

~ 30 - onward.

Now, back to the point that this is a gathering skill &amp; cannot be power leveled without preparation.. Unless of course you're loaded on gold.

You're going to need to find mines &amp; dwarven ruins. It's important to have a follower with you. The main ores you're going to look out for is Iron, Silver, &amp; gold. You'll need to get the spell 'transmute mineral ore' Transmute any iron into silver, &amp; any silver into gold. Save the ingots in a chest in your home until you're stocked with a bunch of it. (preferably whiterun or a hearthfire home, one close to an anvil. As you're not going to be able to run.)
http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Transmute_Mineral_Ore

I suggest saving your gold until later levels, I'll explain later on.

Dwarven ruins. You'll need to find dwarven metal pieces to smelt into ingots. Refer to this page: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dwarven_Smithing#Dwarven_Smithing It'll show you want dwarven metal can be smelted, as not all can. Bring a follower to hold all the heavy pieces of metal, while you hold the lighter pieces.
(It's a good idea to get your follower fortify carry weight gear.)

On that wiki page you'll see that Mzulft alone has 472 ingots worth or metal/pure ingots. You'll need to make multiple trips to that ruin storing the metal in your house. 

Once you have a good amount of metal, start smithing dwarven bows. You'll need 1 iron ingot for every 2 dwarven ingots. The iron ingots should be bought from blacksmiths. As any iron ore you get you'll want to turn to gold. 

REMEMBER, warrior stone 20%, Sleep 10-15%, Ancient knowledge 15%, have these before smithing anything except before level 30.

Smith your bows, you'll get from 30 to 100 or a high level (85-90s)

With your gold.. make jewelry, do not use your gold on anything that's not made with a gem, as it's a good idea to save those as-well. You'll get a bunch from mining. Also check the highest value. This method is faster than smithing dwarven bows, but takes alot of gems &amp; gold which are both a rarity. You could however get prowlers profit.

Skill books should be read at 90+ if you can wait that long.

I'm going to cut this guide short as I'm typing this I realized how late it was, I have to sleep. I'll make an edit of the fastest method in the game when I get up.

Read all the hover text and you'll be fine. Also, Civ is one of those games where you learn from your mistakes. Don't be afraid to lose. You'll work out after a while the best ways to do things.

Some very basic tips for you though:

- Depends a little on what race you're playing but you'll want to get a few more cities early on. Connect them with roads. Even when playing with races like India, who suffer from having too many cities, you'll still want to get 2-3 cities early on. Your opponents won't hesitate to expand like crazy, so keep those resources out of their hands. Real estate is Civ's greatest commodity.

- Speaking of commodities, your three universal resources are food (food surplus causes city population to grow, meaning you can work more city tiles at the same time), production (how fast you can build units and buildings) and gold (see point below). Every tile has its own resources depending on what's in that tile (e.g. grassland usually has 2 food, a hill usually has 2 production). A city's output increases with a higher population since you can work more tiles at the same time, but they also become harder to manage. Harvesting other resources (see below) and building improvements will increase the food/production/gold in a tile.

- Think of gold as your ""FUCK IT I WANT IT NOW"" resource. It's useful in diplomacy/trading but otherwise try not to stockpile too much of the stuff. You can buy units and buildings instantly with gold, so it's incredibly useful for certain situations, like getting a fledgling city without many production resources off its feet, or helping out an undefended city that's under attack. Early gold is a massive advantage for most civs.

- Likewise, scout early. Ancient ruins give you useful gold, scouting, unit upgrades etc. These early advantages are first come, first served - once a ruin is gone, it's gone. Finding out where the best resources are *before* you build your 2nd and 3rd cities is invaluable.

- You'll see resources littered all around the place. Gold, furs, cows, truffles, spices, bananas, etc. Try to found your cities near these. To actually access resources in your borders, you need to improve them with a worker. Different resources need different improvements (e.g. gold/silver need a mine, furs need a camp, bananas need a plantation, etc.), some improvements you need to research before you can build them. Just place a worker on top of the resource and you'll get the option to build something.

- Click on the city name to bring up the city screen. This screen is super important. Learn your way around it. Learn how to manage which city tiles you work, later on you'll need to learn how to allocate citizens to different jobs to help out different facets of your civilisation. Revisit these screens regularly and try to squeeze out as much as you can.

- You expand a city's borders by collecting culture. The bigger the city, the more culture you need to expand by another tile. Build monuments early in cities, and if a city has a lot of precious resources near its borders then build as many cultural buildings as you can, as early as you can. Culture also allows you to unlock social policies, which basically give you a whole bunch of useful perks.

- It takes a while to learn the best spots for founding a city (though Civ does help you by giving you 'recommended' spots when you click a settler). Ideally you want somewhere with ample food to expand (i.e. grassland and any food resources like wheat), enough production so you can build stuff without it taking forever (i.e. hills, production resources like stone, marble, etc.), and enough gold to keep you in the black for a while. But it can also be massively beneficial to build your city next to certain things, like rivers, the ocean, mountains, deserts etc. For example, building on or next to a desert allows you to build a solar power plant later. Building on the coast allows you to build a lighthouse/harbour/seaport, all of which improve sea tiles. Building next to a mountain lets you build an observatory, which gives you a huge boost to that city's research. You'll learn all this as you go. Since your borders gradually expand as you get culture, you should concentrate harder on starting the city on the best possible tile, rather than having the most/best resources in the initial city borders.

- Wonders take a long time to build but give you big bonuses. The bonuses are very specific, so pick the wonders you build and where you build them carefully.

- Every race plays differently. Chinese and Romans are great at expanding and conquering. Indians prefer growing just a few cities to massive sizes. Polynesians can travel across oceans right at the start of the game, which gives them a massive early game advantage on non-Pangaea maps since they can sneakily colonise a whole continent while everybody else is fighting over the landmass they started on. Some civs are weak at the start but grow into powerhouses, some are powerful at the beginning but will find it harder to dominate in the late game if they don't press that early advantage. Specialise in what your civ does best. Build wonders and pick social policy branches that best suit your civilisation's strengths.

Have fun. Civ V was a bit iffy at launch for a lot of reasons, but since BNW and G&amp;K it's become a really solid Civ game.

0,,t1_cilgl97,2,1404187664,,t3_29ijia,1404187874,whowouldwin,False,,t5_2s599,"Krav Maga is my martial art of choice. I travel around the country, looking for incredibly corrupt police departments.  Being corrupt, these guys are most definitely arrogant, and won't notice me stalking them.  I only kill one at a time, and leave the state, by car, immediately after the kill, passing all the way through the adjacent state, and no state cops either.  I learn marksmanship, and other basic combat training.  Some are most likely fitness nuts or ex-military due to failed physiological exams, so there is my military training and brute force.  Once I learn enough basic attack techniques and combat survival skills, I can move onto the next step. 

(I am not proud of this, but it has to be done) I go to a relatively upper class neighborhood and go on a slaughter-fest during some community event, leaving a note with a clever name for myself, such as ""The Extractor"" or something stupid like that.  I am definitely on the town's, state's, and even the country's radar thanks to the news.  Then I lie low for a while, selling my house, and investing my money wisely with the new money management skills I have just acquired.

Interning at Stark Industries gets me close to my first high-valued target (working with local companies and universities in my state in finding flaws with their cyber security gives me an edge here).  I eventually work my way up, killing scoundrels here and there on the street to boost my strength, and get to meet Stark.  I tell him of the dagger, and what it can do.  He doesn't believe me, as he is hungover, so I show him the teleporting ability to my belt and he is astounded.  He wishes to study it, but I tell him I want to meet SHIELD and I must go with the dagger at all times.  He agrees after some arguing, and I go to meet the team.  Obviously Thor and the Hulk are dealing with their own problems, and are not present.  

As soon as I get on the ship, and come into the presence of Hawkeye, I go supervillian.  Stabbing him in the back gives me super precision. I shoot to kill anyone without an extraordinary skill set, and shoot to wound everyone else.  Captain America is most likely not prepared and both he and Ironman are out of their suits at this point.  A wounded Captain America is easy to take out. And at this point I believe I have a 7/10 chance of surviving.  I can either attempt to take out Stark, or run, so I run, as his Mark 42 armor is very close by now, and I don't want to risk it.  I do leave another note with my coined name at the scene. An ejectable pod is my method of escaping.  No time to waste now, I go into NYC on a shooting spree, waiting for Spider-man's spidey senses to kick in. Taking him down is no match with the Captain's strength.  I periodically stab other people, in hopes of gaining new abilities.  I estimate I have killed anywhere from 2-6 mutants, which are most likely delta level, and I gain abilities such as controlling bug life, basic flight, and the ability to use sunlight as a food source (so stupid abilities, except in very, very specific situations). 

I now threaten all the locals to help me deal with Ironman, as he is definitely on his way.  My spidey senses warn me when he is coming, and assuming he just doesn't blow the building up, I have a fighting chance.  If he isn't willing to kill the scared people I have sent after him, I reckon I have a 8/10 chance to kill him.  My increased knowledge lets me hack into every security system in the world, and I quickly track Wolverine while he is away from the school.  I manage to immobilize him.  His regeneration won't help him if I hold him in a cell.  After a couple days, he is dehydrated and starved, and weak enough to kill.  I make a homemade video, of me killing Wolverine, and then going into the closest city on a shooting/stabbing spree. I get shot, and regenerate back to full health.  The video then displays my name that I have left at all the crime scenes, and I email it to all the news outlets I can think of.  

Now SHIELD, the X-Men, and the Fantastic Four have me at the top of their lists. Thankfully I have kept some of Ironman's armor and adapted it to my own tastes (as I personally think it's cool) and unknowingly save myself from the psychic's attacks.  I tell the world that I am hunting it's strongest characters, and anyone who stands in my way will be at my mercy.  Due to my killing frenzies and infamous popularity, I create a panic attack.  The world turns on itself, and all of the elite organizations round up their strongest members and hide them away.  It is a bit of a poker play on my part, because if they all work together, I would be toast.  One character does not get collected with the others, and that's the Hulk, hiding in his feeble human body.  With Stark's knowledge, I am able to track him down, and kill him, as flight, regeneration, and strength in combination with my fighting tactics are able to take him down.  I only use the dagger for the final kill, as wounding him with it is pointless. 

At this point, Thor brings his friends down and begins to track me his own way.  Professor X makes a risky decision to release the Phoenix.  At this point, I'm not hiding, and when the two find me, I stomp.  The lightning almost tickles, but due to Mjolnir, I take out Phoenix first.  I take her psychological ability, and as my body grew stronger over the years, so has my mind, so the ability is stronger than ever.  It takes a little to get used to, but I eventually mop up Thor with little problems. I can now control the legendary hammer, which can shoot lightning itself.  I have no use for Ironman's armor anymore. Taking out the rest of the X-Men is now more of a chore, and then I absorb as many unique powers as I can.  Loki comes out of hiding at backstabs me, only to have the blade shatter.  He always was a bit of a coward, and I knew I could count on him showing up late. The Fantastic Four, Daredevil, and Doom basically get cleaned up at this point.

I now attract the attention of galaxy tier characters and time travelers (not familiar with Marvel time travelers).  I hold myself until one comes along and I gain the ability to time travel.  I go back in time, to when I originally found the dagger, and now I have two.  These are the only weapons I will ever wield, and I use my trapezius muscles as sheaths.  

At this point, one of two scenarios will take place
1. I protect the Earth as a guardian, and have no need to travel to other worlds or increase my strength. My guilty conscious has been relieved, as all of the people I killed have technically never been dead.  I make a shit ton of money, by having people try to kill me, and then kick back with my new god friends.  
2. My arrogance gets the better of me, and I take on a celestial tier character, and get my ass handed to me.  Said character takes my daggers, takes down the other powerhouses and as a result, the universe collapses.

Unfortunately, the second situation would be the most likely of the two

Bullshit, if a rebel faction had been targetted by another group, that group would have spoken up. It doesn't explain either, why the two untouched missile sites point back to government held areas and not rebel areas.

&gt; 1) lure external forces in to setting up a no flight zone, Libya style or sending gear and weapons they can eventually get their hands on.

Stupid reasoning, considering if they did it then they gassed hundreds of anti-Assad fighters for absolutely nothing.

&gt; 2) because they got the weapons and there was no better target. using chemicals on the Syrian army is idiotic for several reasons, the most basic one being that they are equiped to deal with it.
&gt; the whole army was built around the idea of a possible conflict with Israel using chems, they are trained and geared to charge in to a cloud of gases and fight inside of it.
&gt; even if the rebels managed to get those crappy trashcan rockets and launchers in range to hit a command post, barracks, etc the loses will be minimal.

I wonder what's more likely, that or the Syrian government firing it on the rebels knowing they are NOT equipped **at all** for CW? Here's a hint - it's the former. Remember we're talking about a guy who doesn't care who he bombs into oblivion, he's already razed Homs and Aleppo to the ground even without CW.

&gt; unless they managed to find a propellant at least 10 times more potent than the ones used, or to fit 10 times more propelant in the same volume, aerodynamics is the biggest factor on this case.
its the old dilemma about the rocket and the brick, exept in this case they supposedly managed to make the brick flight with a smaller rocket instead of a bigger one.
i tell you something, if you explain me this , i drop the whole rocket issue:
the ""official"" ms-14 (that is, the real m-14 rocket fitted with a chemical warhead) carries 2.2 kgs of sarin with a max range of 18-20 km
now, the improvised rocket we are talking about carries 50-60 liters[1] of sarin. and had 40% less propellant. forget the aerodynamics for a second. can you explain me what kind of black magic gives that thing a similar range?

It doesn't need the range of 18-20km though, it appears to have originated from Mt Qassioun based on the rocket trajectories of two untouched landing sites and Mt. Qassioun is only ~9km away from the strikes. It's also 1.5km high. Not to mention, that mountain had some rocket launchers (capable of carrying CW) destroyed by the Israelis in an earlier air strike.

And why are you ignoring the fact that these 330mm rockets have only ever been [recorded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O7bhD1xW0Y) and used by Syrian military personnel? They have never been recorded in use by the rebels.

&gt; if that was the case, they will be attacking the numbers used. they aren't. there wasn't a single person, be military personnel or scientist putting those numbers in doubt, just a diplomat saying ""lol no"".

No denial =/= everyone approves. I know you're a conspiracy theorist but try and actually use some logic here. Ake described the report exactly as it was - a guess.

&gt; ... in combination with 1800 tons of mustard gas, as i said before. they never used their sarin alone, just as a booster with mustard gas. plus those numbers include the amount they lost to spoilage (it lasted only a couple of weeks once it was made because of the impurities and because they didn't used it as a binary agent).

My point still stands regardless if that's true or not. It was good enough to be a weapon, hence weapons-grade. It was 45-60% and the Sarin used was *even higher concentrations* then that. How many times do I have to repeat this for you?

&gt; by ""soon enough"" they mean ""1 minute"", it takes 1-10 minutes to die from sarin. by 10 min you are dead if you inhalated a lethal dose and there i no way around it. not to mention that sarin also penetrates the skin, so if you got exposed and someone else drags you to the hospital unprotected there is a good chance he dies too. even touching a wall in a exposed zone will kill you.
and we are talking about 50 liters of the thing on a single one of those 330mm rockets, can you see now why i talk about the low lethalty of those attacks compared with what it could be if done with the right dispersal methods and purity?.

Keyword ""IF"". Sarin is lethal if it collects in low areas or you breath high concentrations of it, but its lethality will obviously vary if you're standing further away from it, standing on high ground, etc. Even pure Sarin won't kill you if you receive a low enough dose.

Low lethality of these attacks? HAH. The families of 300-1,400 victims from a *single* coordinated attack would disagree with you. 

&gt; it was denounced BEFORE the attacks that the rebels were getting equipment from the Libyan arsenals.
and the Libyan chemical weapons depots were free for everyone to loot for several says durring the fall of gaddafi.
and there is this too http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/9735472/Al-Qaeda-may-have-chemical-weapons-Spains-counter-terror-chief-warns.html where the head of spanish counterintelligence said that AQ got chemical weapons, more likely from Libyan arsenals. al-nusra just happens to be part of AQ.

None of this is proof. Even the counter intelligence chief uses the term 'may' which means he's not certain. Even then, the vast majority of stockpiles still left over are internationally monitored. EVEN THEN, to get large amounts of Sarin (precursors or otherwise) from Libya to Syria would require you to transport it through 2-3 countries minimum, one of which would have to be Israel. That is EXTREMELY unlikely, especially considering Syria has the 3rd largest stockpile of chemical weapons. It would be far easier to steal from the government than to get it from Libya. This is why your Libyan Sarin reasoning is completely fucking retarded.

&gt; and the UN couldn't find any sarin on Libya, they did find empty warheads ready to use sarin and the precursors used to produce the sarin, but the actual already produced sarin wasn't anywhere to be found.

No surprise, Gaddafi declared most of his chemical weapon stockpiles and was supposed to have destroyed them all in 2004. They did find some CW that were undeclared and not destroyed but they are mustard gas, not sarin.

&gt; and by the way what the UN said was that, by the use of conservants in the formula, the sarin most likely came from an arsenal (as opposed to be homemade). they never linked it to the Syrian arsenal conclusively, that was the media.

READ THE UN REPORTS:
*""The evidence available concerning the nature, quality and quantity of the agents used on 21 August indicated that the perpetrators* ***likely had access to the chemical weapons stockpile of the Syrian military*** , *as well as the expertise and equipment necessary to manipulate safely large amount of chemical agents.""*

Auditory and visual filters blotted out the worst sensory shock but amplified the important parts. Thin weave fullerine protected them from the spines of the Orgiens without slowing them down. And their weapons were Quantum Rifles, the state of the art. Unstable molecules phased through armor and fried the victim inside. Despite all of this, and despite his practiced feline confidence and military training, Long-of-Fang still felt very small in the midst of this war.

Elephants charged over the rise of the basin, and fell just as quickly. The combined fire of the Orgiens weapons was simply too hot for their armor to absorb. It became a slugfest - Orgiens forced against a wall, and the Ert species too enraged to stop their charge. Mass of fire was the order of the day. The HUD in Longs' goggles told him that the lupine cavalry was circling around and gnawing at the Orgien flanks.

But at best, they could only hope to reduce the enemy number so that the main charge could overwhelm them. The number of Ert dead would be incalculable. 

Suddenly his goggles darkened until the day became night. Still he saw the massive fireball blow through the rim of the basin, and crawl through the sky towards the *Makers Fury.* In the last seconds before it hit he saw laser hawks engage the afterburners on their flight suits and streak off desperately. The *Fury* was struck in the center, and immediately caught on fire. It crumpled under it's own weight, more explosions spreading out from the impact point. They should have landed far enough from the edge of the valley that the enemy could not get a clear shot, but no one had considered that their weapon could fire directly through the dirt. 

With a shock, he realized the *Rubicon* was therefore, also in the line of fire. He knew what his orders would be, even as they printed out on his HUD.

Infiltrate. Disable enemy Anti-ship.

Long turned back towards his squad. There was Blood-on-Lip, a younger tiger, but the second in command. His family painted their fur to resemble the look of a recent kill. Eats-the-Bone, his third, a heavier tiger with muscle that hung from his body like fat, until he flexed it. He carried the plasma lance, an all purpose heavy weapon. And Wounds-the-Back, a very quiet and plain tiger without paint. Scrawny, but Long had seen him tear up a lupine with his claws over a scrap of synthesized tallow. 

Long turned without a word and headed to the tunnels that the initial charge had already flattened. His squad followed instinctively. 

--

The tunnels were smooth walled, soft and spongy. The tigers were wary about touching the alien surface with their bare hands, as is was in fact alive. The Orgiens were not just the mobile, spindly creatures above in the fight. In reality the entire underground structure was part of the Orgien species.

They had traveled what seemed like a kilometer and had no contact with any enemy force. It was dark, but they were feline. Only the small glow from their rifles was needed to light up the way. They came to a branch, with three paths going off in separate directions. Two went along horizontally, and the third went straight up. 

""It is too large to be anything but an access to some facility. The anti-ship is likely somewhere up there."" Blood-on-Lip spoke, still in the portal from the way they came. The rest of the squad was standing under the large upwards path.

It was silent when the tunnels closed off. Like an airway closing, all of the horizontal tunnels closed shut. Blood-on-Lip yowled in pain, caught in the archway, and then was quiet. The others didn't have time to check him, as Orgiens began to crawl down the walls from above. They were trapped in a killing field.

Eats-the-Bone had dialed his plasma cannon down to a thin, columned beam. He raked the blue, pencil-thin beam along the sides of the walls, and Orgien parts began falling around them. ""Climb!"" Long shouted at Wounds. Their claws slid out and they scaled the soft wall while Eats-the-Bone covered them. It was not long before they found another portal that lead into an open room. 

It seemed abandoned. It was filled with what seemed like rootlike structures, and in the center was a long cylinder. The air had the familiar, stale, moldy scent of Orgus Prime's atmosphere, as opposed to the stuffy scent of the tunnels. There was a huge opening to the world outside, but the opening was round and melted at the edges. This had to be the gun.

 Moments after Wounds and Long entered, Orgiens stepped out from behind the root structures and began firing. The Ertlings responded, their Quantum rifles phasing through cover and frying the enemy regardless of where they hid. Regardless, they were outnumbered. Blasts streaked all around the two, and it was a miracle they were untouched for as long as they were. Then Wounds was struck, and fell back through into the vertical tunnel. Long jumped after him but was too slow, and could only catch onto the edge and save himself.

There was another yowl from down below. At first Long thought Eats-the-Bone was killed, but then he saw the heavy feline clinging to the wall below him, his teeth through the nape of Wounds' neck. 

""There is an exit through the wall. It will be a long drop. The anti-ship is in there. As well as many prey.""

Eats-the-Bone motioned for Long to take Wounds from him. Then he said, ""Run for the exit. I can destroy the gun."" He began dialing the magnetic collimation of his cannon out, until the adjustment ring fell off. 

There was no point in arguing. The tigers were more than their ancient counterparts, now. They were crusaders. Eats-the-Bone would be a hero to millions, and none of them expected to come back alive anyway. As if they had practiced it a hundred times, both cats leapt over the edge into the gun room. The plasma cannon erupted, less of a cannon and more of a bluish flame thrower at this point. The Orgien tried to scatter as they burst into flame. The plasma ate through some sort of fuel line just as Long jumped from the hole the Anti-ship had burned in the wall. Flame, real, red flame, rolled out of the breach behind him.

He held onto the wall while Wounds, unconscious, dangled from his teeth like a kit. Below he could see the Orgiens failing. Laserhawks fired at the entryways as they tried to retreat into the safety of their tunnels. Occasionally he could see an individual simply drop, and he knew somewhere the sniper amphibians were gleefully firing at a retreating foe. Massive, tracked vehicles the size of buildings were rolling in slowly, launching grenades larger than elephants and guided missiles. The reptiles had arrived, and their artillery was sterilizing the Orgus ground of it's native lifeforms. Further in the distance, land runners were collecting the injured on trailers and hauling them back to the battleships. The battle was over. Orgiens were far from extinct, but they would be soon. Their ability to fight back was gone.

A Laserhawk rose up near Long-of-Fang. They were very much like eagles, but much larger, almost six meters in wingspan. A body suit they wore carried their small shoulder cannons, and high intensity ion boosters on their breasts, which allowed it to hover. The ions blasted downwards, then floated up into the hawk's outstretched wings. It moved closer, and took Wounds in it's talons. The hawk turned and blasted off towards the *Rubicon,* and another hawk lazily floated up to pick up Long.

Lilliti's voice burst through the speakers. ""Avian survivors of the *Makers Fury* will be boarding the *Rubicon.* Make them feel welcome. Medical capacity is full, further casualties will be directed to *Armorhide* and the medical ship *Deep Swimmer.* Casualty lists will be viewable outside of main engineering..""

Kee and Long were outside of the medical bay, watching Wounds-the-Back float unconscious in a tank of nutrient broth. Medic wrasse swam around him, flitting in and out of his injuries and doing what they could to repair him. He was missing most of his left forelimb. 

""What will we do now?"" Kee's voice was eternally calm, although it was a result of his voice actually being a translator. 

""The *Armorhide* will sterilize this colony, and any others they can find. Perhaps we terraform the planet afterwards.""

""I did not mean what will happen to Orgus. I meant what will we do?"" Kee was aware that Long-of-Fang was attuned to conflict. He was uncomfortable discussing anything else, or the implications of living in a world where the Gods no longer needed you. ""Must we find another planet? Or will we fight amongst ourselves now?""

Long curled his lip. He did not want to discuss this, but as with all matters, there was a time when it will force itself. ""The Gods did fight one another continually. They did conquer many new lands when Ert was young. Perhaps we must fight in one way or another. The Gods made us too different from one another to live otherwise.""

""I do not think the Gods expected us to make it this far. I do not think they expect anything from us now but to swim without purpose.""

""How can one live without purpose, Kee? Do you listen to yourself? If you do not live for something you might as well perish."" He knew the Delphin was trying to drag him into another intellectual conversation, which he always lost.

""One can choose to die for a purpose. That does not mean that it must be the meaning of their life."" After a pause, Kee continued. ""I think I will take the next shuttle to *Deep Swimmer.* I have not seen my pod in some time.""

Long was relieved to be talking about something simpler. ""I, as well, must find a female. It has been too long since I sired many kits.""

""That was not what I meant, my friend.""

Long-of-Fang padded down the metal hallway of the ship alongside his Delphin friend, and they found themselves wandering towards the shuttle bay.

Otherwise you are just going to gain. So, when implementing new habits think of the following five areas of health and some example habits:

* Happiness: Write one positive note about something in your life a day and collect it in a jar to read when you need a boost.
* Nutrition: Drink a glass of water each day. Add another glass when it becomes second nature.
* Cardio: Walk the dog ten minutes after dinner.
* Strength training: Do five pushups three times a week.
* Flexibility: Stretch before going to bed

The only one that really changes when you lose weight should be the calories consumed in the nutrition category. Nothing else should be changing. If you create too many hard habits you'll just revert back to old ways. Never implement too much at once. Sometimes that single glass of water everyday for a month will go longer in your life than a week of exercise in a year, because you are likely going to continue that smaller habit.

For instance, running is a great way to burn calories but realistically not everyone is going to enjoy it. If you much prefer a stroll to a 5k, just stroll around the neighborhood instead of running. You'd never keep up running if you truly hate it. That doesn't mean don't try something, but don't keep forcing yourself to do it if you don't like it. 

Some girls really don't like weight training (gyms are unfriendly, they don't like the heavy weights) but do just fine with pilates. Is one better? Yeah. But that doesn't mean pilates isn't good. It's just not as athletic. It's still good for you though and fulfills the strength training need.

0,,t1_cil0boj,2,1404152396,,t3_2972f4,False,outside,False,,t5_2r3f3,"PC appearance modifications are definitely achievable, but they often require grinding through lengthy and often uninteresting side quests to get the requisite Fitness stat improvements. 

The biggest obstacle besides playing through the tedium is that if these side quests are not played through to their end goal, then stats quickly revert to lower levels and sometimes you can receive penalties to stats like Will and Charisma, affecting the substats of motivation and self esteem the harshest. 

Many players repeatedly start these side quests, only to give up on them early on, because completion of these side quests requires such high use of the total number of action turns you have, which forces one to give up on a lot of fun quests that are sedentary to your PC. Many players are just not willing to give up on some of these aspects of their main quest, so first you must be ok with making a major change to the way you play out much of your own main quest. 

To make a dedicated effort to improve your avatar's body appearance, I highly recommend joining groups, or to have at least one alliance with another player with whom you attempt these side quests. This gets rid of much of the tedium and risk of stat loss from abandoning the quests. In scenarios with no available groups or alliances, one can always spend gold to have someone from the Trainer guild help you level up through the side quests quickly. Members of this guild can often be found around the local Gymnasium. 

The good news is that if you can overcome these common obstacles to complete the side quests, the stat bonuses can have really positive effects on your main quest, and are well worth the grinding tedium it can take to achieve them. 

Your daily spawn area may have a Gymnasium nearby, which is a good place to start many of the fitness quests. Gymnasiums are particularly good for improving Strength. If you desire your avatar to have a bulkier muscle appearance, seek advice from experienced denizens of the gymnasium, as increasing Strength stats does not always result in a bulkier avatar. Specialized practices and techniques are required for body building. Simple muscle tone improvements can be achieved by regularly engaging in most of the side quests at the Gymnasium. 

The key with any fitness stat improvements is to play at least one of these side quests on  a daily basis. Consistency is key. It can sometimes be grinding and tedious, but it is the only way to complete the goals that result in the best appearance boosts. 

Once your goals are achieved it becomes relatively easy to maintain these appearance changes, but keep in mind that they do have to be maintained. It is a series of side quests that should be performed throughout the rest of the game. 

Some other tips:

- The Devs designed the game so that the higher your player level, the more difficult it is to achieve these side quests, and often the stat bonuses are lower at higher levels. Stat bonuses can be cumulative, so the lower your level when you first complete these side quests, the easier it is to maintain the stat bonuses through later level progressions. So the sooner you start, the better!

- Many mini games have been developed that are very entertaining and rewarding, and actually result in completion of many of the fitness side quests! This is a great way to bypass the tedium of making regular visits to your local gymnasium. These mini games are collectively referred to as ""sport"", and have the added benefit of being played in groups, so there are additional benefits to motivation as well as meeting fun players who you can join on other quests you might otherwise not have known about. Some have reported success in the post-tutorial mating game by meeting potential partners at co-ed sports mini games. My favorite mini game to play is ""soccer"" also called ""football"" on non-American servers, because it has huge boosts to Endurance, Strength, and Reflexes. It's really fun too, and a great way to meet a lot of other players. 

- Another great way to get fitness stat boosts is by simply exploring the world map, either on foot or using a player powered mount (bicycles, skateboards, roller blades, skis, canoes, kayaks, etc). These exploration quests can be done solitary or in groups. The trick here is to keep active movement of your avatar for extended periods of time, which results in many of the same bonuses as the treadmill side quests at the Gymnasium, but without the tedium. Often the best stat boosts can come from exploration of non-urban environments, on pre-explored pathways that are referred to in-game as ""trails"". These paths offer beautiful scenic exploration (the Devs went all out in some of these areas), and often have terrain features which grant large boosts to fitness stats. These types of non-urban explorations are often referred to in game as ""hiking."" For time saving and increased fitness bonus, try accelerating your pace through explorations, a movement skill referred to as ""running.""

- Many of the Fitness quests at the Gymnasium can be completed on your own without spending gold. This requires a much higher Will stat than many players have though. For players just starting out on the Fitness quests, it is better to spend the gold to gain the experience first. ",2,mountain-ghost,True,t3_2972f4,0,cil0boj,0,1434482317,

1) Try to use spear traps over any other traps. Traps interfere with one another, so using the most damaging traps is best.

2) The best reforge is Lucky for all accessories, not Menacing. Not only does this boost DPS more, but +%crit also affects your traps! 

3) Concentrate the mobs to just one narrow strip of land. Ideally you should be on a platform with the ground just out of view, so that the mobs will spawn on that ground. You can also put lava in very shallow pits to the left and right of that strip of land just below you - mobs cannot spawn on lava so you can control where mobs spawn more easily. This approach also makes it easier to use only a handful of spear traps to attack the mobs that spawn.

4) Use Heartreach Potions. It's often an overlooked potion but it really helps with not having to move so much to collect hearts, and allows you to focus much more on attacking enemies.

I see people/PAD guide say ""+297"" quite a bit, is that what the max is as far skilling up a monster goes?

This acutally has nothing to do with skilling up, but rather refers to the +egg of a monster. the most + to hp, attack, and recovery is 99 each, therefore it would be +99 in hp, +99 in att, and +99 in recov, equalling to 297. Skill up is rather to reduce the overall cool down of a spell. Ill give an example. Valkarie's ability is to change heart to light, and this spell is up every 9 turns. However, fusing monsters with the same ability allows the skill to level up, so when the skill is level 2, Valk's abliity will be up in 8 turns instead. Max skill depends on the monster itself. For valkarie, the maximum it can be reduced to is 5 turns, therefore it would take 4 levels to ""max skill"" it. People talk about max skill because reducing the cooldown of a monster's ability is rather important at higher levels and such. 


• How long would you say it would take to fully skill out a single monster? How many times would you have to run through a single dungeon?

For most higher end monsters, there are only really two logical way to skill up a monster, either with itself or a cheap version of itself. I'll give valkarie as an example again. Her ability Attack Stance- Light, is present in only her 4 forms of evolution, a monster called ""Drops"", the yellow angry bird( we'll ignore him, he's Jap only), and nothing else. Now, if we were to logically skill up valkarie, we will have to either roll valkarie multiple times and fuse them into one, or do ""The Goddess Descended"" multiple times, then fusing them into one. That would be how to skill up. HOWEVER, keep in mind Drops has the exact same ability, and so we farm Drops and fuse Drops into Valkarie, thus saving stamina and easier to get. I will talk about collab and skill up dungeons in a later answer. But how long? well it depends on your luck. In front post, there was a person that had a 0.03% chance to have all 5 skill up into a lilith, but the general consensus is that people store 30-35 skill up monsters on x2 skill up, so that will give you an average. How many times do you have to run through a single dungeon? well that depends on your luck, i've had poring runs where all i got was nothing useful, and others i got a ton of skill up monsters, so its run until you get what you need. 


Are the more difficult dungeons going to reward you a larger amount of skill attributes to your monster than perhaps an easier one?

No, it isnt whether the monster is stronger or weaker, but rather it is the same skill. Fusing 5 valks that are max level has the same chances as fusing 5 valks at level 6, and same chance of getting skill up, that is. So no, but there are certain difficulties that yield the most drop, therefore indirectly more skill ups. 


Is it worth to try and max out your monster's skills before they're ultimately evolved? In other words, upon evolving a monster, will all of those skills that you grinded for be reset like everything else?

If the monster's skill is the same in both uvo(ultimate evolve), then it does not matter. For example, Valk (its easier to talk about than like Sonia ok, please forgive) can be max skilled up to 5 turns. When she evolves in all her stages, her ability stays the same, therefore it will still be 5 turns at her uvo. However, some monsters change skills, such as big baddie(turn heart to dark) and king baddie(x3 for 1 turn for devil). If i have a max skilled big baddie, i would evolve it, and all my skill points will be lost because it acquired a completely different skill. So its not just ultimate evolve, but just keep in mind when the evolve changes skill, the skills will be lost. HOWEVER, the +stats will not change no matter what you do to it. If my Valkerie is +124, it will still be +124 throughout its whole evolution life until i throw more +egg onto it.


Does the particular monster that you are wanting to skill up have to be used as the active leader within the team to receive these points? Or do they just have to be in the team in general?

No, skill up is on the power-up fusion. How leveling skills work is that you get a monster, IE VALK, and choose her to power-up. then you select 5 drops, and pray that the 5 drops will give her exp and a chance to skill up. And so skill up has absolutely nothing to do with running in a team. If i put valk as a substitute in a Green Odin team, for example, it will still be 5 turns when I put her into a Ra team. So you don't need a specific team to skill up. Skill up points are not from the dungeon, but from fusing.


• Lastly, is it worth it? For all the time and effort that it may take to max an entire team out with those skill dungeons, Does it make that much of a difference overall? Besides just stat boosts is there any other uses to doing this process that I may be overlooking?

Is it worth it? well depends on your team and how far you are. I had no skill ups on any monster all the way until the Starlight Santuary, and i did a lot of descends without skill ups. However, In very complex teams, yes skill up matters. Having an ability up in 5 turns versus 8 turns can mean that you will be in round 2 when the ability is up versus round 4, and you may need a specific monster's ability in a specific round. So it depends how far you are, but generally, when these ""skill up"" dungeons come around, it is advisable to see if you have anything to skill up, and maybe roll your luck and skill up one or two times. Stat boost? Well skill up actually does not give any direct stat boost. It does not increase health, recov, or attack. IT doesnt even  increase the damage of the ability if it is a damaging ability. It is simply for earlier cool down.


You may still not understand what im saying, but i will give you a very general overview of how I skill up my valkerie, and explanations.

Poring tower is a collab, meaning it is a collabaration with Ragnarok Online to make a dungeon. Skill up dungeons are just dungeons with monsters that have the same skill as an actual full-sized monster. Valk has a skill up monster in Poring called Drops, and so I do the dungeon multiple times until i have a lot of Drops to skill up my Valk. Different collab or skill up dungeons skill up different monsters. In the Poring Tower collab, the monsters that are exclusive to this dungeon, IE not found in normals or technicals or anywhere else, skill up multiple monsters. Poring skills up Light Golem and Dark golem. Drop skills up Valkerie. Marin Skills up Water Valkerie and Seigfried, Poporing skills up Cu Chulainn, angeling skills up hino kagutsuchi, and ghostring skills up Lilith. So if i have a lilith, valk, and Light golem, i would farm this dungeon multiple times in hoping to drop ghostring, drops, and poring because these 3 monsters correspond with the 3 monsters i want to skill up. Once i collect enough of these, I would go to power-up and select those 3, the add many, and add the corresponding skill up monster. Then that skills up the monster.

&gt;The rate booster packs are generated is based on the badge creation. The more badges that are created, the more booster packs are generated. ",1,Qwazzbre,True,t3_29dij2,0,cijwj97,0,1434455437,

However, they serve minor purposes. If you collect a whole set (you have to do that by trading, buying, or hoping you get lucky with booster drops), you can craft a ""Badge"". These badges can be featured on your profile, and they unlock goodies related to the event or game the card set is for.  Say for ""Team Fortress 2"" a set might get me a profile background, some Steam Chat stickers/emoticons, an in-game drop (like a hat, taunt or something), and often a coupon for some random game. You also get ""XP"" which is counted on your profile to level it up.

What does levelling up your profile provide? It is mostly just for ePeen imaginary internet points. However, it does provide some tangible benefits. It allows you more customization of your profile in the first few levels. After that, every few levels you unlock an extra 5 slots for your friend list (yes, they implemented a friend list limitation, and extend it by getting levels).  So if you have tons of clan buddies or trading partners, or a giant school-wide steam group that you constant banter with, you may want to level up. Most people get around this by being part of Steam Community Groups, which have their own chat rooms, forums, and announcements. 

So overall the benefit other than fancy doodads, hats, wallpapers, and internet points is low, but there is a benefit. Further, somebody with a higher level will be less likely to be immediately dismissed as a nobody basement dweller. They might think you are actually a basement-dweller who might know their shit.",3,ryocoon,True,t3_29cw89,0,cijr64h,0,1434451964,

Superman speed blitzes him, knocks him into orbit and watches him drift slowly out of the solar system over the course of a few decades. There's no way bane beats superman. 

edit: actually, it doesn't even matter if bane were stronger than superman. Bane still weighs less than what superman can lift, superman throws bane into space, the end. Or, superman is feeling particularly mean and throws bane into the center of jupiter. It's the same reason why the hulk can never beat superman, if you can't fly then getting thrown into space pretty much ruins your day. 

The only way bane beats superman is the same way batman beats superman, he gets his hands on all of the most powerful weapons in the DC universe, and they conveniently stack and they conveniently have none of their side effects like: one shot use and long reload time: insider suit, drives the user insane: black rock, has their own agenda: power rings, and so on. At that point, just like with batman, you're not talking about bane anymore and at that point I will counter with: superman speed blitzes with the phantom zone gun or any of the myriad super weapons that everyone seems to forget that he also has access to because he's been flying around the entire universe collecting them every time lois hurt his feelings.

The first things I looked at were the Agendas and Taboo. If I didn't like them I passed it up. I will not work towards some goal I don't agree with just for neat powers.

Mewtwo basically offers nothing I don't like though. Right from the top his quote is so bad ass and those conditions are easily things I'd be okay with. Being a scientist of some kind wasn't the last thing on my career list and I never go outside anyways.

The way things are phrased is something I find agreeable as well. Don't keep your discoveries secret and milk it due to greed, share that shit! I'm curious what excess would be, but I think enough to live on, provide for my family with a little extra sounds reasonable, like working a normal job or something.

For something I picked with no regard for powers, I really like mine too. The first two things are basic psychic abilities that grow with time and training. The Telekinesis will be useful in a fight, but Telepathy is where the most benefit can be found. Checking people's true intentions and reacting accordingly is a big boon, and being able to later turn that into straight up mind rape is. . .interesting.

Detection sounds like one of my dream abilities. Being able to know where other disciples are, passively, is an amazing defensive and utility power. Many of the other poke-gods and their disciples are violent or destructive, so being able to keep tabs on local ones is big. I see no reason I couldn't read their minds once I work it up strong enough, then I'll always be able to avoid the hostile ones and makes friends with the nice or agreeable ones.

The third one is just juicy though. A huge intellect boost and **all** scientific knowledge collected so far. . . it's just kind of stupid how good that is. First note the phrasing of the intellect boost, it says *at least* ""genius"" levels. I take that to mean it's some sort of multiplier or a set upgrade that does more the smart you are already.

The other thing though. . . .I'm just not sure what I would do with all of that. Think about what someone who has all scientific data collected, **ever**. It's. . .how do even. . .? This is one of the *standard* powers Mewtwo hands out?

Think about the smartest science person you know and what they accomplished. Now, think about how that person dedicated most of their life to become that smart and that good at what they did. Here's the kicker, **I know everything they know already and I'm probably smarter than them too**. No matter who you imagined, I know everything they know and I'm close or higher than their intellect. Einstein? **Everything**. Stephen Hawking? **Everything**. Biology, physics, medicine, **everything**.

. . .I'm not sure the person who originally made this knew the gravity of that wording.

. . .

I'd probably start with a few *cures* for different cancers, not sure which ones. After accomplishing that with the help of some fellow disciples, I think I'll move on to making a game. A spectacular game that will not only make people happy to play, it will fucking teach them in a bunch of subtle ways.

I want to make a legendary game, instant smash success type legendary that will be talked about and played for years. It will be designed in a way that all the progression is somehow keyed to learning about various subjects. Everything will be presented in a way people can understand, even if they're bad at the subject or just not bright to begin with.

Depending on interests, you could learn about all sorts of things, progress in different ways and gain new abilities befitting your interests.

I might return to normal science stuff and try to genetically engineer some super foods for impoverished nations and stuff. I might write some books at some point too. Not like biographies or science books or something like that, but fantasy and and action and sci-fi novels. Something people would read for fun.

You guess it, they would also somehow make people learn without boring people to death. Whether in game, novel or any other entertainment, everything I create with subtly teach people. It's sneaky and ambitious, but I think I can pull it off with the gifts and support I'm given. ",4,Deltabeat,True,t3_29cm3w,0,cijnmcr,0,1434450154,

At one point, the characters build their very own dungeon and have to defend it against heroes. Simply retext and work with it. Use the hirelings as an organization, establish them a main base, and allow them to take bonuses and special actions once a week towards specific goals: collecting materials, recruiting more members, espionage, etc.

In the meantime, allow them to build traps, defenses, and special units of soldiers. These will boost their ability to have their organization perform side missions that are less important but may bring in gold and items. Give the base ""Security Points"" and have missions and attacks occur based on this. Find a group of well known soldiers that are pissed off and ready for payback? Station them and gain a security point. Kill off that behemoth that was wrecking shit and regenerating? Send it back to the alchemists to see if they can make something out of it, security point from armor that gives your mooks fast healing and makes them more effective in combat.
