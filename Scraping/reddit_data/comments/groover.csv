Crappy groovers will make your life miserable.And they are real tricky to sharpen, so better quality ones generally deliver better results.

Bevelers on the other hand are relatively easy to strop and get sharp, so I get cheaper ones like these.

Notes:  
1.	I did not put leather stamps on here but know this, you don’t need that many. Starting out you can get by with a couple basket weave stamps, seeders, camouflage stamps, veiners, bevelers, shaders (maybe 3-5 or each).  And buy good stamps, I know it’s enticing to buy those 25-piece sets of Chinese stamps… Don’t. Most are dull and leave terrible details. Spend the extra money and get good quality stamps like these . The difference is NIGHT and DAY. Crappy stamps will make you quit the hobby. Also get a piece of granite to stamp on. It helps prevent stamp bounce and double strikes, requires less force, and the detail is much better.  
2.	A note on casing (wetting leather prior to tooling “stamping” it). Everyone has their own voodoo art to it. I simply spray water on the leather till it soaks to about the middle, then let the tooling surface air dry back to the color it was when you started (before spraying). There’ll be plenty of water in it. Also, apply painter’s tape to the opposite side you will be tooling, this keeps the leather from stretching. Leather stretches a LOT if you don’t do this as well as deforms and cups.  
3.	Can’t think of anything to practice, cut apart old leather things you have and use them as a pattern.  
4.	Buy bags of scrap leather to practice on.  
5.	Read up on types of leather, their uses and weights, this will help you pick the right leather and weight for your project.  
6.	Use your dividers to layout straight stitches, you can see crooked stitches from orbit.  
7.	Use the right weight thread and the right stitch spacing for the job. Leave the fine stitches to the machine. 4mm stitch spacing with 0.8mm thread and 5mm stitch spacing with 1.0mm thread (that’s what I like).   
8.	Know when to use a beveler and when it’s not necessary.  
9.	Always slick the edges that need it.   
10.	Radiused corners are “generally” nicer to look at.  
11.	There are other colors than black.  
12.	Someday get an airbrush, gradients are easier, dye goes further, and finish is generally more even.  
13.	Get a lacing pony at some point (I designed and 3D printed one for myself)  
14.	Practice your lacing (watch videos on it).

11. There are other colors than black.&lt;br/&gt;
12. Someday get an airbrush, gradients are easier, dye goes further, and finish is generally more even.&lt;br/&gt;
13. Get a lacing pony at some point (I designed and 3D printed one for myself)&lt;br/&gt;
14. Practice your lacing (watch videos on it).  &lt;/p&gt;

I sang and wrote poetry/melodic lines since I was a kid. Took classical lessons (which did not really speak to my interests at all) until I graduated high school. Logical thing from there (since my education was being paid for by my grandmother and parents) was to take my mom's advice and study classical voice at a very prestigious uni. Which I hated. It was the worst time in my life. I almost didn't survive the experience (literally). It was extremely competitive, judgmental, rule-focused, perfectionistic, and I found the genre to be white supremist in nature. While I was there I also studied piano, guitar, and numerous other instruments, by then end of the degree thinking I sucked at all of them more than I did before I entered.

  
After about seven years of recovery from that toxic, awful experience, I had taken some production courses and had created a collection of ideas for songs (relatively diverse in genre but under the umbrella of art pop). 

I started to play open mics (just me, a pedal, and a guitar) and booked 4 or 5 gigs with some friends I'd met at an open mic who are in a 2 piece band.

In the past year, I met with several producers to find out who could help me bring my songs to a more professional level and create an album. I found one who worked on a single with me for about 2 months and it turned out fantastic. Then he moved 2 hours away. After having spent $750 on another producer in the area who barely touched my music and considered the project finished, I decided to go back to the first guy, having to make 2 hour one-way commutes for every recording session.  
We're almost finished the album now and it feels great.

&amp;#x200B;

2. What are the main challenges you've faced in gaining recognition in the music industry?

I haven't found much success so far. 

I've used Groover to get some recognition and I can't say much about the success yet because they all got back to me and added me to their playlists but the impact on my stats has been minimal in the weeks since that occurred. It's too early to tell. 

I've tried selling merch to gain recognition but with tshirt prices and the economy being so out of whack, I've only had close friends and family make purchases so far (within 2 months of starting to sell).

I find people are not as excited about and committed to musical artists as they used to be, in general. It feels like we're more of a dime a dozen commodity now. 

I tried submitting my professionally produced single (which my producer was even excited about long after I'd paid him the money)  to a contest, but no dice. 

People don't seem too overexcited about my insta either. I'm looking to make funny/ artsy videos to attract more viewers.

  
3. How do you currently market your music, and what has or hasn't worked for you?

  
Besides streaming platforms, see above.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Where do you usually find opportunities to showcase your work, and how do you self-promote?

  
I make my own artwork for the music. I designed the tshirts and the single art and I'm designing the album cover.

  
4. What's been your experience with existing platforms for emerging artists, and what features do you find helpful or missing?

  
It's been fine overall, though I think they're raping us financially. They should be paying us more than a fraction of a cent per listen, with payout at minimum $10.

  
5. Which marketing tools or strategies have been most effective for expanding your audience?

  
Releasing a professional single and telling people about it via socials.   


6. How do you connect with your fans, and what challenges do you face in maintaining that connection?

  
I sell merch and have insta. It's hard when you do (almost) everything yourself so I wish I could engage with them more.

  
7. Have you collaborated with other artists, and if so, how do you usually go about it?

  
Yes. I started to play open mics (just me, a pedal, and a guitar) and booked 4 or 5 gigs with some friends I'd met at an open mic who are in a 2 piece band. We never played songs together but they always lent me their equipment.

  
8. What methods or platforms do you prefer for engaging with and growing your fan base?

  
Instagram. It's supposed to be fairly reliable and one time I got 7000 views on just a simple video of me dancing and singing. 

  
9. In your opinion, what's lacking in terms of support or resources for emerging artists in the current music industry?

Point blank, streaming platforms who rake in probably countless millions per year should be paying out artists way more than they do. If they paid a just a dollar a stream, I'd have earned 649 dollars  in the last year from Spotify alone. Even half of that would be nice. 

Government grants take forever to access. I'm thankful to have been able to borrow money from family and save up from my day job to fund my music (my producer alone costs $70/hour and the album will have cost approx. 5-7000 by the end).  

I find that music feels very wild-west ish because you're basically on your own.

Primeiro um dos motivos de eu ter gostado do ep, é porque o submundo é sempre minha parte preferida em obras desse estilo e PJO n é diferente. apesar de ficar triste de não terem feio o submundo corporativo, desde o começo não vemos as adaptações modernas empresariais tão forte, então ainda fiquei impressionado pelos cenários do submundo.

Outro motivo, é que a adaptação de algumas mudanças se comparado aos livros, ainda são pra mim, bem interessantes, como a Annabeth sendo presa por seus arrependimentos e ela ser tirada antes, além da Sally invocando e conversando com o ex, são momentos que trazem pra mim que leu os livros, novas adaptações que enriquecem o mundo e as historias. 

MAASSSSS, lá vem as criticas da temporada inteira, que são aparentes nesse episodio, pra mim são dois grandes problemas que trazem as problemáticas da serie, o primeiro é falta de tempo/orçamento, eu sei que ser a primeira temp não ajuda a ter muito renome, já que faz anos que não temos algo de PJO, mas os 8 episódios de 30-40 min, ajudam a diluir muitas situações e detalhes para serem rapidas, o fato das crianças serem super sagazes e descobrirem os perigos, é claramente uma forma do episodio andar rápido, e eles não ficarem presos no problema a um nível de episodio inteiro. Assim a obra trabalha outros aspectos que focam mais nas narrativas, como o Hermes e o Luke, ou a Sally e o Percy.

Essa necessidade de andar e fazer valer cada segundo, traz a falta de muitos complementos dos livros, que seriam sim interessantes, como o acampamento e seu funcionamento interno, como os chalés e casa maior se comporta, momentos que seriam muito apreciados, mas se perdem na correria.

E o segundo maior defeito, que pra mim é realmente o que faz a serie pecar é a direção. Igual foi falado pela Giovana, as pessoas que estão dirigindo a serie estão completamente inertes, todo episodio tem o mesmo tom do inicio ao fim, não a uma grande diferença entre as cenas, você não consegue sentir mudanças de tom no decorrer do episodio porque a direção não trabalha com o que eles tem. Usando de exemplo a medusa, o fato deles descobrirem que ela é a medusa rápido, pra mim não é um problema (assim como foi nos próximos eps, eu vejo como uma escolha narrativa deles serem bem espertos), o problema é que quando é necessário a construção de tensão quando eles discordam dela nas conversas da mesa e da cozinha, não é bem feito. Você não sente a tensão aumentando, você não sente as coisas complicando no tom cinematográfico, você sente pelas falas, mas só as falas não conseguem fazer bem o sentimento, falta a Anna mais desesperada ou o groover batendo o pé.

Não a ideias de construir cenas diferentes, todas as cenas são iguais em tom do começo ao fim, a serie tem muita narrativa e momentos pra mudanças, mas a direção não trabalha de formas eficientes, eu sinto sempre que as mudanças no âmbito narrativo funcionam, a serie segue com a mesma historia e acrescenta pro futuro no tempo que tem, mas no âmbito cinematográfico, elas ficam paradas, inertes no automático, onde os fãs que queriam mais das cenas, ficam putos pela falta e vão descontar na narrativa. (Não que seja perfeita as mudanças, até agora não tenho certeza do fato deles terem perdido o prazo, mas eu acho que narrativamente a muitos mais acertos do que erros.)

Claro, não só são esses os problemas gerais que podem ser criticados, como também tem as lutas fracas, mas os outros problemas podem ser englobados nesses dois grandes, que TEM quer ser melhorados na próximas temporadas.

That's really impressive. A few ideas for things to look into doing next below. Also, just to put it out there, being an original music outfit these days is insanely hard, and there's so much more to it than just playing music. Seems like you've already got your shit together a bit, but if you're serious about this, be prepared for a lot of work on things that seems pretty stupid and unrelated to music at all, like replying to every comment on your first 100 tiktoks or whatever. That's just a part of the game these days.

\-Like everyone is saying, get on TikTok. It's the only platform with an algorithm that actually puts new content in front of users—most other platforms require your content to already have shown engagement potential before they'll field it to new viewers—which is why it seems like all the new viral artists are from TikTok. That said, this is ABSOLUTELY NOT a sure-fire way to go viral—it's more possible on TikTok than other platforms, but it's still incredibly unlikely, and everyone who thinks it's anywhere close to a sure thing is being influenced by the survivorship bias of only seeing the 1/1000000 success stories. So, like, you should do it, but don't get discouraged if you don't go viral quickly.

\-Sub-point: on TikTok, do as many trends as you can. There's no way to ensure a viral video, but if you use a trend that everyone else is already looking at or do an open-verse challenge with a successful artist, it's more likely. 

\-If your music is not on Spotify, get it on there (as well as the other DSPs, but mainly spotify), and if you have any resources at your disposal, use services to promote your music to appropriate independent Spotify curators. Look for platforms that pitch you to independent curators (Groover is the big one of which I'm aware, but there are lots of little genre-specific ones that come and go all the time). You do NOT want the services that allow you to buy streams—Spotify has been getting way more hardcore about docking streams and even kicking artists off of the platform for bot streams. Independent playlist promotion is higher cost per stream and no guaranteed stream count, but it's higher-quality engagement. 

\-A note on stats: spotify sucks, yeah, but if you want to break into the music industry, spotify stream numbers and tiktok followers are the two most important numbers out there. Many industry folks look at these numbers before they even listen to your music. Depressing and frustrating, yeah. But, that's the way it is—if you love and believe in your music, which it seems like you do, these are just a part of the process. 

\-I don't know what the deal with New Zealand booking agencies is, but here in the US, there's sort of a rule that, if you're able to sell out small rooms in 3 separate markets (like, 100 cap), that's when agents will start looking at you. It's very much not hard-and-fast, but that's definitely a turning point. If your band isn't there yet, keep looking for show opportunities in new markets to build and prove those accolades. If you are there, consider emailing a few independent agencies contact-us pages; I wouldn't necessarily ask that they take you on, but if you ask them for advice on how to make yourselves marketable to an agency, well, everyone loves being asked for their expertise. At best, they'll take a look and consider taking you in; at minimum, they'll give you tips for how to be more marketable; and at worst, they won't respond, and you'll have sent one useless email.

\-Try to get to know the pillars of the music scene in whatever your city is. There are probably more opportunities here than you realize. If you get to know the local non-for-profit radio program director, he'll probably do an album release segment for you on the air; if you get to know the promoter for the city's 1000 cap club, next time a national touring act comes through and needs local direct support, you might be the person they call. It takes a while to build those relationships, but they're good to have. 

\-If you've got some resources, consider pooling them and going in for a 3-6 month campaign with a publicist. There are a lot of price ranges for publicity out there; I'd recommend looking for someone in the 500-2000/month range, and only go with a publicist who you meet with and get along well with, and who you can find good recommendations for. It's very much about finding the right person for you and your band; I would recommend against someone who just takes the check and opens their roledex. You want someone who you like personally and who seems to geniunely like your music. There are so many opportunities that you don't even know exist that a publicist can connect you with—online blogs with a few hundred followers, weird special-interest festivals that want to associate themselves with new bands to seem hip, industry showcase concert series, connections with other sides of the music industry like synch licensing, etc. A few notes, though:

1: Publicists are expensive, and some of them suck. Only do this if you have the money and find the right person.

2: Many higher-end publicists might not take you seriously unless you have a manager. If you have one, great. If not, you can look for one. Even more so than with a publicist, finding a manager is about finding the right person; this is the person who is your liaison with the music industry, who's supposed to be fighting for your interests with every one of the other parties you work with. It doesn't necessarily need to be someone from a management agency; it can just be someone who you trust, who believes in your music, and who has a good work ethic. Learning on the job is a must for the music industry anyway, since it changes so quickly.

3: Publicists are somewhat limited by what you're doing during the campaign. If you decide to pay the big bucks for a publicist, try to line up the time period of the campaign with some big shows, and a few single and video releases, and an album, and a label contract signing, and etc etc. The more you do, the more they can do for you.

There are a lot of price ranges for publicity out there; I&amp;#39;d recommend looking for someone in the 500-2000/month range, and only go with a publicist who you meet with and get along well with, and who you can find good recommendations for. It&amp;#39;s very much about finding the right person for you and your band; I would recommend against someone who just takes the check and opens their roledex. You want someone who you like personally and who seems to geniunely like your music. There are so many opportunities that you don&amp;#39;t even know exist that a publicist can connect you with—online blogs with a few hundred followers, weird special-interest festivals that want to associate themselves with new bands to seem hip, industry showcase concert series, connections with other sides of the music industry like synch licensing, etc. A few notes, though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1: Publicists are expensive, and some of them suck. Only do this if you have the money and find the right person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2: Many higher-end publicists might not take you seriously unless you have a manager. If you have one, great. If not, you can look for one. Even more so than with a publicist, finding a manager is about finding the right person; this is the person who is your liaison with the music industry, who&amp;#39;s supposed to be fighting for your interests with every one of the other parties you work with. It doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily need to be someone from a management agency; it can just be someone who you trust, who believes in your music, and who has a good work ethic. Learning on the job is a must for the music industry anyway, since it changes so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3: Publicists are somewhat limited by what you&amp;#39;re doing during the campaign. If you decide to pay the big bucks for a publicist, try to line up the time period of the campaign with some big shows, and a few single and video releases, and an album, and a label contract signing, and etc etc. The more you do, the more they can do for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck! Best wishes for you and the other double jumps.&lt;/p&gt;

I've lived in a couple rave centers over the years (florida during breaks, nyc during electro revival/whatever nyc is up to, been in l.a. for a while so seen the scene grow), and VERY generally L.A. is just not much of a \~dance\~ town. I don't know why. Maybe big U.S. cities have a too-cool thing that leads to self-consciousness (I encountered it a bit in NYC tho not as much). But I dunno about that because people in, say, Montreal or Mexico City dance like crazy. Perhaps it's our proximity to fame, and being conscious that everyone is judging everyone here, and not wanting to seem like a certified freek. 

A little less generally, but still generally, hetero spaces tend to be less \~dance-y\~ as do overly white spaces. I love Certified Groovers, but I wouldn't say it's a queer party (this isn't a criticism, like I said, I love CG, but it's kind of an old-head party lol). Us queers had to break out of being self-conscious about our identity so maybe that makes us more likely to let loose.

People said this before, but the music makes a big difference. This kinda deep house is more cerebral thing, bob-your-head more than work it out, though that also depends on the DJ. Also if the speakers are clear and loud and the sub is throbbing, that helps.

Also, L.A. is blessed and cursed with space. I was in Montreal over the summer at a tiny club and it was packed with people and everyone was grooving on top of each other, and if you elbowed someone you just said ""pardon."" Warehouses are big and rarely packed in a good way. People are used to their personal space here, being in our cars all day, working from home, not talking to anyone. If you accidentally brush someone, it's taken as a personal affront.

Lastly, I think it, more than anything, comes down to the lighting. This is true for anywhere in the world. Certified Groovers is sometimes an afternoon daytime party. No one is gonna freek in the broad daylight.

\- **better playlist management:** more comprehensive smartlists with way more options (including filtering based on presence in other playlists, which was a huge gap when i moved from (then) itunes to serato for management. multi-selecting playlists to move or delete

\- **music discovery/purchase:** you can import spotify playlists and have it automatically search against your library to see what is already there. you can add a playlist and automatically search which music stores have it and the cost of each. you can create discovery playlists from music in your library, compare/merge playlists, and more. it makes parts of discovery and prep that took hours take minutes (and a coffee break since store search can understandably take a while)

\- **the phucking PHONE APP:** i have considered switching to rekordbox just so i could listen to and prep my dj music on the go. the app is in beta and still has quirks but already has let me speed through a thousand or so songs of rating/tagging on the go in less than a week. i don't know that i'd use it to set/name my cues and loops since the desktop app is better for that, but it's the perfect interface for star/energy/etc rating and tagging and i think actually better than the desktop app for those tasks.

Also key to this perceived zolo aesthetic is a theatrical flair indebted to Cabaret and the quirky Progressive Rock of Gentle Giant, along with a Zappa-esque sense of humour. The term has also been used to refer to a corresponding visual aesthetic with neon colours and sharp, jagged graphic objects, which prominently features in these artists' album covers and posters; the term itself comes from a 1980s toy company whose products mirror this aesthetic.*

*Early artists Sharkie identified with the term include more Progressive Pop and Glam Rock influenced artists like early Sparks, Split Enz, and Godley &amp; Creme, but the advent of punk and new wave would shift his focus towards the wide ranging sounds of Devo's Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo! (1978) and British bands like XTC and Cardiacs that incorporated the energy of 2 Tone into Art Punk and post-punk, and later groups like They Might Be Giants and Stump with similar oddball appeal. The term has also gained some traction to describe the quirkier side of 1980s Japanese new wave, with Moonriders, the Devo-like P-Model, the Minimal Synth-oriented ピッキーピクニック [Picky Picnic], and sometimes more experimental artists like Wha-Ha-Ha being of interest to American zolo aficionados.*

Lyrics:

Ratification of the E.R.A.
Recruiting poster beckons:
""See Mandalay!""
Sign the papers, shots
Pack ready to go
Now I'm a boy in the U.S.O.

Ballroom dancing
Propaganding
News from stateside
Free Jeep ride

I'm not a yum yum boy
Like those in Zagreeb
I really go for girls
In Army fatigues
Strictly professional
I'm no easy lay
I could talk about
Howitzers all day

Punch and movies
Non-com smoothies
Khaki sweaters
Dear Jane letters

Discussing strategy
With General Jean
Arm wrestling with
A lady marine
Black market nylons
Baby, give me your dough
Now I'm a boy in the U.S.O.
Go!

[Instrumental Break]

Little Chinese boys they
Run to my side
Say ""Mister how about
You give me a ride""
I smile and throw some change
For the world to know
WE'RE NOT CHEAP HERE IN THE U.S.O.

And the thread will wear on the tightly folded corner, making the product less robust.

I do a different order of operations than it looks like you are following.  
First make and glue your internal pockets to internal shell.  Mark the vertical stitch line for the inside edge of your pockets with wing dividers, and punch your holes (you want to stop punching 1 hole before where your bottom edge horizontal stitches will eventually sit (one of those punched on a different orientation will make your stitch line look funky).   I don't connect the internal vertical with the external horizontal lines.   If you try to do so, the changed orientation of the holes from vertical to horizontal could make your final stitch look like it isn't straight.  Use your wing dividers and punches to identify one hole above where the horizontal stitch line will eventually go, or you can eyeball it. 

When you have marked and punched the interior vertical lines, if you have a stitch groover you can groove the back of the stitch line, this allows the stitches to settle in and not stick out into the bill compartment.  I stitch these internal verticals from the bottom and only backstitch at the top end for structural strength  of the pocket entry. Use a hammer/roller/bone folder to flatten your stitch line.  Whatever you have/prefer.
If you are lining, now is the time to attach any backing liner to the interior structure.

Once this is done on both sides, glue the outer shell to one side only.  Mark and punch your stitch holders from the bottom to make the L shaped connection of the bottom and side edges.  (Make sure that your exterior corners are punched in the correct orientation - the stitch hole(s) should slant the corner as opposed to point into it).  
When you have stitched that, mark out your stitch line on the other side (from the inside).
Fold the wallet closed, keep a comfortable tension on the outer shell and when you are comfortable with this motion make a discreet mark where the outer sheep lines up with the inside edge of the unconnected card pocket.  Use that to know where to glue and connect the remaining side of the wallet once glued open the wallet and punch your stitch holes and stitch up the final side of the wallet. Trim off any excess length you had on the exterior shell.

I have a country property and my friends in town would hate if I drove on their yard let alone mow it.  I also have a zero turn.  It&amp;#39;s an old snapper that I put atv tires on to mow the hills and the dam of the pond.  I also bought a tire groover to cut my r4s for more traction in the snow.&lt;/p&gt;

1. a cutting mat
2. a cutting tool - round knife is ideal, but a xacto blade works for thinner leathers too
3. ruler
4. a groover / push creaser
5. a marker wheel for stitch locations
6. a diamond awl (much cheaper and more versatile than good pricking irons)
7. a cork block (awl needs to go somewhere when stabbing holes)
8. an edge beveler, size 2 is usually a good starting point, I still rarely ever need 1 or 3
9. saddler's needles - longer, thicker, blunt
10. thread(s) -if possible get a woven one, not spun. Much better to work with. Also polyester is a good material choice, natural threads are good too, but require more wax
11. beeswax, both for edge finishing and for the thread before stitching
12. a wooden edge slicker
13. adhesive, I recommend some kind of barge, but there are good water based leather glues as well

This is all you'd need to put together the first projects; be it belts, bags, wallets, they can be made withi the tools listed above.

Leathers:

1. veg tan cowhide: around 1mm thickness for inner pockets of wallets and similar applications; 2-2.5mm for outer shells of wallets, small goods, bags, belts if you make it with two layers; 3mm also still bags, now nearing single layer belt territory; 4mm singe layer belts, straps, collars, that kind of stuff
2. chrome tan cowhide: any application where softness is important, but where you can mostly hide edges; think handbags  
3. goat: wallets and linings of other projects

there are many different leathers, all with slightly different attributes and aesthetics; depending on the projects you have in mind, you can definitely find something that checks all the boxes. Or you choose a material that looks just great to you and choose appropriate projects.  

If you want to try tooling:

1. swivel knives: a thin one for contours, a thick one for decorative cuts
2. a tooling hammer, usually with a heavy nylon/rubber/leather covered head to protect the tools
3. bevelers for contours, one narrow (around 2mm wide)for details, one wide (4mm maybe) to cover distance more quickly
4. backgrounder, one big for larger areas, one small for narrow areas, both of the same pattern if possible
5. wax paper
6. a blunt metal tipped pen to transfer drawing from the paper to the leather (draw with pencil on paper, trace final version onto wax paper, put wax paper on wet leather and trace drawing with metal pen)
7. a modeling spoon to smooth over edges left after tooling

There are many many many more different tools available, but those are special and not absolutely necessary unless you want to do any kind of western tooling style, like Sheridan or Arizona flowering.  

Good brands to pick tools from are Barry King, Craft Japan, and some by Hide Crafter.

&lt;p&gt;I mean, not if it&amp;#39;s going to get you killed. IDK how strict things are there you could do man in the street videos where you play your music for people, even if they&amp;#39;re plants, but they can react in different ways. That could be entertaining, in the West at least. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think people in the west would love to see you use your local culture fused with your music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do shit like that, grow your social, carries over to your spotify/YT and there you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is predicated on you:&lt;/p&gt;

En la materia ""introducción a la ingeniería mecánica"" se ve el proceso de diseño mecánico y se usa el libro *The mechanical design process* (Ullman). No cursé esta materia así que no lo puedo recomendar. 

Si te interesan los materiales, *Ciencia e Ingeniería de los Materiales* (Callister) es una muy buena introducción. En particular, el capítulo de propiedades mecánicas es el primer paso para entender cómo y por qué se rompen las cosas. Yo empezaría con este.

*Fundamentos de manufactura moderna* (Groover) es una introducción a procesos de fabricación industrial (mecanizado, fundición, inyección, etc).

Si te interesa saber cuánta carga aguanta una estructura, *Mecanica de Materiales* (Gere) es el libro que se usa en estática. Tené en cuenta que no es una lectura muy ""divertida"" porque es como leer un libro de física. Además este libro es para una materia de segundo año, muchas de las fórmulas salen de tomar diferenciales de material y realizar una integral, no vas a entender muy bien qué está haciendo.  Podés ojearlo un poco para ver las formas básicas de fallo, pero no te lo recomiendo como introducción. (La mecánica de materiales viene después de ciencia de materiales).

*Diseno En Ingenieria Mecanica de Shigley* tiene de todo, es básicamente un libro sobre cómo dimensionar lleno de fórmulas, pero no es introductorio (se da en materias de 3° año).

1. Grind social media. Post every single day to TikTok or YT shorts. Content has to be something people want to watch that just happens to have your music in it.  If it's just you playing your songs it will die. I mean, you might get 1000 views but that's not going to translate into anything meaningful on spotify. Do this everyday.
2. Play live. Grind this till you get to the point where you can get shows where people actually care to see you and the audience isn't already filled with your family and friends.
3. Playlisting. You basically pitch your songs to playlists and hope they get placed. You can do that on submit hub or groover (there's probably more)

What I did was, when you upload your song on distrokid (if you do it long enough in advance) you can pitch to spotify playlists.

You won't always get on, but when you do it's almost a guaranteed couple thousand streams with saves and adds to their playlists. That will in turn result in a about 10% of that audience listening to your other tracks. So if one of my song gets 2000 streams I usually see about 200 or 300 on the other songs off the EP.

I got one song added and then without even trying it was added to a bunch of other playlists that get streams. It had a bunch of streams until I got booted off that list. Now it gets a few hundred streams a week from other smaller lists that added it. I did nothing but pitch it when it was released.

Distrokid also offers a place where you can search for playlists to pitch too.

I release about three songs a month and pitch one out of the 3 of them. I'd say one every other month makes it somewhere.

With that said, you have to have music that is STRAIGHT down the middle.

Russian Alt Folk Metal with hip hop roots isn't going to have many playlist opportunities, though the ONE playlist for that shit is going to LOVE YOU.

I produce a few different styles but they're all pretty easily categorized in their genre.  

I also write for that. I don't make long songs, long intros...but that's what I'm into and I like to listen to.

With that, absolutely NONE of this is going to get you anywhere.

I do this cause I love it.

IDK what your goals are but unless you are going to grind... and I mean REALLY grind short form videos on TikTok or YT... you know the ones. Where a dude plays one song on 18 different guitars so you can compare tones, or re-record and produce compelling covers or make your cat dance while you play a song... or teach people something, or some other schtick....you're too far behind the curve. Having good music isn't enough. Audiences want a multi media experience. It's not enough to have one or two good videos, you need a whole channel of content to get follows. Sure, maybe your friends will and random people like you who are just starting, but they're not really fans. 

From time to time guys will pop up on the reddit boards and taut the benefits of TikTok; go check out there stuff and they have like 400 followers and are posting goofy shit I simply do not want to do. 

The conversion from TikTok or YT follower to Apple Music or Spotify subs is abysmal...like 1%. You'd need a ton of video followers to translate to anything meaningful on spotify especially since they're requiring 1000 streams to pay out anything. 

Make no mistake; if you talked to a marketing pro they would say that is the 100% way...and they are correct. 

But unless you are desperate for attention or this is your single only option for making money there is way better use of your time.

Not trying to be a defeatist. 

You can use sites like Submit hub or Groover to get on legit playlists.

You have to pay a 'credit' to submit but they're actual playlists that have actual listeners. You will get rejected, a lot, because the curators aren't always 100% clear what they want... but you can also get some people to listen to your tunes so you're not uploading into a void.

You can use leather cement or  double-sided leather tape to secure the pockets, and then use a groover to make perfect lines for stitching. (Use credit cards on L and currency on R to get the stitching/pocket just right)&lt;/p&gt;

Of course, it helps to have a label backing you (even small indie ones), as they often have connects at these DSPs and can get your song to the right ear. This is particularly how you see artists with little to no audience and nothing released get their first releases on editorials. 

That being said, I know people who’ve gotten placements on official playlists with self-released tracks just by pitching through Spotify for Artists (no equivalent for Apple yet). I can tell you with complete certainty that your profile on Spotify doesn’t matter all that much - the quality of your pictures, what you write in your bio, pretty much irrelevant. 

Your music counts. Make it good and release it as consistently as you can. When you’re pitching, give a good description of the track, say where you’re based, and feel free to suggest a couple of fitting playlists. 

Spotify used to be more of a level playing field. I remember when you could contact curators directly through google forms. Unfortunately not the case anymore, due both to over-saturation and a lot of major label involvement with DSPs. Not to mention them blindly favouring whatever is going viral on TikTok and Insta right now. 

Don’t sleep on indie playlists and blogs. I would not recommend sites like PlaylistPush or Groover (as someone who’s been a curator). Just not a fan, and seems pretty low value. Submithub works and is my favourite of these types of sites. Again, make sure your description and profile is up to date, and submit to the right places - blogs included. Write ups (and sites like Hype Machine) used to be more important, but they still hold some value. 

Best of luck, don’t stop what you’re doing just because of a lack of attention from Spotify and the like. This industry isn’t easy and thrives on personal connections. But it’s really about the music, don’t forget that. 

Hope that was of some help!

Fantastic work for your first try! Here are a few tips:  


1. Work on your stitching line. It's not straight and appears wavy.
2. Consider buying a leather compass and a leather stitch groover; they will be a big help.
3. Take your time when stitching, ensuring the flow and tension are even with each step. If they aren't, redo the stitch.
4. Sand down all your edges using 400-1000ish grit. This should give you a nearly mirror-clean edge.

* For Example: sand with 200, then 400 then 600 then 800 then 1000. At 400 dry sand then take your finger and wet it and apply water on the edge. Dry sand 👉wet sand,👉 water/tokonole mix sand.  

* Do this these all the way to 1000. At 1000, use pure tokonole and sand one more time. Then apply a little Tokonole and buff it with a cloth.  

* Practice the edge steps with scrap leather. Glue a few pieces together with adhesive, cut them with a fine blade, and then practice sanding from 200 to 1000 grit.

Thank you for this message and long analysis of your results on Groover!

* First of all, I went to check your results, and I could see that your music was accepted 175 times out of 729 submissions, that's a **24% acceptance rate** which is quite impressive. The average on Groover is around 20%. I'm not sure I understand when you say that your music is almost never added to playlists... Your music actually gets shared quite a lot, and more than the average! 
* I can also see some of the top playlists in the ""Discovered On"" section of your Spotify profile being playlists you submitted to on Groover (like chillyourmind, XINCLAIR, Music Connoisseur etc.)
* By the way, chillyourmind is extremely selective (only 2% acceptance rate) so hats off on being share by him 🙌🙌🙌
* I also had a look at the replies from the curators whose screenshots you added to your post. These are **particularly selective curators** who still share tracks and have impact. Average acceptance rate on Groover is **over 20%**, many curators are less selective than the ones you display in your post. Being shared by these ones is a true mark of success, not being shared doesn't mean your music is not good, they're super selective about what they share, getting rejected in this situation is actually pretty normal:
   * Larsen Blake is indeed very selective (which is displayed on his profile), he accepts only **3%** of the submissions received. He only accepts tracks on which he has a huge crush on and correspond to his playlist
   * Zollim is a bit less selective, accepting **8%** of the tracks received (out of more than 1,200 submissions received so far, which means **96 tracks shared**)
   * Sad Sounds is one the most selective curators on Groover with a **1%** acceptance rate, they have a huge impact when they share though!
* Appreciation of music genres is as subjective as music tastes themselves, feedback will always be 100% subjective and depending on what the curator likes and wants to share in that moment. The curators &amp; pros need to remain free to share or not your music, that's how they have value, that's how getting shared means something :) Like with chillyourmind for instance!
* For sure, some curators will write more relevant feedback than others, and we monitor this closely. We plan recurring audits, and there's one planned for Q4! That being said, the feedback you displayed in your post respects our guidelines. Curators are free to be selective as long as they explain why they're not sharing. These curators are super impactful AND selective, which explains why small details can decide them not to share. I can understand how frustrating this can be, but you can also celebrate victories when one of them shares your music!
* All of this to say that I believe you got great results, your targeting may improve now that you know the platform better so the return on your investment should become even better with further campaigns. When you get feedback that doesn't bring value, I'd strongly advise you to not consider it too much. Feedback is first and foremost here as a **proof of listening**, we tried removing it in the past but it was a complete disastor, curators were sharing 4 times less, as not having to give feedback kind of withdrew them from really considering whether they wanted to share the track or not
* This is really cool that you were able to grow your audience also through ads, Andrew Southworth is a really good source to improve your strategy on this topic, but you probably already know him and his YouTube channel :)
* Finally, your post title ""The Truth about Groover"" is a bit too much in my opinion, and a clickbait. I must admit it's a bit hurtful, even though I respect your opinion of course. It's more **your** truth about Groover, and the comments/debate that followed is super interesting, shows very different points of view. It's also a bit contradictory with the very essence of your message. Indeed, when a curator says that they don't want to share your track or give feedback, it doesn't mean it's the absolute truth, it's only their opinion (thank God 😅). It's the same in your case here, as you can see through this all conversation and thread.

I wish you the best for your music and project, feel free to reach out to [support@groover.co](mailto:support@groover.co) if you have any questions or would like us to make some recommendations of curators for you to reach out to. You got GREAT results on Groover, I assure you. And I believe they'll get even better over time. But I also understand if you don't want to use the platform again, that's your choice.

All the best,

What you seem to be looking for - correct me if I'm wrong - is the potential exposure these curators can give to you in case they appreciate your track.

The fact that Groover works with micro-payments already brings more responsibility to the table. Artists tend to be more careful about who they reach out to, the curators receive music that is closer to what they want to receive, which contributes to having less saturation than with the traditional email system. Thanks to this, curators can listen to the tracks and consider sharing them, which they don't with emails. 

On your side, instead of sending hundreds of emails and getting 0 replies, you get guaranteed replies from a more limited number of curators YOU've selected. The average acceptance rate on Groover - e.g. a curator decides to do more than just give feedback - is on average superior to 20-25%, and it varies a lot depending on the quality of the track itself and the relevance of the targeting.

&lt;p&gt;The fact that Groover works with micro-payments already brings more responsibility to the table. Artists tend to be more careful about who they reach out to, the curators receive music that is closer to what they want to receive, which contributes to having less saturation than with the traditional email system. Thanks to this, curators can listen to the tracks and consider sharing them, which they don&amp;#39;t with emails. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On your side, instead of sending hundreds of emails and getting 0 replies, you get guaranteed replies from a more limited number of curators YOU&amp;#39;ve selected. The average acceptance rate on Groover - e.g. a curator decides to do more than just give feedback - is on average superior to 20-25%, and it varies a lot depending on the quality of the track itself and the relevance of the targeting. Some tracks get accepted by 90% of the curators. This is very far from &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;10,000 tickets fo a venue that secretly holds 100&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

Stop the clocks! Roll away the stones! As rock’n’roll diehards, electric boogie fiends, old groovers and true believers have hoped for, I am delighted to confirm that the new Rolling Stones album is the best thing they have made since their Seventies glory days. Which, it might reasonably be argued, de facto makes it the best rock’n’ roll album of the past four decades at least.

Two singles have certainly whetted appetites, from the Start Me Up-jolt of Angry steamrollering over any possible objections, to the epic conclusion of righteous gospel monster Sweet Sound of Heaven reaching such heights of rapture that you might actually start to believe St Peter could welcome the old rogues through the pearly gates someday – all that bad behaviour and Sympathy for the Devil forgiven. Surely the fact that having the sainted Stevie Wonder on piano playing his multi-coloured socks off and Lady Gaga trilling away like a fallen angel is not even the best thing about it should confirm the Stones resurrection to even the most sceptical.

Let’s be fair, there have been plenty of wonderful individual tracks since the last thoroughly decent Stones album of original songs, 1981’s Tattoo You. They haven’t maintained their reputation as the world’s greatest rock’n’roll band on live shows alone, and 2016’s sinuous covers collection Blue and Lonesome confirmed that they remained masters of the blues groove. Hackney Diamonds, though, has that added magical something to elevate it above everything the Stones have released from 1983’s Undercover to 2005’s A Bigger Bang.

The dozen songs on offer are jam-packed with Jagger swagger, Keith Richards’s riffology, Ronnie Woods’s sleek solos, the Glimmer twins’ aching harmonies, abounding with tight rhythms, catchy melodies, snappy lyrics, dirty energy and all bound together with lightning flashes of hair-raising flair. They are certainly not trying to reinvent the (steel) wheel, but they do sound like they may have paid a visit to the Exile basement and reminded themselves what they are really good at. Scratch that – what they are the best in the business at.

Producer Andrew Watt has done a superb job of keeping the sound bright, crisp, loud, raucous and improbably modern. This is not the Stones at their most delicate or intricate, indeed, it is arguably simplistic to the point of being almost dumb, but then rock’n’roll doesn’t demand genius. It thrives on energy and feel, on lightning in a bottle stuff that can be desperately hard to capture with the separated recording style favoured in modern digital studios.

Watt built his reputation making records with the likes of such pop froth as Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus, but has lately been adapting contemporary techniques to freshen up the sound of vintage rockers including Ozzy Osbourne, Elton John and Iggy Pop. He has clearly been an enabling force here, taking a co-writing credit with Mick Jagger and Richards on the three opening songs, and playing bass on four (Richards and Woods both fulfil bass duties elsewhere, along with a couple of notable guests, including an old Beatle and an old Stone).

Paul McCartney pops up on Bite My Head Off, with a fuzzed-up bass solo driving through the thrilling middle of the Stones’s punkiest offering since they took on New Wave with 1978’s Some Girls. “Come on Paul, let’s hear something!” Jagger yells, just to make sure everybody notices that their old rival is in the ranks. Original Stones bassist Bill Wyman returns to reunite with the ghost of Charlie Watts on Live By the Sword, a throwaway number redeemed by that down and dirty rhythm section. The Stones’ late lamented drummer also appears on Mess it Up (one of two songs dug out of the vaults and gamely spruced up by Andrew Watt), driven by a fantastic stop-start Richards chordal riff before slipping into the sleekest Stones’ disco beat since Miss You.

It is lovely to hear those crisp Watts hi-hats in action but replacement drummer Steve Jordan (who has played on Richards solo projects since the early 90s) is on dynamic form throughout, absolutely driving through the wondrous Get Close To You, replete with a slashing Richards rhythm guitar riff and tight Jagger-Richards harmonies, with a sax solo from James King worthy of the late, great Bobby Keys. “Yeah!” Jagger can be heard purring in justified satisfaction at the end. The tinkling rhythm and blues piano comes courtesy of Elton John.

Depending on You is another winner, drawing out that Gram Parsons style country melancholy the Stones have feasted on over the years, bulked up with Hammond organ (from the Heartbreakers’ Benmont Tench) and lush strings. “I’m too young for dying and too old to lose,” croons the octogenarian front man, making 80 sound like the new 40. Dreamy Skies drifts deeper into those country plains, with the jet set Jagger improbably fantasising about being left alone with “an old AM radio” that “just plays Hank Williams and some bad honky tonk.”

Richards himself takes up the torch on Tell Me Straight, one of his lush, wise, deeply romantic ballads in which he wonders “is my future all in the past?” Not on this evidence, it isn’t. Driving Me Too Hard is another gem, with Richards and Woods’s guitars weaving gorgeously around Jagger’s sensitive vocal and closing out with big soul harmonies. The only misfire is arguably Whole Wide World, with an echoing 80s guitar and Jagger going full cockney to lament a lost past of “sex and gas” and, honestly, even that is better than almost anything the Stones actually put out in the 80s. “When you think the party’s over, it’s only just begun!” declares Jagger, and it sounds like a promise he is determined to keep.

The frontman is on utterly fantastic form throughout, never letting a vowel go unstretched or a groove go unpunctuated. Sweet Sound of Heaven is very much Jagger’s triumph – even with Wonder and Gaga on stellar form and a fantastic band pulling out all the stops, it is the ageless singer who leads the storm on heaven’s gates. It’s a track that belongs in the pantheon of the Stone’s very greatest hits.

It all ends in the sweetest possible fashion, with Jagger and Richards eyeball to eyeball, playing Muddy Waters Rolling Stone Blues on acoustic guitar and harmonica. This is the very song that gave the band their name, from an album the teenage Jagger was carrying under his arm when he bumped into old school friend Richards at Dartford Station on October 17, 1962, an encounter that set this particular stone a-rolling.

It could serve as a sentimental thank you and goodnight, a gorgeous bluesy swan song from a pair of musical rogues who’ve helped keep the world rocking for over 60 years, and a band that became the living definition of the most resonant and impactful musical genre of our times. Yet this album is just so full of life, so shot with love and energy, only a fool would bet against them doing it all again. The Stones roll on. All is well in the rock’n’roll world.

You're going to need vegetable tanned leather, the thicknesses are described in weight.  

The belt itself will be either an 8/9 ounce, or a 9/10 Oz. They carry belt blanks so unless you're looking into getting into the craft just get that.  

They also sell belt loops, just make sure they're for the same width as the belt.  It looks like a 1.5 inch belt width. You'll have to hunt around for that buckle, I've never seen one like that before.  The leg belt looks like it's a half inch strap, and you'll need a half inch brass buckle for it. 

The satchels look like 4/5 Oz. If you're looking to make it yourself you'll probably need a single shoulder. 

Leather work is a whole world. It's got a bunch of specific tools. Here are the things I see you'll need: 
* snap closure for the bag on the right.  Looks like it's probably a size line 24.
* (probably)  quarter inch silver D ring
* size medium line 20 antique brass rivets
* rivet setter
* 2mm hole punch for rivets, and probably 3 mm for belt holes 
* awl/pricking irons to make holes in leather
*waxed thread/ needles
* saddlemakers groover to make the line/ border around the edges
* Pro dye. Looks like Golden Brown to me.  Also need Dye Reducer to dilute it so you can apply it evenly
* a leather finish. Looks like it's tan kote but a lot of people swear by resoline 
* probably more but I'm on mobile and not sure if this info is what you're looking for.  

This isn't a terrible choice for a first project, but as you can see there are a lot of components to leather work and it can get expensive real fast.  

But it's super fun! Let me know if I can answer any questions

I did a short vid on those if thats of interest...or DM me direct if you like..Good luck !

&gt;First of all let me tell you that I loved your track!!  
It is way above the average quality of tracks i receive here on Groover, it belongs to that fab 10% of fab songs I receive!   
The song is pretty strong (not an hit or even a single, but solid nonetheless), your voice sounds really good (maybe a little forced in the performance at times, but its tone cuts through perfectly), the only doubts i have are regarding the production and the mix.  
The song is produced pretty well, but it seems to suffer of a certain flatness, for example when the chorus kicks in we do not get that dynamic push that we would get if, say  Chris Lord Alge had mixed it, the track kind of stays there in terms of power, and the chorus (although well written melodically) does not really happen as much as it in my opinion should. It could be a production issue, a mixing issue and/or a mastering issue - who knows, but it is certainly an issue that should have been solved before releasing the track, in my opinion.   
Also, the song seems to be a little to lightweight, a lot of high frequencies and not enough low frequency power, which makes to my ears the track a little weak, when it should be powerful and engaging.  
Another issue I’d like to mention is that the arrangement seems pretty busy (especially percussion/cymbals wise) in the area where the voice is frequency-wise, and while we can hear the voice really well, this issue brings in a certain ear-fatigue, and the song becomes a little tiring to listen to after a while, since there are too many elements craving for attention.   
So what I’d recommend here is to use an external experienced and very creative producer/mixer to help out in the future, or - if you do not want or cannot do that - to really really do anything possible to improve the strength of the production. The best way to do this is to CONSTANTLY reference the track you are working on with a track in the same genre that is successful and that you love (something by NIN, perhaps?), to check if your track has the same level of quality. Sorry if I am stating the obvious but only a ruthless and - i will repeat it - constant A/B comparison can improve one’s production and mixing efforts, and I believe this is something that you definitely should do. Also, it will be fun, hearing our productions improving in quality it is a great feeling! It takes time and effort, but the spiritual/personal rewards are immense if we love music.  
I am sorry if my feedback - which, please let me state this again, is purely my personal opinion!! - is not 100% positive, even though, as i said, I loved the track!! But I hope what i wrote will prove constructive, and that it will help you forge a path that will lead you to create even stronger tracks!!",[],,0.0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This response was absolutely insane... track was produced and mixed by an award-winning producer/engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

I think on the one hand you are absolutely right that there are many curators on groover who just want to skim the money for a short review of your song. You can often tell by the copy/paste responses you get, which contain some generalities about your song and a refusal based on taste. 

You can also see it in the numbers. There are curators who add less than 4% of submissions to their playlists and probably from people who have known them for a while.

I have made the experience that if you target medium playlists (up to 10 000 followers), you get quite good results. This way I got share rate of about 25% at groover. But, of course, they usually don't have a big impact on your streaming numbers (maybe 100 streams over time) and then you have to decide if it's worth it to you. 

What I find absolutely annoying about groover is that there are always people there who very enthusiastically promise to share your song and it just doesn't happen and the support at groover recommends you just write to the curators again. So by now I have 7 promises on my list that will probably never be fulfilled. There is simply no way to hold the curators accountable to their promise. 

Another very annoying thing on groover is, that there are curators that share your song on a playlist called ""groover selection/discoveries/blablabla"" that has 500 songs and 15 followers und you realize you just ended up on a graveyard created to earn all these nice groover credits from desperate musicians.   


What I have had very good experiences with, however, is contacting bloggers on groover. And since you said you're very active on social media, that's always nice to share and just gives you more presence, so maybe you might try that.

Of course your own targtetted marketing strategy should pay off more ( You seen Tom Dupree iii ) as you have total control over where you send promo to, and essentially if your material is in demand people will follow it regardless of Groover or anyone else.

Anyhow....I know Dorian ( the Groover guy) floats around these forums so maybe he will chip in, I can say that in my limited discussions with the Groover team there seems to be an intent at least to get the artist what they want.

That said, Im probably a small time curator in the scheme of things, but even I get a LOT of submission every week, I simply have to reject some as there not enough time, but there is clearly a business model here.

Feel free to DM me if you would like to discuss, or ...just send me a track , Good Luck with your music .

Yes. When I was taught shoemaking we were told you don’t really need a shank until you get to about 20-25mm heel height.

&gt;Should I do stitch down or welted? 

I think stitchdown is what we called veldtschoen? It’s up to you. The aesthetic is slightly different. A different amount of work and different level of “waterproof ness” for example. Stitchdown would only be one round of hand stitching whereas Goodyear would be two. 

&gt;Is neoprene contact cement good enough for all the application if I'm stitching on my outsole? 

you can make shoes solely using contact cement. So yes. it’s important to apply it properly though, I assume you know the ins and outs of that if you’ve been resoling but just in case - make sure the adhesive is thinned out enough. Apply one thin coat to both surfaces and let dry for 24h. Apply another thin coat to both surfaces and allow to dry 24h. Then heat activate both. Press together under pressure ideally for 40mins.

&gt;What's the best way to cut a thread groove into outsoles? 

using a leather groover, hand tool. I’ve found in some soling leathers it works better dry and on others it’s better wet. Or you can use a knife to cut an angled slit around the edge and then sew in there and then hammer the slit over the thread when done.

&gt;Do I need a toe stiffener if I'm doing a cap toe, and don't care about the toe shape lasting forever? 

If the toe cap is an extra layer and you don’t care about the shape forever then no  

&gt;Do I need a thermoplastic heel stiffener, or can I just use leather?

No. You can use leather. 

&gt;Which seams can I skip the skiving, if any?

None. If you do you will have unsightly bulk, and have difficulty folding seams. The toe cap doesn’t need to be skived though if it’s intentionally a top layer.

Also *Hawaiian, Lili`uokalani, Hawai`i* but still points for putting any `okina at all! 

That Hawaiian legislature was known as the Committee of Safety, made up entirely of all rich white businessmen/ministers/lawyers/foreign nationals, ran by Mr Dole Pineapple, himself. The “Hawaiian Subjects” in the group just meant they were rich white dudes born on the islands. 
That party stripped the monarchy of authority of their own kingdom previously and when Queen Lili`uokalani came to the throne she wanted to restore that power as well as employ taxes on these rich white guys who had their sugar/pineapple plantations on Hawaiian land, made all their profits, and paid no taxes on it to the Kingdom. 

Grand-daddy Dole didn’t like that so he led a coup with against the monarchy (130 years ago this year), with the help of US Marines and Navy and put the Queen under house arrest until she agreed to their terms. Leading to as mentioned above, Republic of Hawaii and “annexation”. Then President Groover was against these actions but didn’t want to do anything by force, the next president, McKinley, was for it being annexed. In 1896 the Hawaiian language was banned in school instruction, which led to it almost going extinct until the Hawaiian renaissance in the 1970s and a modern one going on currently. 

Basically America says it’s anti-imperialism, unless we do it.

This has been recognized by both the US and the UN as an illegal overthrow/occupation, fraudulent annexation of a sovereign nation and…. That’s about all it’s done. 

The Hawaiian Kingdom was also the first island nation to be a part of treaties system that would basically be the predecessor of the UN, unfortunately that failed them. They also had electricity in the Queen’s Palace prior to the White House. I see some “down with the monarchy” stuff but I think that comes from more of a European imperial monarchy perspective. The Hawaiian were kinda just chillin once the islands were united as a single kingdom. I definitely believe they would have switch to a constitutional monarchy on their own. They have a solid history of royalty that actually cares about its people.

Also &lt;em&gt;Hawaiian, Lili&lt;code&gt;uokalani, Hawai&lt;/code&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; but still points for putting any `okina at all! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That Hawaiian legislature was known as the Committee of Safety, made up entirely of all rich white businessmen/ministers/lawyers/foreign nationals, ran by Mr Dole Pineapple, himself. The “Hawaiian Subjects” in the group just meant they were rich white dudes born on the islands. 
That party stripped the monarchy of authority of their own kingdom previously and when Queen Lili`uokalani came to the throne she wanted to restore that power as well as employ taxes on these rich white guys who had their sugar/pineapple plantations on Hawaiian land, made all their profits, and paid no taxes on it to the Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grand-daddy Dole didn’t like that so he led a coup with against the monarchy (130 years ago this year), with the help of US Marines and Navy and put the Queen under house arrest until she agreed to their terms. Leading to as mentioned above, Republic of Hawaii and “annexation”. Then President Groover was against these actions but didn’t want to do anything by force, the next president, McKinley, was for it being annexed. In 1896 the Hawaiian language was banned in school instruction, which led to it almost going extinct until the Hawaiian renaissance in the 1970s and a modern one going on currently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically America says it’s anti-imperialism, unless we do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been recognized by both the US and the UN as an illegal overthrow/occupation, fraudulent annexation of a sovereign nation and…. That’s about all it’s done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hawaiian Kingdom was also the first island nation to be a part of treaties system that would basically be the predecessor of the UN, unfortunately that failed them. They also had electricity in the Queen’s Palace prior to the White House. I see some “down with the monarchy” stuff but I think that comes from more of a European imperial monarchy perspective. The Hawaiian were kinda just chillin once the islands were united as a single kingdom. I definitely believe they would have switch to a constitutional monarchy on their own. They have a solid history of royalty that actually cares about its people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not Hawaiian, I have no Hawaiian blood, the Hawaiian people and culture are just near and dear to my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

There are more specialized blade tools you can pick up, but an x-acto will be a good start, just make sure you keep the blade very sharp. 

A swivel knife is a rather specialized tool, but there really isn't a substitute. You use it to cut the design into the surface of the leather when carving a design.

You'll need some leather stamps, there are many different kinds with different purposes. If leather carving isn't something you want to get into right away, there are bordering stamps and pattern stamps, such as basketweave pattern, that you can use to make very nice pieces. There are stamps used more specifically for carving, as well.

A leather mallet or maul, which is how you stamp your stamps into your leather.

A piece of hard stone, such as granite, with a smooth, flat surface, which serves as a working surface when stamping leather. Check out local countertop or other home-masonry type stores. They often have pieces that have broken off and are basically unusable to them that they may part with at a discount, or maybe even for free. 

Pricking irons or diamond chisels are used for creating the holes for stitching a piece.

A leather hole punch or hole punch set. 

Leatherworking needles, also for stitching.

And edge groover will make stitching much more organized. 

Edge bevels can mask a multitude of errors. 

Edge burnishers turn sharp, rough edges of pieces into smooth soft ones, if used properly. 

Pattern kits are a good idea to get started on various projects.

Various leather dyes, antique finishes, and finishing compounds can make a piece really gorgeous. 

If there's a Tandy's leather supply near you, they'll likely have most or all of what I described, and will likely give you some tips on how to use the tools. Many locations also offer classes and/or workshops. You can also order most of these tools online from various sources.

They share the tracks they're vibing with.

1. Mark a line using either wing dividers or groover following the edge of your project at about 1/8” or 3mm in from the edge.

2. Ensure your pricking irons or stitching awl (whatever you use to actually make the hole) is perfectly up and down. If you slant it you could break out the side of the leather or at very least have it look really good on the top and horrible on the bottom.

3. Overlap your holes by using one or two of the previous holes already made. This will take longer, but ensures perfect spacing from hole to hole. If it is even a little off it is very noticeable and sticks out like a soar thumb.

4. When tightening the stitch for the current hole always pull in the same direction. For example you could pull your hands straight out, up, down, back, or forward. Pick the one you like the best.

If this hole you pulled up, then the next is down, and so on will make the thread sit weird in the hole and will make your stitches wavy (up and down the line).

Mainly because I did my research and have been doing it this specific way and it has been quite successful for me as well as many other artists.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are just starting off, you should release a new single every 4-6 weeks. The reasons why are simple: if you upload your release at least 4 weeks before release, you can also pitch to Spotify Editorials. Also, you can be on release radar for 4 week on each new release which means you will get 4 weeks of plays. Also 4 weeks is a great time to promote your music. I use sites like Groover and Submit hub to pitch my music to curators and I run an Instagram Ads campaign to get new listeners to my song. I run this campaign and am usually on playlists for 4-6 weeks. Then, you release your next single and repeat.

&amp;#x200B;

Every 4th release, you should release your new song as an EP with your last 3 releases. This will refresh/rerelease your first 3 songs with your new song and all 4 will be on release radar which gives you an even bigger bump in organic streams. And of course, keep on promoting your song. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would also add that social media promotion is always good. Utilize Instagram Reels, Tiktok vids, and YouTube shorts. Honestly this can be hit or miss but you never know if one of your videos will go viral. I used to release a reel a day promoting my music but it got way too exhausting so I just stopped and usually post 1-3 videos per release and spend most of my time pitching to playlists and running ads. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once you get to the final song of your album, you will have about 3 or 4 EPs, with about 12-16 songs (or however large your album is), then you just release EVERY SINGLE SONG as an album. Now you are re-releasing every song you ever released with 1 final song, compiled into an album. 

&amp;#x200B;

And so to answer your first question I would have releases prepared. Like if you have 4 songs completely done, you have 4 months of release. Right now I have about 20 songs written and it takes me about 2 weeks to completely record, mix and master my song so I usually work within that time line. I have released 10 songs over the last year, 1 song every 6 weeks. Initially, it wasn't very successful because I was still building a network of curators and learning how to get my promotion strategy right, but eventually it took off. My top song is currently at 40k streams (over 6 months). But I released a song in July and it is already at 26k streams. Eventually your streams will trickle over to long term growth. On my Spotify for Artists dashboard, I am on over 722 Spotify Playlists over the last 28 days. I remember when I was just on 20 for my 1st release.

first of you probably won't touch a saw for a little while. if you have no experience you will start off dragging cords, hoses, tools and all kinds of other shit around.  you'll spend plenty of time pulling slabs and vacuuming slurry.  

eventually you will learn to core drill.  core drilling is cheap and easy, so it is where people learn the basics of cutting with diamond tools.  while core drilling you will eventually get to a hand saw, but mostly piddly shit on the ground, small areas where you can't get a walk behind saw or places where it is feasible to transport one.  eventually you'll get the hang of it and start doing wall openings or pipe cuts

walk behind saw also known as slabsaw or flatsaw  is usually the last part that turns you into a basic 3 tool operator.  Slabsaws excell at laying down vast footages on flat ground.  most people only ever make it to this level of cutting, either because they don't have the mental capacity to learn further tools, physical limitations or they just excel so much at it they become to valuable to do anything else.

wall saws you mount a track to whatever you wish to cut, attach the saw to the track and it follows.  back in the day we had the old heavy dumb sons of bitches that ran off of hydraulics and you hand cranked them along the track.  they have mostly been phased out by newer, lighter, more powerful electric saws, but there are plenty of poor bastards that use them.  these saws are what you use when you need large openings cut perfectly, think a loading dock door.

the wire saw is the creme de la creme.  anything any size you want to cut you can cut.  as long as you have enough wire, pulleys and imagination.  this is the shit you use to cut a fucking dam in half or large bridge piers.

Few artists have lej their mark on a genre as ubiquitously as Mira &amp; Chris Schwarzwalder. Ajer more than a decade of shaping their brand of hypno\]cally-charged house with ethnic undercurrents – both individually and as a duo – Mira &amp; Chris follow up their 2020 summer hit ‘Déia’ with a long-awaited 5-tracker on Kiosk ID. ‘Cleo’ features two originals and three eclec\]c remixes by Argia, Hardt Antoine, and Jonathan Kaspar for catalog number 020.  
  
‘Cleo’ epitomizes the slow-burning aesthe\]c Mira &amp; Chris are known for in their B2B DJ-sets across the world. Contras\]ng darkly ominous chords with playful blips, organic percussion, and radiant synth progressions, ‘Cleo’ opens up airy worlds of mesmeric explora\]on anchored in a sub-heavy groove.  
  
Hardt Antoine’s up-tempo rendi\]on of ‘Cleo’ aroully reinterprets the original’s underlying tension. Cascades of rippling percussion, tearing sirens, thundering sub-hits, and a crackling electronica beat conjure waves of boSled-up energy that constantly threaten escala\]on.  
  
With ‘Jero’, Mira &amp; Chris explore deeper climes. Brightly shimmering chords and a resonant lead synth conjure an infec\]ous, evolving mantra framed by a compact beat. Aroully threading the needle between danceable, transcendental, and uplijing, ‘Jero’ showcases Mira &amp; Chris’s ability to turn subtle tension arcs into sprawling auditory journeys.  
  
Jonathan Kaspar reduces ‘Jero’ to its base-most elements and reimagines the original as a stripped, introspec\]ve groover. Mangled blips, warm pads, and beau\]fully resona\]ng salvos of malfunc\]oning machinery intertwine to create the soundtrack for a sunrise on a distant world.  
  
Argia’s Powerbeats Version infuses ‘Jero’ with harsher soundscapes and industrial undercurrents. Clanging percussion, washed-out vocal effects, and a building break imbue ‘Jero’ with searing edge and peak-\]me quali\]es.  
  
Mira &amp; Chris Schwarzwalder are synonymous with some of the most hypno\]c experiences in electronic music. ‘ Cleo’ delivers two slow-burning groovers and three eclec\]c reimagina\]ons that spearhead these experiences, showcasing Mira &amp; Chris’s ability to weave mesmerizing energy arcs, and conjure unparalleled dance floor moments.
