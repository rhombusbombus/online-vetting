There are 2 types of blogs/blogging styles which are personal blogs and business blogs.

Business blogs are intended to bring value, solve problems, or provide information for those who are in need. These are the blogs that usually get more traffic, money, and are just generally bigger.

Personal blogs are blogs that are usually done in one’s self interest, which kinda trades in the more traffic/having a bigger website for something you want to simply do for fun as a hobby/or for self enjoyment.

The bright side to this is that people usually merge the 2—personal-business blogs—people take a niche that interests them a lot and find out some way it can provide value to people that need help. With that being said…

From what I’ve seen, music blogs typically fall into 2 categories:

&gt; Newscasting/music scene reporting such as:
&gt; pitchfork, popjustice, xxlmag, elevatormag, genius

Or

&gt; Musician help, such as:
&gt; omarimc, smartrapper 


Newscasting/music scene blogs are usually blogs that are fixated on a certain scene in music or that are just focused on reporting news in that scene/genre.

Musician help blogs are pretty self explanatory, they’re usually blogs that provide guidance and assistance to upcoming musicians that need it. They do this by providing reviews, answering questions in their articles, and all other sorts of things.

There can also be a blog that combines both of these types of music blogs. And how these blogs generate traffic is the same to how every other blog generates traffic which is:

&gt; mastering SEO and optimizing it the best you can in your articles and in your website

&gt; through social media (Pinterest in typically the best social media for blogs from what I’ve seen)

&gt;  trying your best to get your websites ranked in googles front pages (by increasing domain authority)

&gt; constantly learning and finding out better ways of expanding your website and increasing its traffic from more experienced people

&gt; consistency lmao (1 post a week, or 2 posts a week, or 1 post a day, or even 2 posts a day, so long as you’re getting out at least 1-3 articles a week Google will slowly recognize you more, and traffic will pick up)

&gt; patience, raising a blog is kind of like raising a child, it takes anywhere from 6 months to 3 years for a blog to start doing things. But also never be afraid to cut off a blog that you feel has no potential.


I also highly advise you to read up and watch videos about people who make blogs and are experienced at it (on YouTube, Reddit, Google, etc.) it really helps you to do better in blogging.

The first step is establishing the objectives of your pr campaign then is all about crafting the proper strategy to get there.

The secret is to understand the publication you are trying to pitch to and find the right angle for your story.

If you are brilliant, you don't hitch your entire career to an institute that is a joke in the community that you're hoping to thrive in. Seriously, I was trying to come up with another example to compare how disreputable the Discovery Institute is but it's tough to come up with something as laughable. Just because they put 'institute' at the end of their name does not mean they are reputable. If you wanted, today, you could launch the Omari\_85 Institute for Particle Physics Research. Really, you *personally* could, by the end of the day, no one would even try to stop you. It's meaningless.

Yes, they claim to be scientists, they do not claim to be biologists let alone evolutionary biologists. If you want to know how the Big Bang is thought to have happened and you ask someone like me, you've made a big mistake. There isn't a general title of 'scientist,' it's all specialties. Maybe the best way to compare it is this: let's say you have an excellent carpenter (in this case a pretty lousy carpenter but it's even more to the point if he was an excellent one). He is a trades man, he knows his stuff inside out and backwards. Do you trust him to wire your house? You shouldn't, because carpentry and electrical are two *very* different expertises even though they are both trades.

Losing Dedmon was pretty big.  They need to play defense -- can they even play defense?   And have at least 2 big hits on young players having a big year.  Collins needs to stay healthy, Huerter looks interesting, Hunter might be a good enough 3&amp;D, and Young needs to really be offensively gifted to overcome his defense deficiency.

2. I can't seriously believe you think paying Jabari Parker 13m for the next two years has ""no downside"". You say you need offensive spark plug off the bench, that's fine. Jabari ain't it. He posted a -1.5 OBPM last year. In fact, he's had a negative OBPM in every year of his career besides one. He can't shoot threes and space the floor, so essentially you picked up an efficient ball hog for the bench. Not to mention the **enormous** liability he is on defense.
3. Omari Spellman might have had issues, but he could shoot and had the potential to be a really solid rotation player. You traded him for a bag of potato chips. Stupid for a rebuilding team.
4. I'm not sure what universe Evan Turner is a defensive stalwart is, but it's not this one. The Portland Trail Blazers absolutely loved ET for his personality but he's just not a very good basketball player anymore. That's why they were so willing to shed him for a quality 3&amp;D player like Bazemore.
5. You essentially turned Taurean Prince, Jaxson Hayes, and Nickeil Alexander-Walker into De'Andre Hunter. That is a **massive** failure when Hayes and NAW now look like some of the best players from this draft and *you could have gotten Hunter at #8 anyways.*

Everyone's still riding high on the Hawks after how promising their last season was, but this offseason was incredibly detrimental to their long term success.

Omari spellman is bad. Really bad. And 50 lbs overweight. 

The Jabari Parker signing is weird but has literally no downside. We needed someone to score on our second unit because when trae comes off literally nobody can get their own shot and one thing Jabari does well is get buckets (dude is really young too if he gels and has a bounce back season wouldn’t be surprised if FO extends him to make him a piece of the core).

Orožje za samoobrambo; 2. Orožje za lov; 3. Orožje za športno streljanje.

Orožnega lista za samoobrambo ne boš dobil, če ne izkažeš utemeljenega razloga o ogroženosti in se ta vrsta okrožnih listin izdaja izjemno redko in je najverjetneje ne boš dobil.

Za orožni list za lovsko orožje moraš bit včlanjen k jagrom, o tem bo najbolje če se pozanimaš pri lokalni lovski družini ampak mislim da je ""proces"" precej dolg in nepraktičen za osebo ki bi samo streljala.

Zatorej ti ostane 3. Opcija, torej orožna listina za športno streljanje. V tem primeru se moraš včlaniti v društvo športnega streljanja (marsikdo to stori iz razloga ""ker rad strelja"") najbolje da pokličeš in se pozanimaš, teh klubov je po Sloveniji kar precej.

Ne glede na vse pa moraš opraviti zdravniški pregled in tečaj ravnanja z orožjem, slednje po na vadi organizirajo podjetja za zasebno varovanje, v MB ga je AKTIVA mela prejšnji mesec. Tečaj in izpit staneta nekje par sto evrov če se ne motim, za zdr. Pregled pa nisem ziher.

Da lahko oseba orožje nabavi mora zadostiti naslednjim kriterijem: 

 dopolnil 18 let,

ni zadržkov javnega reda,

je zanesljiv,

ima upravičen razlog za izdajo orožne listine,

ima opravljen zdravniški pregled,

je opravil preizkus znanja o ravnanju z orožjem.


Ko imaš to vse porihtano zaprosiš za dovoljenje za nabavo ki ga izda UE za 6 mesecev. 

Ko nabaviš orožje ga moraš v osmih dneh priglasiti na UE, ki ti potem izda orožno listino, s katero lahko orožje uporabljaš na streliščih ter nabaviš strelivo za to orožje. 

(glede naslednjega dela nisem povsem zihrer) 
S takšno orožno listino ne pridobiš pravice do nošenja orožja, lahko ga le hraniš doma v zaklenjeni omari za orožje Oz. Sefu ter ga prenašaš do strelišča v zaklenjenem kovčku.

 Za več informacij pa pokliči na UE Oz. V strelski klub.

You paid an asset price to do something.  Then you did not do that something.  It's not a huge loss, but it does categorically put you in a worse spot than before the trade.

&gt;Also Omari wasnt a ""little"" out if shape and he wasnt always ""A big guy""

Spellman weighed 253 at last year's combine, heavier than several guys 3+ inches taller than him.

Nobody asked for that.  Just asked that they didn't screw around with trades that lost value.

I'm not going to even start about the John Collins not being a good fit thing because all you did was compare it to the Sixers and these are drastically different teams.

That was Jeff, but also Collins isn't exactly a plug and play player.  He's a guy with some clear deficiencies, which means you do actually have to be mindful how you put pieces together around him.  I don't agree that the entire concept there is flawed.

&gt;Also the point forward you think we need to trade JC for is Cam Reddish

When you are on duty as a police officer, you aren't you anymore, you're an agent of the state. You aren't Michael Douglas, father of 3 and husband who loves fishing and builds boats in his spare time. You are Officer Douglas, and your actions are bound.

That means Officer Douglas doesn't get to wear flannel like he does on weekends, he has to wear the uniform - the complete uniform. No more, no less. His actions while on duty aren't the actions of himself, they are the actions of the police body of the state. (FYI This is why police are rarely held criminally or personally responsible for any bad decision they may be making, because they are making the decisions as an officer of the law.)

Should Douglas get to wear flannel and talk on the phone with his wife while on shift? No, right now, he is an officer. Does Sha'halal Ilhan Omari get to wear a niqab while on shift? No, right now, she is an officer.

I don't care if it's religious reasoning or not. No one is forcing you to become a police officer, and no one is changing things to accommodate you. I used to be mormon, did I petition coca-cola to make non-caffeinated pop, and cry about religious rights when they refused? No. I just didn't drink coke (around my parents lol) and enjoyed the benefits of being chosen by god (so it's said).

**Jon Stewart** during an interview, told reporters that if Trump wins he would leave the country. When they asked him where he would go, he replied ""I would consider getting in a rocket and going to another planet, because clearly this planet's gone bonkers,"" Jon Stewart is a comedian so it's not clear how serious he was about leaving the country, especially when he ended the statement with a joke. Also, we can see in the aftermath that he did not actually leave the planet.

**Chelsea Handler** Actress and Writer. Claimed she would proceed to spain. ""I did buy a house in another country just in case, so all of these people that threaten to leave the country and then don't, I will leave the country,"" she said on Live with Kelly and Michael. (Weirdly, she called Trump charming in the same interview.)

**Neve Campbell** Actress. Said she would move to Canada. ""His honesty is terrifying,"" she told Huffington Post UK. (Why? Canada is not that bad)

**Barry Diller** Chairman of the IAC. ""If Donald Trump doesn't fall, I'll either move out of the country or join the resistance,"" he told Bloomberg. Interestingly he did not do either.

**Lena Dunham** Actress. Claimed she would go to Vancouver. ""I know a lot of people have been threatening to do this, but I really will,"" she said at the Matrix Awards. She did not.

**Keegan-Michael Key** Comedian from the hit show ""Key and Peele' one of my favorites. I love this guy. Said if Trump were elected he would go to Vancouver- ""It's easy. It's like 10 minutes from Detroit and that's where I'm from,"" he told TMZ. Don't go man, we love you.

**Chloë Sevigny** Actress from 'Portlandia' which I never watch so I'm not sure. Apparently she said ""Nova Scotia"" when responding to the question of 'Where would you move to if Trump was elected'. 

**Al Sharpton** You should know who he is. ""If Donald Trump is the nominee, I'm open to support anyone, while I'm also reserving my ticket out of here if he wins,"" he said at a press conference. 

Here is a more condensed list since we are approaching notable celebrities-

* Eddie Griffin- Africa

* Amber Rose- Anywhere else

* Samuel L. Jackson- South Africa

* Cher- Jupiter (shes so funny)

* George Lopez- Mexico

* Barbra Streisand- Australia or Canada (always indecisive)

* Raven-Symoné- Canada

* Whoopi Goldberg- Anywhere else

* Omari Hardwick- Italy (I'm voting him most original response)

* Miley Cyrus- Anywhere else

* Ruth Bader Ginsburg- New Zealand

* Amy Schumer- Spain

* Katie Hopkins- America (she is a trump fan, how did she get on this list?)

So as you can already guess, the difference here is in personal quality. Some people would rather run from their problems where as others see issues as an opportunity to improve.

Kevin Durant’s decision to leave for the Brooklyn Nets – to partner with close friends Kyrie Irving and DeAndre Jordan – along with Klay Thompson suffering a torn ACL that will keep him out most of next season didn’t necessarily apply brakes to the franchise’s rocket to the sports mountain. It did, however, force radical rerouting.

This is the first summer since 2015 that the Warriors are not considered serious contenders to win a championship. As someone who understands ownership is the first step toward competitive advance, CEO Joe Lacob can’t be pleased with the outlook.

The question, then, becomes whether Lacob understands the success/failure cycles inherent to teams in the NBA. The early indication is that he does.

“Joe loves action, in some respects, but not without thought behind it,” president/general manager Bob Myers told NBC Sports Bay Area on Monday. “He wants action with intentions.”

After a frenetic 17 days between the draft and free agency, here are the changes Myers and his front office team are delivering to Lacob and Warriors fans: One top-50 NBA player (D’Angelo Russell), one second-year big man already facing a career crossroads (Omari Spellman), three free agents light on credentials (Alec Burks, Willie Cauley-Stein, Glenn Robinson III) and three rookies (Jordan Poole, Alen Smailagic, Eric Paschall).

The Warriors likely will open the season with those eight players trying to create unity with holdovers Stephen Curry, Jacob Evans III, Draymond Green, Kevon Looney and Alfonzo McKinnie. The hope is that Thompson will suit up sometime after the February All-Star break.

“Joe was actually very supportive of our direction,” Myers said. “He liked the idea of us going younger. He was a little fearful of being an old team in the next few years. But with Kevin’s departure, it pushed us in this direction.

“From Joe’s vantage point, he embraced the emphasis on youth. Once we went with D’Angelo, the idea with all of us, including Joe, – was not to grab some young guys and see what they can do when combined with Steph and Draymond and Klay. Kevon is young, but on this team, he’ll be considered a vet.

“Joe was good,” Myers continued. “Joe’s super competitive, super driven. But he also does support us in our decisions. He’s involved. He’s excited about what’s coming.”

Lacob also is acutely aware that the NBA is stronger now than it was five years ago, and that the Western Conference is downright treacherous. After five years of treating the Pacific Division with the back of their hand and burying their rivals by New Year’s Day, the Warriors suddenly are looking up at the Clippers and maybe the Lakers.

Which bring us back to the subject of ownership being the biggest competitive advantage. The Lakers may be wandering through a purple haze of desperation, hoping to squeeze a championship out of the last active years of LeBron James’ career, but the Clippers are lining up to compete jab for jab with the Warriors.

“They’ve got great ownership,” Myers conceded. “And it’s not just them, it’s the whole Western Conference.”

Perhaps, but only the Clippers have tools at every level to earn respect throughout the league. Chairman Steve Ballmer is Mark Cuban 2.0, every bit as demonstrative but with an air of restraint that doesn’t extend to his net worth, estimated to be between $41 billion and $51 billion – in either case, at least twice the wealth of any other NBA chairman.

Ballmer is in many ways following the blueprint drawn up by Lacob upon reaching agreement to buy the Warriors on July 15, 2010. Like Lacob, Ballmer was accused of overpaying, at $2 billion, to purchase an underachieving franchise. Unlike Lacob, Ballmer believed in his incumbent coach, Doc Rivers. Like Lacob, Ballmer believes his coach is best restricted to coaching; he took away Rivers’ GM powers, hired a real front office and then, as Lacob did, hired Jerry West, perhaps the best talent evaluator in league’s modern age.

And with the additions of Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, Ballmer and the Clippers now have arranged their own “KD moment,” a seismic makeover that ensures a spotlight of levels unprecedented in franchise history while also making them at least co-favorites to win it all.

“What we’re seeing now and what makes it interesting . . . is the fluidity of the sport,” Myers said. “Everything is moving so fast now. All of a sudden, teams are compiling players that didn’t come up in their system or that they didn’t draft. And those players landed with them through free agency.”

Here comes reality, and it’s coming fast. The Warriors will, at some point, regain their footing, but next season and maybe more is time for fans, with Lacob at the top, to buckle up.",True,False,,,,,0,1563333416,,False,0,{},etzlht6,True,t3_ce7axh,False,,False,t3_ce7axh,/r/warriors/comments/ce7axh/monte_poole_warriors_now_must_embrace_new_nba/etzlht6/,1572237800,27,,True,False,warriors,t5_2rtiv,r/warriors,public,,0.0,,,[],False,False,,[],

&gt; Maimouna “Mumu Fresh” Youssef is a Grammy nominated seasoned singer, emcee, songwriter and poet. She received a Grammy nomination for her contribution on the Roots hit “Don’t Feel Right” in 2007 for best rap song. She has swapped musical licks with such artists as Angelique Kidjo, Brian Wilson’s band, Big Daddy Kane, Nas, Dead Prez, Wilco, Zap Mama, Cody Chestnut, Martin Luther, Jill Scott, Erykah Badu, Mos Def, and Talib Kweli. Maimouna has also rocked the stages of many renowned venues such as Denver Colorado ‘s Red Rocks Amphitheater, New York City’s Radio City Music Hall, Switzerland’s Moniteau Jazz Festival, and The Carter Baron Amphitheater in Washington, DC. Her musical endeavors were a springboard for Youssef to make her big screen debut in Dave Chapelle’s hip hop documentary “Block Party.” Maimouna released her first Solo EP entitled Black Magic Woman March 1, 2011 and is currently working on her inaugural solo full length LP scheduled for release in the summer of 2011.

&gt; A Baltimore native born into a family of exceptional artists, Maimouna began performing traditional African and Native American songs on stage with her family at the age of five. As a youth she joined the Baltimore/Washington based musical theater group called Uprising. Maimouna toured nationally with Uprising as a lead vocalist. In addition, the young Youssef played a leading role in the Broadway musical “Once on this Island”. Some of her other theatrical experiences include the original trio showcase “Three Generationz” that consisted of Maimouna Youssef, her mother, Nataska Hummingbird, and her grandmother, Mountain Eagle Woman (now deceased).  Maimouna still continues to perform with Three Generationz – now comprised of Maimouna, her mother and Navasha Daya of Fertile Ground.

&gt; At the tender age of 16 Maimouna formed the jazz/hip-hop/funk/ band along with her cousin Omari “AzIz” Forman-Bey known as Cirius B. In the spring of 2003 the duo completed the recording of their independent debut album entitled “Subversive Activity”. Baltimore welcomed Cirius B with open arms and quickly became one of the city’s preeminent bands without exception to genre. Also in 2003, Maimouna Youssef won the title of “Baltimore’s Idol” and began appearing frequently on Baltimore’s Fox 45 morning show as well as every major local radio station including 92.3FM’s Big Phat Morning show.  Cirius B’s unique sound found it’s way to Grammy Award winning producer James Poyser and in 2004, Maimouna and Omari relocated to Philadelphia to work with.  Maimouna’s dreams began to materialize when she was introduced to many of her favorite and most respected artists including the legendary hip-hop band The Roots. The Roots recognized Maimouna’s raw talent and was asked to sing lead vocals on their new hit single at the time, “Don’t Feel Right.” Shortly thereafter, Maimouna was packing her bags to join the Roots on their world tour.  It was during this tour that Maimouna earned a name for herself as a world-class vocalist and emcee. Read more on Last.fm.

One more sleeper I'd like to add:

- TJ Warren - I feel like he's a sleeper every year. He's improved his game immensely this past season and added a very nice 3pt game to him and because of that, he finished top 50 (albeit he didn't play nearly half the season due to the Suns' horrible shut down management). He was very quietly traded during the draft from the Suns to the Pacers and nobody seemed to have noticed. Pacers lost both Bojan and Thad Young who played in their SF/PF positions and they have a void there for Warren. I can't see him being worse than top 75 next season, and managers likely won't be looking at him til 100+.

I got some very obscure late round dynasty gambles as well:

- Troy Brown Jr - A stash/late round gamble sleeper - He ended last season with a pretty decent run and the Wizards SF position is open. He's got drafted last season 15th overall and he's still only 19. If you're drafting over 250 players, I'd take a look at him.

- Eric Paschall - Warriors selected him #41 overall this year and all reports are indicating that he's likely to contribute as a PF rookie. He recently signed a multi-year deal, and all years are guaranteed - something that doesn't happen often for a 2nd mid-round pick. Draymond is also reportedly liking Paschall's mentality and game, so all the arrows are pointing in the right direction. Warriors didn't have much depth before FA began and they settled on picking up Omari Spellman as well. Again, if drafting over 250 players, I'd take a look at him as a last pick in a dynasty draft.",True,False,,,,,0,1563145479,,False,0,{},etsh5gz,False,t3_cd89n3,False,,False,t3_cd89n3,/r/fantasybball/comments/cd89n3/sleepers_and_breakouts/etsh5gz/,1572013327,8,,True,False,fantasybball,t5_2s5ct,r/fantasybball,public,,0.0,,,[],False,False,,[],

Another very important thing to point out is that the front office traded for D'Lo to use him as a trade asset.

EDIT:

I got around to creating Anthony Bennett and made him a 68 overall, poor across the board but I made him a average rebounder. I used an accurate 2019 roster update, user controlled all 30 teams and used a created expansion franchise in MyLeauge. After making each of the players mentioned in the above post unprotected for the expansion draft, I placed them all in the starting lineup, drafted below average bench players and simulated a full 82 game season. These are the results.

The team started in the 8th seed playoff race with a 22-25 record through January 20th, before Karl Anthony Towns had a knee injury forcing him out for 3 weeks. They went 2-7 in his absence. At the all star break the team was 25-33, with both Karl Anthony Towns and Ben Simmons being all star starters.

Things didn’t get much better from that point on, with the squad finishing the season 34-48. 13th place in the eastern conference. Here are the season ending stats for the starting 5:

Things got WEIRD in the playoffs. Lakers were defeated by the Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs, and somehow, the New York Knicks defeated the Celtics to win the ECF, only to be swept by the Golden State Warriors..

The Warriors may have upgraded their frontcourt by acquiring the second-year forward/center from the Atlanta Hawks for center Damian Jones and a 2026 second-round pick. That hinges, though, on how successfully Spellman loses weight.

“Very far from where I want to be,” Spellman said. “It’s going to be a tough road to redemption. But I’m definitely looking forward to getting on that road with a new organization and new staff.”

Spellman averaged 5.9 points and 4.2 rebounds after the Hawks selected him at No. 30 in last year’s draft, and the modest numbers did not just reflect adjusting to the NBA. He reportedly weighed as much as 293 pounds last year. Those excess pounds put more pressure on the rest of his body, which partly led to a low-grade high left ankle sprain that sidelined him for 19 games.

He has been listed at 245 pounds, but that number might be inaccurate since he did not play basketball for a four-month stretch.

“I’m definitely learning from the mistakes in year one and learning from the mistakes this summer,” Spellman said. “I’m coming back refocused, revamped and ready to put in some work.”

Should Spellman slim down his 6-foot-9 frame, he will likely help the Warriors’ frontcourt in various ways.

The Warriors partly traded Jones because he can only play at the center spot. The Warriors expect Spellman to play primarily at the power forward position, and occasionally at center. That would give the Warriors more roster flexibility with rotating Willie Cauley-Stein as a starting center and switching Draymond Green, Kevon Looney, rookie Eric Paschall and Spellman between power forward and center. The Warriors could also lean on rookie center Alen Smailagic, but the 18-year-old Serbian will likely spend most of his time with the Warriors’ G-League team in Santa Cruz.

The Warriors became intrigued with Spellman ever since he worked out with them prior to last year’s draft. Still, the Warriors selected guard Jacob Evans with the No. 28 pick to upgrade their wing needs. But the team was also encouraged by Spellman’s floor spacing and outside shooting in Atlanta after shooting 34.4 percent from deep last season.

Another added bonus: Spellman will reunite with Paschall after the tandem won the 2018 NCAA championship together at Villanova.

“It was crazy to be with Eric and playing with him at ‘Nova and seeing how he developed,” Spellman said. “I feel I’m far from a finished product. So the more I can learn and more I can absorb, the more I can grow and get better. That’s what I’m trying to do. Go out there and compete and get better.”",True,False,,,,,0,1562799373,,False,0,{},etguvg0,True,t3_cbns2v,False,,False,t3_cbns2v,/r/warriors/comments/cbns2v/new_warrior_omari_spellman_on_weight_very_far/etguvg0/,1571811137,14,,True,False,warriors,t5_2rtiv,r/warriors,public,,0.0,,,[],False,False,,[],

The reason for this, to me, is that the organization, Schlenk in particular, has been extremely clear with our strategy and executed it almost to perfection. Schlenk said 3 main things: (1) we will use our war chest of draft picks to get the players that fit our system (and we won't be signing 5 rookies), (2) we will be improving our defense and targeting centers, (3) we will likely be active in the second week of FA when most of the big pieces have fallen.

(1) When people say ""off-season"" they think of FA, but the off-season also includes the draft. The Hawks' draft might have been better than anyone else in the NBA, (I'm ignoring the Pelicans because they lucked into the top talent). Trading picks 8 (Hayes), 17 (NAW), 35 (Didi Silva) to NOP, taking on Solomon's horrible contract, and two 2nds (#57 and a future). In the end, we finish with Deandre Hunter, Cam Reddish, Bruno Fernando. That's a hell of a haul if you ask me.

(2) All 3 draft picks have a lot of defensive upside. Bruno is a 5. We traded Omari Spellman for Damian Jones and a 2026 2nd (underrated asset from a high-school eligibility standpoint). And we might not be done from that standpoint. Len, Bruno, Damian is not a bad young C rotation for a rebuilding franchise.

(3) We signed Jabari Parker literally on Day 1 of FA week 2, same day as the Omari trade. We signed him to team friendly contract, which mitigates his injury risk. Why not take a flyer on a guy with his upside? But here it's more about what the Hawks *didn't* do. It would have been easy to go the route of the Suns and throw garbage contracts at players like Frank Kaminsky. Obviously we took on a lot of salary in trades and don't have much cap space left, but in so doing, we're setting ourselves up for '20 &amp; '21 FA. Looking at it from that perspective, restraint can be just as important as activity in FA. 

Overall, I'm extremely excited about our future. Lots of young talent. Smart decisions. Build through the draft, make high upside bets on potential, take on salary for picks and future cap flexibility. Textbook stuff.

* DeWayne Dedmon (+1.2, 1st on team)

* Kent Bazemore (+0.5, 3rd on team)

* Justin Anderson (+0.4, 4th)

* Deyonta Davis (+0.2, T6th)

* Vince Carter (+0.2, T6th)

Here are the guys they've acquired, their DPIPM, and where they would rank on last year's Hawks team by DPIPM:

* Damian Jones (+0.3, T5th)

* Allen Crabbe (+0.2, T6th)

* Jabari Parker (-0.4, 14th)

* Chandler Parsons (-0.6, T14th)

* Evan Turner (-0.6, T14th)

**That's a net difference of -2.7 for Atlanta.** It would not be a stretch to say they'll be the worst perimeter defending team in the NBA next season. By contrast, here's our list in a similar vein, including the Otto trade (excluding Ryan since he was on the team the whole year):

* Luke Kornet (+1.7, T1st)

* Otto Porter Jr. (+0.8, 2nd)

* Thaddeus Young (+0.4, T3rd)

* Tomas Satoransky (-0.1, 8th)

And we sent out:

* Justin Holiday (-0.3, T9th)

* Jabari Parker (-0.4, 11th)

* Bobby Portis (-1.3, 13th)

Omari is green, he's got almost limitless potential. I'm just not sure what % of it we'll ever see from him. Omari came into college pudgy, he had a weird NCAA eligibility issue that made him redshirt his first year. Full season in the weight room doing S&amp;C coupled with better eating and he was a [monster by the NCAA tourney in '18](https://youtu.be/TLfRnu9MTVU). In college he could defend 3-5. Decent rim protector. On offense he could play on the premieter and with his back to the basket. He shot 43% from three and 52% from the field. Good passer. He was the 5 and Paschall was the 4 in our ""small ball/death lineup"", and the two of them rotated in the blocks as needed. He and Eric destroyed the big men for Kansas and Michigan in the Final 4 as they tried to chase them around the perimeter.

Rookies are given mins base on the team coach and office see potential in the player and how he performs. When players are young that timing is critical because when they get older players start to slow down, So they develop the skill set through experience when their young. So calling a young player 3rd option of any position you basically saying they don't have much potential. So all I'm getting from your post is you don't give him a chance.

Getting sent to G league is a not normal thing Omari spellman was sent to the G league not just for development but because his poor conditioning and etc he not keeping in shape he should.  players like  Jamychal green, Khem Birch came from G league because they was undrafted, neither situation Bruno is in. His drafted collage year stats are better than Collin. He played 2 years in Collage, He was big 10's All first team and All defense team,

What happening is you don't believe in his potential so you don't want Hawks to give him decent mins to develop. Mean while Hawks are not in win now, it makes sense to develop players along a similar timeline so they have matching prime, Getting vet center isn't going make Hawks contenders Trae isn't ready yet, but if Hawks do get a vet  center now about time Trae hits his peime that vet center will be old, and then suddenly Hawks would need another.  So what would be the point of doing that when the Hawks could had been trying develop a young center.

&gt; According to testimony by Susan Ginsberg, a staff member of the National Commission on Terrorist attacks upon the United States, in the January 26, 2004, Public Hearing:

Four of the hijackers' passports have survived in whole or in part. Two were recovered from the crash site of United Airlines flight 93 in Pennsylvania. These are the passports of Ziad Jarrah and Saeed al Ghamdi. One belonged to a hijacker on American Airlines flight 11. This is the passport of Satam al Suqami. A passerby picked it up and gave it to a NYPD detective shortly before the World Trade Center towers collapsed. A fourth passport was recovered from luggage that did not make it from a Portland flight to Boston on to the connecting flight which was American Airlines flight 11. This is the passport of Abdul Aziz al Omari.
In addition to these four, some digital copies of the hijackers passports were recovered in post-9/11 operations. Two of the passports that have survived, those of Satam al Suqami and Abdul Aziz al Omari, were clearly doctored. These passports were manipulated in a fraudulent manner in ways that have been associated with al Qaeda.

I remember every major news channel talking about the passports being found back then.

The answer is yes. Easily yes.

The question in my mind is did Morey do a good job? And that is a much tougher question to answer.

Although he doesn't get credit for it, there is no doubt in my mind that Morey designed the entire concept behind the ""opt-in and trade"", a devastatingly powerful flex for a star player to make that allows him to join a team that normally wouldn't be able to take him on without clearing the roster to a nearly skeletal level.

An important thing to remember is that this process allowed us to operate as a team above the cap, maintaining access to our full MLE and bringing in PJ Tucker along with Chris... So his presence should also be weighed in judging the trade.

Obviously this makes it an even more clear win for us... even taking into consideration the fact that signing CP3 to a max-contract was also clearly an unwritten aspect to the trade that has since been lambasted a number of times by ignorant fans and pundits.

What we gave up to attain Chris and PJ is not only worth it, it is a steal.

Superstar trades do not usually bring back an equitable return like the Davis and (arguably at the time) Irving trades did. Trades for Leonard, Cousins, and George were widely regarded as incredibly one-sided (although the last proved not to be). This trade was widely felt to be good for both sides.

In truth, West absolutely torched Morey and raked him over the coals. In a trade in which they had zero leverage beyond not doing it out of spite, the Clippers got a huge amount of assets. Unlisted by OP was first round pick Sam Dekker and an additional first round pick in 2018.

This was a far bigger haul than the Clippers deserved, yet Morey forked it over a day before the deadline due to the unfounded fear that LA might not actually accept less. Which is preposterous. Of course they would have accepted a smaller package based around an up-and coming pg on an incredibly team-friendly contract and the 6MotY runner-up. These were two great players on great contracts that filled holes on their roster. Add Sam Dekker to that, and there is no competent GM in the league that would have preferred nothing to it.

Yet Morey still gave up another first-round pick and 3rd-string center Montrezl Harrell just because he didn't assign proper value to them. He either got starstruck in the moment and opened the coffers or he just wanted to make things so overwhelmingly agreeable for LAC that other teams would be willing to accept a similar deal in the future due to the memory of how well it worked out for the Clippers. Whatever motivated Morey's actions, they were still misguided and cost our team 2 valuable young assets that need not have been lost.

Does anyone think that Harrell might have been a valuable piece in our playoff run this year? I'm inclined to say yes. Even a young guy like Omari Spellman might have been able to get a few rebounds and hit a few threes for us had we not cast away the ability to draft him so frivolously. 

Hopefully if a S&amp;T with Philly is reached for Butler we will not make the same mistake again.

Travis is trying to build his version of the GSW:

- Trae Young = Steph Curry 
- Kevin Huerter = Klay Thompson 
- Cam Reddish = Harrison Barnes/Kd
- DeAndre Hunter = Iggy/Draymond 
- Omari Spellman = Mo Speights/David West
- Bruno Fernando = Draymond Green (both of whom are high energy guys who can pass well and switch on defense)

So using advanced stats is appropriate because the teams are comparable. We know how Kevon Looney fits on a Warriors- esque team. We don't know how Alex Len would.

&gt;You know why Looney's TS% is higher than Len's? Len actually shoot 3s whereas Looney is strictly an interior big,

That's not entirely true. If we factor in distance from basket, Kevon Looney's EFG% is still far superior than Len's.

&gt; 
&gt; _Jean Thiriart junto a un jovencísimo Alexandr Dugin_
&gt; 
&gt; Pocos son los franceses a los que el nombre de Jean Thiriart les evoque un recuerdo. Desde 1960 a 1969, a través de la organización europea transnacional «_Jeune Europe_» y el mensual «_La Nation Européene_» promovió la primera tentativa, inigualable, de creación de un Partido Nacionalista Europeo y Revolucionario y definió claramente en sus escritos lo que forma parte de corpus doctrinal de no pocos movimientos nacionalistas de Europa.
&gt; 
&gt; Nacido en el seno de una gran familia liberal de Lieja que tuvo grandes simpatías por la izquierda, Jean Thiriart militó primero en la _“Jeune Garde Socialiste”_ y a la _“Union Socialiste Anti-Fasciste”_ y durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial en la Fichte Bund (una liga seguidora del movimiento Nacional-Bolchevique del Hamburgo de los años 20) y en _“Amis du Grand Reich Allemand”_, una asociación que reagrupa en la Bélgica romana a antiguos elementos de la extrema-izquierda favorables a la colaboración europea, e incluso a la anexión al Reich.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; Condenado a tres años de prsión después de la «Liberación», Thiriart no resuge políticamente hasta 1960 participando, durante la descolonización del Congo, en la fundación del _“Comité d’action et de Défense des belgiens d’Afrique”_ que devino unas semanas más tarde en el _«Mouvement d’Action Civique»_. En poco tiempo Jean Thiriart convierte este grupo poujadista en una estructura revolucionaria eficaz que –considerando que la toma del poder por la OAS en Francia sería un tremendo trampolín para la revolución europea- aportó un apoyo eficaz y sin fallo al Ejército Secreto.
&gt; 
&gt; Paralelamente, se organizó una reunión en Venecia en Marzo de 1962. Participando Thiriart por el MAC y Bélgica, el _“Movimento Sociale Italiano”_ por Italia,el _“Parti Socialiste de l’Empire”_ por Alemania y el _“Mouvement de l’Union”_ de Oswald Mosley por Gran Bretaña. En una declaración común, estas organizaciones declararon querer fundar _“Un Partido Nacional Europeo, enfocado en la idea de una Unidad Europea, que no acepta una satelización del Oeste por los EEUU y que no se rinde en la reunificación de los territorios del Este de Polonia a Bulgaria pasando por Hungría”_. Pero el Partido Nacional Europeo tiene una corta existencia, los arcaicos y estrechos nacionalismos de Italianos y Alemanes hacen romper pronto sus visiones pro-europeas.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Esto, añadido al fin sin gloria de la OAS hizo reflexionar a Thiriart, que llegó a la conclusión de que la única solución estaba en la creación de un Partido Europeo Revolucionario en un frente común junto a los partidos y países opuestos al orden de Yalta.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Resultado de un trabajo iniciado a finales de 1961, el MAC se transforma en Joven Europa, organización europea que se implanta en Austria, Alemania, España, Francia, Gran Bretaña, Italia, Países Bajos, Portugal y Suiza. El nuevo movimiento está fuertemente estructurado, insiste en el entrenamiento ideológico en verdaderas escuelas de cuadros, intenta fundar una central Sindical embrionaria, el Sindicato Comunitario Europeo. Además Joven Europa pretende fundar las Brigadas Revolucionarias Europeas para empezar una lucha contra el ocupante norteamericano y busca un pulmón exterior. De ahí, los contactos con la China Comunista, Yugoslavia y Rumanía, así como Irak, Egipto y la Resistencia Palestina.
&gt; 
&gt; Si Jean Thiriart es reconocido como un revolucionario con el que contar – se entrevistó con Zou-En-Lai en 1966 y con Nasser en 1968 y tiene vetado el acceso a 5 países europeos- y si la aportación militar de sus militantes en el combate antisionista no es discutido –el primer europeo en caer arma en mano combatiendo el sionismo, Roger Coudroy, era miembro de Joven Europa- sus potenciales aliados se sintieron impedidos por reflejos ideológicos o asuntos diplomáticos que no les permitieron prestar a Joven Europa la asistencia material y financiera deseada. Además, después de la crisis de la descolonización, Europa se benefició de un decenio de prosperidad económica que hizo más dificil la supervivencia de un movimiento revolucionario. La prensa de la organización, primero « Joven Europa » y después « La Nación Europea » tuvo una cierta audiencia y unos colaboradores de alto nivel, entre los cuales se encontraban el escritor Pierre Gripari, el diputado de « Alpes-Maritimes » Francis Palmero, el embajador de Siria en Bruselas Selim El Yafi, el de Irak en París Nather El Omari y Tran Hoai Nam, jefe de la misión del Vietcong en Algiers así como personalidades como el líder negro Stockeley Carnichael, el coordinador del Secretariado Ejecutivo del FLN Cherif Belkacem, el Comandante If Larbi y Djambil Mendimred, ambos líderes del FLN Argelino o el predecesor de Arafat a la cabeza de la OLP, Ahmed Choukeiri aceptaron sin dificultad los ofrecimientos a entrevistas. Y el General Perón, exiliado en Madrid, declarará _«Leo la nación europea con regularidad y comparto completamente sus ideas no sólo en lo referente a Europa sino a todo el mundo»_.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; En 1969, decepcionado por el relativo fracaso de su movimiento y por el tímido apoyo internacional, Thiriart renuncia a su combate militante. A pesar de los esfuerzos de algunos de sus Ejecutivos, Joven Europa no sobrevivirá al abandono de principal Jefe. No obstante hay una reivindicación parecida a principios de los años 70, en los militantes de la Organización _“Lucha del Pueblo”_ en Alemania, Austria, España, Francia, Italia y Suiza, en los años 80 en los equipos de la revista belga “_Voluntad Europea”_ y en la francesa “_El Partisano Europeo”_, así como en la tendencia Tercerista Radical en el seno del movimiento NR francés _“Troisième Voie”_. Jean Thiriart saldrá del exilio político en 1991, para apoyar la creación del Frente Europeo de Liberación al cual vio como sucesor de Joven Europa. Él iba en la delegación del FEL que fue a Moscú a entrevistarse con los líderes de la oposición a Boris Yeltsin. Desafortunadamente Jean Thiriart sufrió un ataque al corazón poco después de volver a Bélgica. Dejó inacabados varios trabajos teóricos, en los que analizaba la evolución del combate anti-americano tras la desaparición de la URSS.

&gt; Inspirado por Maquiavelo y Pareto, Thiriart dijo que era un doctrinario de lo racional y rechazó las comunes clasificaciones de la política, le gustaba citar una frase de Ortega y Gasset “_Ser de izquierdas o derechas es una de las infinitas maneras de las que dispone el hombre para ser imbécil, ambas son, de hecho, formas de hemiplejia moral”._ El Nacionalismo que desarrolló era un acto de voluntad, el deseo común de una minoría de hacer algo. Estaba basado en consideraciones geopolíticas. Solo tienen, para él, _“futuro las naciones de amplitud continental (EEUU, China, URSS), si quieres hacer grande e importante a Europa, tienes que unificarla a través de la constitución de un Partido revolucionario de tipo leninista que inicie inmediatamente la lucha por la liberación contra el ocupante Americano y sus colaboradores, los partidos del Sistema y las tropas coloniales de la OTAN. La Europa del Oeste, liberada y unificada podrá entonces entrar en negociaciones con la ex–URSS para construir el Imperio Europeo de Galway a Vladivostok capaz de resistir a la Nueva Cartago americana y el Bloque Chino y sus millones de habitantes”._
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; Opuesto a los modelos Federales y Confederales, así como a la _«Europa de los 100 banderas»,_ Thiriart que se definió como un _«jacobino de la Gran Europa»_ quiso construir una Nación unitaria concebida en las bases de un Nacionalismo de integración de un extenso Imperio dando a todos sus habitantes la ciudadanía y la herencia legal y espiritual del Imperio Romano.
&gt; 
&gt; En el plano económico Thiriart rechaza _“la economía del provecho”_ (capitalismo) y _“la economía de la utopía”_ (comunismo) para abogar por _“la economía del poder”_ que promueve el desarrollo del máximo potencial nacional. Por supuesto, en su mente la única dimensión viable a esta economía es Europa. Discípulo de Johann Gottlieb Fichte y de Friedrich List, Thiriart es partidario de _“la autarquía de los grandes espacios”,_ así Europa saliendo del FMI y dotada de una moneda única, protegida por sólidas barreras aduaneras y velando Portu autosuficiencia podría escapar a las leyes de la economía global.

This is how I envision our rotation being:

Starting Lineup:

- Dewayne Dedmon

- Evan Turner 
- Kevin Huerter 
- Trae Young 

Bench:

- Bruno Fernando 
- Omari Spellman 
- DeAndre Hunter 
- DeAndre Bembry 
- Cam Reddish 

LP wants Trae to play off ball next season, so it would make sense to start Evan Turner a veteran Point-forward next to him who also can defend.

&gt;“To have another guy who needs the basketball is all right with me because that means he’s pretty damn good when he gets it and allows us to be creative with what we do. I also don’t want to short-circuit us, though, but part of Trae’s growth is to play without the basketball. We want another guy who can play with the ball, but we also want to develop Trae to where he can play without the basketball because, again, how do you progress? It’s about expanding your game at an efficient level.”

And TS wants Cam to play on ball

&gt;Schlenk also sees Reddish filling in on a part-time basis as the team’s primary creator on offense, which is where those who coached him throughout high school feel like his best role is.

Men assaulting men: Brendan Fraser being groped by an old man, claiming it as assault and people saying it was a joke you shouldn’t take it seriously. There was even a report that was written about the incident coming to the conclusion it was a joke. If that was a woman it would not have been a joke. 

Women assaulting men: Katy Perry kissed an American idol contestant on the lips without his consent after he admitted he’d never kissed a girl. She said he could kiss her on the cheek and she turned her head and kissed him on the lips. He later said he was very uncomfortable and not pleased with Perry. 

Can you imagine the pure rage of the feminist community if a man in power, a judge on a show made a young girl come and kiss him. Even writing that sounds “creepy”. But we don’t even need to imagine. Actor Omari Hardwick kissed Beyoncé on the cheek and fans swarmed him saying he was sexist and overpowering her and making her feel uncomfortable even before Beyoncé had commented. But we have a young boy saying he was made uncomfortable and it’s crickets from the feminist community. 

Anyone who denies a double standard need only look to these situations. Almost any sexual harassment situation where the genders are reversed men get it worse. A 45 year old female teacher sleeping with a 15 year old boy is not seen as bad as a 15 year old girl sleeping with a 45 year old man.

Manuela Omari describe el terminado del mismo: “Un extremo superior sellado con cera de abeja dejando un hoyo para soplar, al centro un pequeño orificio y en el inferior para digitar una abertura donde se colocaba el dedo índice”.

She push me back when the dick go too deep

The LEAGUE, not rookies, and on a team that finished with the 5th worst record last year. He garnered enough votes for unanimous first team all rookie, and is likely runner up to Luka Doncic for rookie of the year because Trae had a slow start.

John Collins : Our Power Forward/ Potential Small ball Center. He just finished his second year in the league and he averaged about 20 points a game and about 10 rebounds. Usually All-Star numbers. He and Trae have a special connection on the court that has lead to many highlight real ally-oops. Collins. Without him on the court (due to injury) our team started the season 4-19 (or something around that) after he came back we finished the season 29-53 (about .500, good enough to make playoffs in the Eastern Conference) A great young player that has the best in-game dunks of his class.

Kevin Huerter - Another rookie that make all-rookie 2nd Team. Alias: Red Velvet. A spot up, 3 point shooter and the 3rd piece of our infinity gauntlet. He shoots the three ball exceptionally well and has potential to help run the offense. He finished his rookie year averaging 10 points and 3 assists a game. He showed flashed of greatness, including a 30 point game against the 76ers. 

Omari Spellman - An untalked about rookie that was a fat boi, but then became less fat because he wanted to ball with the rest of em. He probably won't be an all-star, but he looks to be a long dude that can shoot 3s when needed. He is looking for Sister Wives if you are interested. 

Kent Bazemore - Our fearless leader and elder of the team (29 years old, what a grandpa) He is a great guard and leader, rumors say that he was told to tune it down to help the tank. We might see his true colors again this coming season. He bleeds ATL and is adorable, no questioning it. Also runs a cool ATL Hawks podcast. - Edit: RIP

Cam Reddish - Duke boi, unproven, coming in hot. See more later. #Potential

De'Andre Hunter - A national champion at the college level. He is an upcoming rookie and we have high hopes he fixes our defensive holes. Brings championship attitude and we technically can't talk about him yet because of dumb NBA rules.

Lloyd Pierce - Our Coach. He is going into his second year of NBA head coaching and has already been chosen to assist with team USA. Handsomest coach in the league, it isn't even close.

I would happily bring back Thabo.  

Dudley played key minutes in the playoffs for BKN last season so he might be a good pickup.

Kanye’s use of samples and vocals is some of the best that the music industry has ever seen. This is shown on classic albums such as My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and Yeezus. Kanye’s music spreads positivity throughout the world and every album of his is an instant classic. Kanye is the most influential and powerful person in the world, with the might to rule over all of us simple minded creatures. He is the only rapper in the game that is truly woke, sharing his own personal opinions, as crazy as they may be, to the world without the care of being criticized or hated on. But how can you hate this man? You don’t. You fear him. Kanye’s motivation and drive inspires countless people every day to go on and achieve their hopes and dreams. Kanye started from nothing, and now his superstardom and superiority over mankind is frightening. Kanye can end all life as we know it. Kanye can stop war and create peace. Kanye can do anything imaginable with his powers but he lets the good and the bad of life distract us from the fact that Kanye is God himself. Judging everyone. Constantly looking to see if we are worthy of being in his presence. Wondering how us humans are different from a being of his strength and passion to create good. Kanye is from another dimension, and his music is just an outlet that takes us into that dimension. A whole new world is just a song away. Warping the mind, body, and soul into new heights and depths never seen before by the human eye. Once in that new place, there is no going back. Kanye does not want us to find out where he is really from. This alien race of Kanye’s observes humans to create a better world for their people. Kanye is their leader, and was sent to Earth to find other people who are truly woke. Our entire existence is an illusion created by Kanye. Look around you. The people walking the streets, the plants outside, the cars on the road, the buildings in the towns and cities across the globe, were all placed here by Kanye as a distraction. You do not need to fear Kanye anymore. The people who open their eyes will be blessed with an opportunity that can not be described in words. It is a once in a lifetime experience to gain Kanye’s respect. Once you have gained Kanye’s respect, he will show you something that no living creature has ever seen. The true meaning of the universe lies within your grasp.

Oh and this from Baxter Holmes' piece on the Lakers FO doesn't help. Who the hell has two draft war rooms and doesn't consult staffers who have proven to be able to get great talent in the draft? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Another story took place on June 21, 2018, when Lakers staffers gathered at their practice facility for that year's NBA draft. The Lakers had two ""war rooms"" set up inside their training facility: Johnson and Pelinka were in one; front-office executives, scouts and others who had helped evaluate prospects were in another, according to multiple team staffers present.  
&gt;  
&gt;As the Lakers neared their 25th pick in the first round, staff members in the second war room expected -- and, according to one basketball operations staffer present, were excited -- that they would select Villanova power forward Omari Spellman, who was the highest-ranked remaining player on the Lakers' draft board, according to multiple team staffers present. Instead, the Lakers took Wagner, the forward from Michigan. Sources said that inside the second war room, scouts and other staff members watched the pick on television and were shocked.  
&gt;  
&gt;Later, Pelinka told staffers he had heard negatives about Spellman and that he had discussed the issues with Lakers forward Josh Hart, who had played at Villanova before Spellman. Hart, he said, agreed there were concerns. Staffers were taken aback, and some said it represented another instance of a unilateral decision being made by Pelinka or Johnson without the involvement of key figures who would normally be central to the decision. ""For him to covertly go to a player and go behind everybody's else's back, that's the problem,"" one coaching staff member said.",True,False,,,,,0,1561048321,,False,0,{},ernahyv,False,t3_c2wk0x,False,,True,t1_ern39i6,/r/lakers/comments/c2wk0x/daily_lakers_discussion_thread_june_20/ernahyv/,1570352666,1,,True,False,lakers,t5_2qhv6,r/lakers,public,,0.0,,,[],False,False,,[],

Bennett in the G-League this year got 12/5 on 55/45/83 splits. His efficiency was unreal (72% TS, which is MILES above his career mark or even his 2nd best mark) but his volume was low and he rarely started. Compare him to Omari Johnson. Who the fuck is that, you ask? Well he is a guy who averaged 13.5/5 on 42/36/82 splits. Markedly worse splits, but he had far more attempts from 3 than Bennett and, unlike Bennett, was a 30mpg starter. He is a bit below Bennett's level, but they are close. Last year they were closer, with Bennett averaging 14/7 on 61% TS as a starter and Johnson averaging 16/6 on 59% TS in 1 more minute per game. 

Omari Johnson fucking sucks. He played for the Grizzlies last year and he is not a good player. He is a solid starter in the G-League and gets better counting stats than Bennett. Bennett is probably better than Johnson, but not by a ton.

Lets take both these guys and compare them to a real NBA player now - Ivan Rabb. Rabb is a meh player in the NBA. Playable, but not good. In the G-League he was a monster. He averaged 20/8 on 61% TS. He even hit 37% of his threes on 3.4 3a/g . He doesn't shoot 3s in the NBA. He blocked the same number shots in the NBA and G-League this season despite playing 3 times more NBA minutes than G-League minutes. This guy is mediocre on an NBA level but did whatever he wanted in the G-League.

Lets review. Fringe NBA players look like stars in the G-League. Anthony Bennett looks like an average starter in the G-League, while playing as a 6th man. If a fringe NBA player is a star in the G-League, and Anthony Bennett is barely a starter in the G-League, what does that make Bennett on the scale of NBA players?

The extra year on his deal is the reason the Bucks dealt him to us, which is smart on their end. I see this as a win-win for both teams. Bucks clear some longer-term cap for the immediate cap relief (assuming Leuer is waived or dealt again), and the Pistons get an SF (they have 0), and a 1st rounder to go along with it.

&amp;#x200B;

Now not only does this give us 2 1st rounders to use, but it also gives us a bit more freedom with our FA approach. We were probably looking at spreading our exceptions across multiple players at multiple positions, understandably so. However, with the addition of another 1st rounder AND Snell himself, it could potentially narrow our exception targets a bit. Now, I do not except the 30th pick to play for us all that much, hell maybe he'll spend the whole year in the G-league, but we just had Bruce Brown play all season for us and no matter what we do in FA/Draft, our roster isn't going to be vastly improved over last year's team. There's a very legitimate shot at minutes at ANY position on this roster, some starter (SF/SG), and then A LOT of backup minutes at each of the 5 positions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe Snell starts for us, hopefully, he doesn't, I'd like for him to be a solid rotational player for one of the league's most top-heavy, talent-deficient rosters. If he can do that, cool, good enough for me. Then, hopefully, the 1st round pick is either a draft and stash or another high upside wing or PG similar to the profiles they drafted last year. The very worst case scenario for this trade is we traded an expiring deal of a fringe 10th man on a 9.5m/1 yr deal for GRIII on a \~11m AAV for 2 seasons + a 1st round pick that busts or never plays in the NBA. To be honest, I think that's worth the risk.

Catching Up with Omari Nyaega: The Man Who Took a Machete to the Face Defending an Orphanage

And he tells us what he's been up to since he saved a Kenyan orphanage from a vicious attack.

On a fateful night in 2012, Omari Anthony Nyaega, then just 24-years-old, awoke to find intruders breaking into the Kenyan orphanage in which he worked and lived. Nyaega instantly realized something was wrong when he noticed a flashlight shining underneath the crevice of his door.

It wasn’t the first time the Faraja Orphanage–located in Ngong on the outskirts of Nairobi–had been attacked. The children’s home was the target of three previous attempts that same month. But each time, Nyaega had thwarted off the thugs.

This time, however, a gang of eight had managed to break into the very bedroom where Nyaega slept. In an effort to protect the children, Nyaega instinctively threw a hammer at the attackers.

They responded by hacking him in the face with a machete. Near death and mutilated, the next thing he remembers is waking up in the hospital.

Soon after, Nyaega, sporting 12 stitches to his face, returned to Faraja. It was at the orphanage that he first met Ben Hardwick, a 21-year-old Penn State student who was in Kenya on an internship at a nearby organization.

A few days after the attack, Hardwick (or Reddit user [TheLake](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheLake) cheerfully told Nyaega, “I have good news for you: I posted your story on the Internet. On this thing called… Reddit.”

Unbeknownst to Nyaega, he had gone viral. Reddit users were so moved by his story that they raised over $80,000 dollars for the orphanage.

Nyaega was shocked but grateful. He humbly told Hardwick, “When you get the money, make sure it’s for the kids. I don’t want this kind of restitution.”

The orphanage’s faculty used a portion of the funds to build a fence around the property, hoping that it would protect them from would-be attackers.

We recently caught up with Omari Nyaega, now 28, to find out how he and the orphanage have been doing since his story first broke on Reddit.

Nyaega tells us that before they even finished constructing a wall, intruders had tried to break in yet again.

As for the attackers’ motivation? It’s hard to speculate. The break-in could have been an attempted burglary. But since the orphanage houses girls, it might have been an attempted rape. “I don’t want to imagine that it could have gone to that level,” he says.

Luckily, the attackers were never successful again. Nyaega’s story had garnered so much publicity, in fact, that the local police took notice. “They were patrolling the roads to the orphanage more. It was really a good thing,” he says. Their involvement was unexpected, considering the police never bothered to arrest the original attackers.

And to ensure extra security, the children’s home purchased four dogs. “Every time there is a strange movement, they bark. That really made people comfortable.”

Just four months ago, however, the orphanage was forced to move to a new location in Loodarak Kajiado county.”We couldn’t afford paying the rent,” he said.

But faculty members consider the new space an improvement. It’s much larger than their previous home, meaning they can eventually provide housing for more children.

Since the attack, Nyaega graduated from college with a degree in civil and structural engineering. And he started a family of his own; so he moved out of the orphanage. He’s the father of a 1-year-old and 3-year-old boy.

Nyaega no longer works at the orphanage on a daily basis ever since he officially registered his own construction company. But every weekend, he still manages to visit the children at Faraja. During the holiday season, he houses kids in his extra room so that “they have a real family outside of the orphanage.”

And he prefers living 20 miles away from where the original attack took place, so that he’s not reminded of the incident every day.

He explains:

“I can tell you: it’s not done yet. Even my body has adapted. You just wake up at night to see if your kids are okay. It really affected me so badly. I think I became very overprotective (with the kids).”

But according to Nyaega, it was the orphans who suffered most from his attack. Some of them had witnessed their parents being hacked to death prior to living at the orphanage.

“I’ve also been hacked, and they see blood. You could see a kid staring at you. He thinks you are going to die the next minute. You can imagine that type of trauma.”

A psychologist was brought in, but Nyaega says the healing process is ongoing.

When asked about his newfound fame on Reddit, Nyaega laughs. “I need to be honest. I had to lie.”

Nyaega didn’t want to bring attention to the amount of money that his orphanage had acquired. He told people that his scar was a result of an accident, and he didn’t extend the conversation beyond that.

He explains, “The issue of being a celebrity? You don’t celebrate this kind of a situation. It’s not a good situation for you to go out and be a celebrity.”

And in spite of all that he had endured, Nyaega is still very hopeful for the future.

“The magnitude of work that [Reddit] had done, is big. I think some things— I don’t know— happen for a reason? Things have been good. The situation has really looked up.”

I can't think of any articles off the top of my head, but I also recommend looking through the written articles of Ghaith al-Omari. He's a fascinating former Palestinian negotiator, and he writes quite a bit of interesting stuff on the subject, though more focused on immediate affairs.

That's a good starting point. I can recommend more if need be, on a lot of different perspectives.

A lot of people think Indyk blamed Israel, because that's how it was painted in the first few mentions. The more he spoke, the more clear it became that he didn't view it that way, but no one remembers that part.

When asked what the key was to failure in 2017, [Indyk said it was the Palestinians](https://www.npr.org/2017/06/08/532120148/former-u-s-envoy-explains-why-mideast-peace-talks-collapsed-in-2014). The interviewer shifted it immediately to Netanyahu, as interviewers tend to do, but didn't get Indyk to say anything different in the end.

In 2014, he was saying the same. He told [*The Atlantic* that](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/07/indyk-netanyahu-and-abbas-loathe-each-other/373922/) Netanyahu had moved into the zone of a possible agreement, but Abbas ""shut down"". Goldberg claims he got the ""impression"" that it was settlements that did the most harm, but what Indyk is actually quoted saying doesn't shift the blame to that. Others have noted in his other speeches that he always says settlements harm the process, but that [the final step was Palestinian refusal](https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/In-historic-speech-Indyk-opens-up-on-breakdown-of-Israeli-Palestinian-peace-talks-351763). Then he revealed in 2015 that [Israel had offered a settlement freeze](https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Indyk-Israel-offered-Palestinians-portions-of-Area-C-in-West-Bank-and-a-building-freeze-432923), and Palestinians refused, making clear why he explicitly said in 2017 the blame was with Palestinians.",True,False,,,,,0,1560742709,,1560743098,0,{},erdi0xj,False,t3_c166c1,False,,True,t1_erdgqlm,/r/geopolitics/comments/c166c1/question_how_do_you_see_the_next_30_years_of_the/erdi0xj/,1570118153,3,,True,False,geopolitics,t5_2qhnn,r/geopolitics,public,,0.0,,,[],False,False,,[],

&amp;#x200B;

This. Noone seems to be talking about how Rob is running a Draft with TWO WAR ROOMS? Separated off from the scouting department. This is objectively an odd and bad strategy. 

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;Another story took place on June 21, 2018, when Lakers staffers gathered at their practice facility for that year's NBA draft. The Lakers had two ""war rooms"" set up inside their training facility: Johnson and Pelinka were in one; front-office executives, scouts and others who had helped evaluate prospects were in another, according to multiple team staffers present.  
&gt;  
&gt;As the Lakers neared their 25th pick in the first round, staff members in the second war room expected -- and, according to one basketball operations staffer present, were excited -- that they would select Villanova power forward Omari Spellman, who was the highest-ranked remaining player on the Lakers' draft board, according to multiple team staffers present. Instead, the Lakers took Wagner, the forward from Michigan. Sources said that inside the second war room, scouts and other staff members watched the pick on television and were shocked.",True,False,,,,,0,1560282581,,False,0,{},eqsdrzr,False,t3_bzd10g,False,,True,t1_eqs6kll,/r/lakers/comments/bzd10g/daily_lakers_discussion_thread_june_11/eqsdrzr/,1569486847,1,,True,False,lakers,t5_2qhv6,r/lakers,public,,0.0,,,[],False,False,,[],

[],,,rivbernardini,1463185050.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_xwwtg,False,,"The Hawks currently have zero true small forwards on their roster after trading Taurean Prince to the Brooklyn Nets last week. If the Hawks’ draft strategy wasn’t clear before, the trade brought clarity on what the team should do come June 20.

Atlanta currently holds picks Nos. 8, 10, 17, 35, 41 and 44 — by far the best draft capital of any team in the league, and Atlanta is the only team with six picks. It likely will be stated several more times in the coming days, but Hawks general manager Travis Schlenk has repeatedly said the team probably was not going to add five rookies to the team, prior to the Prince deal which netted the No. 17 pick, so there’s no way the team will make six picks.

At least two of the team’s first picks in the draft likely will be wings who primarily can play the small forward position because the current choices on the roster aren’t well-suited to do so on a starter level. When Prince sprained his ankle in December, De’Andre Bembry filled in at the 3, but he’s more of a shooting guard, and the same goes for Allen Crabbe, who was acquired from Brooklyn. Lloyd Pierce has said Kevin Huerter has the versatility to play the 3, but that would require the rookie adding significant weight this offseason.

No one else under contract has the ability to have their primary position be the 3, so the team’s starter at the position heading into next season will have to be acquired through the draft or free agency.

That’s why it makes sense for the Hawks to devote two of their first-round picks to wings. Even if the team trades up, it likely would not require all three of their top-20 picks to do so. A realistic trade to get to No. 3, if the New York Knicks were open to moving down, would likely involve picks Nos. 8, 17, 35 and 41, if New York wanted all of the draft capital now.

The same goes for a potential deal with Cleveland involving the No. 5 pick. Cleveland is the likeliest trade partner for Atlanta in the top five because New Orleans won’t move down from No. 1; it doesn’t make sense to get to No. 2 because Murray State point guard Ja Morant is the pick there and the Hawks have a point guard and the Knicks and Los Angeles Lakers will call New Orleans and dangle picks Nos. 3 and 4 in any deal involving Anthony Davis.

Last year, Phoenix moved up to No. 10 to select Mikal Bridges and traded the No. 16 pick to Philadelphia and a 2021 first-round pick. The year before, Portland acquired the No. 10 pick for Nos. 15 and 20. The Hawks could offer the Cavaliers picks Nos. 8, 17 and 35 for No. 5, and it should be enough.

At No. 5, it should allow Atlanta the opportunity to draft someone it feels is ready to contribute immediately out of Texas Tech’s Jarrett Culver, Virginia’s De’Andre Hunter or Duke’s Cam Reddish. Keeping No. 10 also allows the Hawks to grab another wing and possibly one of the aforementioned if he falls to them, or if not, North Carolina’s Nassir Little could be an option. The Athletic’s draft expert Sam Vecenie said adding Hunter and Reddish would be the team’s best-case scenario if it remained at Nos. 8 and 10.

“I think if they could end up with Hunter and Cam Reddish, it would be an interesting mix of swing-to-the-fences with Cam and getting a guy who is going to contribute in Hunter,” Vecenie said. “I think De’Andre Hunter is going to step in the NBA and be a Hawks-like DeMarre Carroll. He’ll be a guy who averages like 11 points, shoots 36 percent from 3 and is super switchable and very positive on defense. That’s a super valuable player. Cam is a question mark, but the Hawks have such a strong developmental basis and a core that would make it an ideal landing spot for Cam. I think Atlanta is the place where he’s most likely to succeed.”

With the Hawks interested in bringing back Dewayne Dedmon once free agency begins and possibly signing him to a short-term, lucrative deal, according to The Athletic’s Shams Charania, it makes sense for the Hawks to use their first-round picks on wings because that’s where the team is most deficient right now — and where the best value is.

In the past five drafts, there have been eight centers taken in the first 10 picks: Karl-Anthony Towns (selected No. 1), Deandre Ayton (1) Joel Embiid (3), Mo Bamba (6), Willie Cauley-Stein (6), Jakob Poeltl (9), Thon Maker (10) and Zach Collins (10). As recent history shows, there hasn’t been much value in taking a center in the top 10 outside of the first three picks.

The Hawks brought in Texas center Jaxson Hayes this past week for a private workout, and numerous mock drafts have had the team taking him at No. 10. But there just might be better value for Atlanta to trade up to grab the wing it wants in the top five and select another with its second first-round pick at either Nos. 10 or 17. If a center is what the team wants to draft, either trading up late in the first round or waiting until the second round to grab one might be the smarter play.

The team has interest in Maryland’s Bruno Fernando, who has polarizing stock as some scouts see him as a lottery pick while others view him as someone who shouldn’t be picked in the first round. Arkansas’ Daniel Gafford also could be a choice for the Hawks early in the second round if he’s still on the board.

What having six picks in this draft does for the Hawks is offer the team almost unlimited flexibility, and that’s a good thing for fans because Schlenk has nailed the draft since he was hired. He drafted John Collins and Huerter at No. 19, and both are steals at their draft slot, acquired Trae Young and the No. 10 pick last year, which potentially could help the Hawks vault into the top five this year, and Omari Spellman can still be a good rotational player if he takes his conditioning and diet serious this offseason.

The Prince trade was just the start of what should be an interesting lead up to draft night because the Hawks aren’t done with moves just yet, but it’s now clear that wings need to be the No. 1 priority for the team",True,False,,,,,0,1560197851,,False,0,{},eqpbbwt,True,t3_bz2q6z,False,,True,t3_bz2q6z,/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/bz2q6z/hawks_article_from_the_athletic/eqpbbwt/,1569389204,1,,True,False,AtlantaHawks,t5_2sgwl,r/AtlantaHawks,public,,0.0,,,[],False,False,,[],

Instead, the Lakers took Wagner, the forward from Michigan. Sources said that inside the second war room, scouts and other staff members watched the pick on television and were shocked.

Hart, he said, agreed there were concerns. Staffers were taken aback, and some said it represented another instance of a unilateral decision being made by Pelinka or Johnson without the involvement of key figures who would normally be central to the decision.

Look at the 4 conference finals teams, their crunch time big man is a 2 way player.

 * Raptors - Gasol (3s, playmaking)
 * Warriors - Draymond (3s, playmaking, ballhandling)

The league is moving towards players with diverse skillsets with an emphasis on shooting and defense. Capela only brings defense and he wasn't even an all-defensive selection. His one-dimensional offense was completely exposed by the Warriors, he couldn't even finish lobs anymore. The Rockets are loaded with shooters too so I don't want to hear about how Trae and Huerter would give him spacing.

Okay and?? Normal banter here.

&gt;Quit making this about thinking these guys are babies because that's what you're treating them like,"" Johnson said then. ""They're professionals. All of them. And this is how this league works. They know it, I know it -- that's how it goes.""

Sorry Magic.. But no.. No they didnt know that. Although he doesnt have to tell them a damn thing, I honestly felt like the whole AD trade thing blindsided the kids. If anything Magic, you should have been aware that these are young kids who never been in the trade swirl before. Magic should have gave them a briefing before hand. Atleast that. Lack of awareness here from Magic if im being honest.

&gt;Johnson, sitting beside Pelinka, added that they were evaluating everybody in the organization. ""We're going to see if we have the best people,"" he said, ""and hopefully we do in house, and if not, we just have to get the right people.""

""Anyone can be replaced"" 

&gt;The mistake, sources said, involved arranging a car service to the team's facility for a draft prospect.

Need more details on this. Dealing with draft prospects or hell, i would even say college recruits is grueling becase you want everything to be perfect. You want to make that good impression. However, we dont know the details of the incident so I will reserve my opinion. What I will say, we all make mistakes &amp; sometimes It's hard to deal with them. I remember i made a MAJOR mistake that cost the place around a couple hundred dollars. I got anxiety from that really bad but eventually I recovered from that &amp; went on about it. My boss at the time was pretty upset, but luckily we could get the money back (partially). I took that lesson, learned from it &amp; went on to be pretty high up. 

&gt;One ex-staffer noted that when Johnson was present, there was often a question of who employees would face that day: Would they see Magic? Or would it be Earvin?

I've had a boss like this before. I can totally understand how this feels.

&gt;A Lakers spokesperson said Johnson wasn't reprimanded for unprofessional workplace behavior and that no official complaints were filed. The NBA also has not received complaints about Johnson through its confidential hotline or through any other means, a league spokesperson said, nor has the league investigated the Lakers in the past two seasons for issues related to its workplace environment.

OH.. Now im interested.. Have so many theories coming to me now. Very interesting piece right here. 

&gt;""Never disrespected nobody, never did anything bad,"" Johnson said. ""Now, am I tough? Hell yeah, I am. You work for me, I'm demanding. That's who I am. But at the same time, I'm fair.""

Interesting... Here we see the ""duality"" thing come into play. 

&gt;As the Lakers neared their 25th pick in the first round, staff members in the second war room expected -- and, according to one basketball operations staffer present, were excited -- that they would select Villanova power forward Omari Spellman, who was the highest-ranked remaining player on the Lakers' draft board, according to multiple team staffers present. Instead, the Lakers took Wagner, the forward from Michigan. Sources said that inside the second war room, scouts and other staff members watched the pick on television and were shocked.

This is something that I don't like. I understand they went to Hart &amp; asked his opinion, however, let the rest of the staff know that you're gonna DEBO like that or atleast ask thier opinion. I myself, used to be guilty of this, then I learned the correct way of going about it.

&gt;Pelinka has also been known to sit in on pregame and halftime coaches' meetings

Yeahhhh. Weird. Also, what does he gain from that besides insider insight? I understand being involved, but some things you need to just step back. No need for him to be in the various coaches meetings. I can see maybe 1 every once in a while tho. 

&gt;At least once, Walton addressed the issue with Pelinka, telling him that his presence was, at the very least, uncomfortable, coaching staff members said. 

And he continued to do so after this or what? What was the end result ?

&gt;We all know in sports when you're winning, great things are said. When you're losing, the naysayers and the negativity comes out. That's just the nature of this business.

AND TRUER WORDS HAVE NEVER BEEN SPOKEN! Ask those who work in any organised sports program.

&gt;The Pacers filed tampering charges against the Lakers in August 2017, and the league found that Pelinka had been communicating with George's agent. The NBA fined the Lakers $500,000, the largest tampering fine in league history.

The sad part about this.. Pelinka KNOWS THIS! I've seen it time &amp; time again where coaches or others just blatanly disrespect the rules. If this is indeed true, Pelinka knows he messed up. 

&gt;""It felt and still feels like they removed everyone from their immediate inner circle that would have knowledge of the rules and would have the balls to challenge them 

So what exactly is the Compliance Department for? Every program has a compliance staff set-up and they know the rules in &amp; out. Was there ever a meeting after the first violation or not? Did they just chalk it up as a L? I know that happens sometimes. However I know there would have been a meeting called right after that If it was me. 

&gt;Sources close to Walton said he wanted to make it work until the very end and was willing to stay if management wanted to keep him. But Walton also knew -- and told his staff in response to the question about his future -- that departing the Lakers had to be considered too.

Luke knew the writing was on the wall. I think he was surprised he made it so far down into the year.

Absolutely. We tanked with honor this year. People had us pegged at ~15-20 win range. Not only did we exceed that but were competitive in a large number of our losses. 

**Why did they fall short of/meet/exceed expectations?**

I'd say Trae Young is pretty much the major reason, as nobody expected him to be as good as he was. Collins took a step forward as well. 

**What were the highlights of the season?**

4 OT vs Chicago, Trae Young game winners vs Philly and Milwaukee, Vince Carter 25k points, beating LAL inspite of LeBron's triple double, Trae Young's first triple double. 

**What were the lowlights of the season?**

Probably the blowout losses to the Magic, games where Trae when ice cold from the floor. 

**Which players impressed you?**

Trae Young, John Collins, Kevin Heurter, Vince Carter, Dwyane Dedmon, Alex Lin, Bembry, Justin Anderson, Taureen Prince, Kent Bazemore

**Which players disappointed you?**

Didn't see much from Omari tbh

**What offseason moves do they need to make (draft selections, trades, free agent signings, staff changes etc.)?**

draft cam reddish, trade #10 pick to boston for more picks. ideally sign klay thompson or boogie cousins, but instead i think we just get a solid vet on a short term deal and wait till next summer. 

**Who is set to break out next season?**

Everyone 

**Who is set to regress next season?**

I don't expect Taureen to take the jump we would need him to. 

**What are the main concerns for next season?**

Maintaining financial flexibility and not impeding player development. 

**What expectations are there for next season?**

37 wins and 9/10th place in the east.",True,False,,,,,0,1559063997,,False,0,{},ep630he,False,t3_btz6a7,False,,False,t3_btz6a7,/r/nba/comments/btz6a7/serious_discussion_season_review_atlanta_hawks/ep630he/,1563594846,11,,True,False,nba,t5_2qo4s,r/nba,public,,0.0,,,,False,False,,,

I would say they exceeded expectations. Maybe they won a few more games than expected, but they were very competitive for a 29 win team.

**Why did they fall short of/meet/exceed expectations?**

Trae Young is good. Collins is great too, but from what I've watched (so Hawks fans who have watched more feel free to correct me) a lot of Collins' growth is due to playing with Young. While Young had some nice box numbers, he does a lot on the offense that doesn't always show up on his stat sheet. He's not wasting dribbles, he attacks with purpose, he sees the whole floor, and he doesn't just see the assist pass. 

**What were the highlights of the season?**

Trae Young's second half and the OT buzzer beater win against Milwaukee.

**What were the lowlights of the season?**

Maybe not a lowlight, but it's unfortunate they came out on the losing end of that quadruple OT game against Chicago.

**Which players impressed you?*

Trae Young, John Collins, Dewayne Dedmond, Kevin Huerter, Vince Carter

**Which players disappointed you?**

Taurean Prince (solid season but thought he would take a bigger step), Omari Spellman

**What offseason moves do they need to make (draft selections, trades, free agent signings, staff changes etc.)?**

I would draft safe at 8. So someone like Hunter, Culver, or White if either are available at 8. They have a solid core already, so I really think they should get a little risky with that 10th pick. I would use it on Bol Bol,  Cam Reddish (is he still risky at pick 10?), Nassir Little, or Rui Hatchmura. 

**Who is set to break out next season?**

Trae, Collins, and Hueter will continue to grow. I'm hopeful Prince will have a better bit as third/fourth wheel and have a great year.

**Who is set to regress next season?**

I don't see any major regression on this team.

**What are the main concerns for next season?**

Perimeter defense needs to improve. They need more interior defense aside from Dedmond. As creative and good as Trae is on offense, Collins/Huerter/Prince need to be able to create more themselves so the offense isn't repetitive and reliant only on Young.

**What expectations are there for next season?**

Really too early to say. If they can sign someone like Vucevic, there's no reason they can't compete for the playoffs. If their roster remains the same, they can still compete for a final playoff spot, but I see them topping out at 35 wins.",True,False,,,,,0,1559061297,,False,0,{},ep5v896,False,t3_btz6a7,False,,False,t3_btz6a7,/r/nba/comments/btz6a7/serious_discussion_season_review_atlanta_hawks/ep5v896/,1563591156,17,,True,False,nba,t5_2qo4s,r/nba,public,,0.0,,,,False,False,,,

[],,,HoodedNinj4,1446859879.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_rt09h,False,,"&gt; Another story took place on June 21, 2018, when Lakers staffers gathered at their practice facility for that year's NBA draft. The Lakers had two ""war rooms"" set up inside their training facility: Johnson and Pelinka were in one; front-office executives, scouts and others who had helped evaluate prospects were in another, according to multiple team staffers present.

&gt; As the Lakers neared their 25th pick in the first round, staff members in the second war room expected -- and, according to one basketball operations staffer present, were excited -- that they would select Villanova power forward Omari Spellman, who was the highest-ranked remaining player on the Lakers' draft board, according to multiple team staffers present. Instead, the Lakers took Wagner, the forward from Michigan. Sources said that inside the second war room, scouts and other staff members watched the pick on television and were shocked.

&gt; Later, Pelinka told staffers he had heard negatives about Spellman and that he had discussed the issues with Lakers forward Josh Hart, who had played at Villanova before Spellman. Hart, he said, agreed there were concerns. Staffers were taken aback, and some said it represented another instance of a unilateral decision being made by Pelinka or Johnson without the involvement of key figures who would normally be central to the decision. ""For him to covertly go to a player and go behind everybody's else's back, that's the problem,"" one coaching staff member said.

&gt; It also represented what multiple basketball operations staffers said was one of several instances in which Pelinka was quick to say that others -- such as agents or players -- were at least partly if not wholly responsible for certain decisions, which staffers believe was Pelinka's way of deflecting blame and from taking ownership or responsibility.

**Trades**

***
Hawks Trade-Miles Plumlee and pick 44

Hornets trade-Bismack Biyombo and pick 36

My thoughts-this pick was really a no brainer for me, obviously Biyombo makes 4.5 million more but Plumlee was hurt all of last year and Biyombo will give me a good 3rd center. Moving up 8 spots was the big incentive in this.

***
Hawks trade-Taurean Prince and pick 41

Magic trade-Evan Founier, pick 46, and 2 seconds

Bulls trade-Antonio Blakeney

My thoughts-Also a no brainer. After losing out on the Zion lottery I don't think the Hawks will be competitive in free agency at the start. Obviously picking up another center in Mozgov sucks but hey what can ya do. Losing Prince sucks because he's one of my personal favorite players but honestly aside from his shooting he has little ability and is a liability on defense. Trading him is fine. Getting another first (only 3 spots out of the lottery) is good for me. I like this deal. Take bad salary and get assets. Regarding pick 41 I already had too many picks and shedding this one is more than okay.

***

Hawks trade-Pick 36 and 2 future seconds

Nets trade-Pick 27

My thoughts-I wanted to move up, losing 2 future seconds sucks but hey I'll take this deal 10/10.

***
Okay time for the controversial part of all of this my uh picks

Pick 8-**Sekou Doumbouya**

Well. Fuck. Reddish, Culver, and Hunter are all of the board. Literally all 3 of the wings I wanted. I take Sekou and bet on him to reach his potential. Sekou will just be turning 19 on Christmas so he'll be a good addition to our young core. I like his potential a lot. He's obviously raw but at this point I might as well take a risk.

Pick 9 (via Dallas Mavericks, Luka Doncic trade)-**Nassir Little**

Well speaking of taking risks, I take arguably the riskiest player in the top 10. Obviously Little did not play well at UNC but fuck it I might as well pick up my second wing. Little provides an instant boost of athleticism I just hope he can get a better feel for the game. I love this pick. Taking risks in this class is good, if Nas can hit his ceiling the Hawks get the wing defender that they desperately need.

Pick 17 (Via Brooklyn nets)-**Goga Bitadze**

Man I love acquiring centers in this draft. It was down to him and Jaxson Hayes but Hayes went 16 so my mind was made. I like Goga and his fit next to Collins. I like this pick and found it to be one of the best ones in this class.

Pick 27-(via Brooklyn nets)-**Mattise Thybulle**

I was absolutely ecstatic when he was here when I picked. This is an instantaneous defensive boost. He will be amazing in the back court with Trae. I absolutely love this pick. This is amazing value and I can't believe he was here.

Pick 35-**Myles Powell**

I love Myles Powell. He is an absolute scoring monster after averaging 23 points a game at Seton Hall. I love this pick. He's definitely a sleeper but this is my guy.
***

Review and other faults/things I'm mad about 

We'll acquiring 3 centers kinda sucked. I guess Omari Spellman will play the 4. It's whatever though the trades I got Biyombo and Mozgov in are well worth it.

Sucks my optimal wings at 8 got took before but I can't control that.

Overall I think this is a very boom or bust class. The high ceilings of Little and Sekou make me extremely happy. The floors of Goga and Thybulle balance that out with 2 guys who make an immediate impact. I think I did good with what was available to me.

&gt; running buses into innocent civilians

I don't know which incident you're talking about, so you'll have to specify. That being said, I doubt that was done by an Iranian national or paid by Iran, but I'm willing to be convinced otherwise.

&gt; the taking of the American embassy in 1979

This was a result of the Iranian people overthrowing a brutal dictator who was a US puppet. The US had shown fuck all regards for Iranian sovereignty, so why should a non-puppet Iran respect the US' embassy's sovereignty? 

&gt; Hezbollah, Hamas

Fair. 

&gt; the Riyadh bombing, 

&gt; harboring al-Qaeda operatives even training them

Ehh .. Al-Qaeda is a Sunni Islamic organization. Expecting them to get along with Iran, which is a Shiite Muslim country is like expecting the US to arm and train Al-Qaeda operatives. Except that the US did just tat. They armed, trained and funded Osama bin Laden (founder of Al-Qaeda). Hell, you've had the US arm branches of ISIS because they happened to be fighting against Syria at the time.


&gt; the 1988 U.S. Embassy bombings

Al-Qaeda and Egypt Islamic Jihad.


&gt; the USS Cole bombing

Al-Qaeda.

I'm noticing a trend here - you seem to think that anything done by a Muslim perpetrator is the fault of Iran. ISIS are Salafist Sunnis. Al-Qeada are Sunnis. Both of these organizations want to rid the world of those who are not Sunnis, and that includes Iran. Iran has no interest in sponsoring them. Guess who does though? Saudi Arabia. Guess who the US keeps giving money to? Saudi Arabia.

&gt; Three prominent moderate Saudi Sunni scholars held on multiple charges of “terrorism” will be sentenced to death and executed shortly after Ramadan, two government sources and one of the men’s relatives have told Middle East Eye.
&gt; 
&gt; The most prominent of these is Sheikh Salman al-Odah, an internationally renowned scholar known for his comparatively progressive views in the Islamic world on Sharia and homosexuality.
&gt; 
&gt; Odah was arrested in September 2017 shortly after tweeting a prayer for reconciliation between Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbour Qatar, three months after Riyadh launched a blockade on the emirate.
&gt; 
&gt; The other two slated for execution are Awad al-Qarni, a Sunni preacher, academic and author, and Ali al-Omari, a popular broadcaster. They too were arrested in September 2017.
&gt; 
&gt;     'They will not wait to execute these men once the death sentence has been passed'
&gt; 
&gt;     - Saudi governmental source
&gt; 
&gt; All three had massive followings online. Odah's Arabic Twitter account boasts 13.4 million followers alone, and the hashtag #freesalmanalodah emerged after his arrest. Omari’s TV station “For Youth” also had a huge audience.
&gt; 
&gt; Two Saudi government sources independently confirmed the plan to execute the three men, who are currently awaiting trial at the Criminal Special Court in Riyadh. A hearing was set for 1 May, but was postponed without setting a further date.
&gt; 
&gt; One source told MEE: “They will not wait to execute these men once the death sentence has been passed.”
&gt; 
&gt; A second Saudi government source said the execution of 37 Saudis, mostly Shia activists, on terrorism changes in April was used as a trial balloon to see how strong the international condemnation was. 
&gt; Saudi cleric graphic
&gt; 
&gt; “When they found out there was very little international reaction, particularly at the level of governments and heads of state, they decided to proceed with their plan to execute figures who were prominent,” said the source, who like the first spoke on condition of anonymity.
&gt; 
&gt; The timing of the executions will also be dictated by the current rise in tensions between the United States and Iran.
&gt; 
&gt; “They are encouraged to do it, especially with the tension in the Gulf at the moment. Washington wants to please the Saudis at the moment. The [Saudi] government calculates that this enables them to get away with this,” the first source said.
&gt; 
&gt; A member of one of the scholars’ families told MEE: “The executions, if they go ahead, would be very serious, and could present a dangerous tipping point.”
&gt; 
&gt; Middle East Eye has approached the Saudi authorities for comment.
&gt; Provoking condemnation
&gt; 
&gt; The detention of the three scholars has already provoked the condemnation of the United Nations and the US State Department, as well as rights groups Human Rights Watch (HRW), Reprieve and Amnesty International.
&gt; 
&gt; In September, a year after his arrest, Odah appeared at a closed hearing of the Special Criminal Court, a tribunal set up by the interior ministry to try cases of terrorism. Odah was then accused by the special prosecutor of 37 charges of terrorism.
&gt; 
&gt; These included alleged affiliation to “terrorist organisations”, which the prosecution named as the Muslim Brotherhood and the European Council for Fatwa and Research, two prominent international Islamic organisations.
&gt; 
&gt;     'Odah will be executed not because he is an extremist. It’s because he is a moderate. That is why they consider him a threat'
&gt; 
&gt;     - Jamal Khashoggi
&gt; 
&gt; A second set of charges accused him of exposing “injustices towards prisoners” and of “expressing cynicism and sarcasm about the government’s achievements”.
&gt; 
&gt; The third set of charges alleged an affiliation with the Qatari royal family and cited Odah’s public unwillingness to support the Saudi-led boycott on the peninsula emirate.
&gt; 
&gt; Two days before his own brutal murder at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi told friends in London that these 37 charges revealed everything they needed to know about the rule of law in the kingdom under its de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. 
&gt; 
&gt; “He will crush dissent at all cost. These charges must be publicised,” Khashoggi said at the time. “Odah will be executed not because he is an extremist. It’s because he is a moderate. That is why they consider him a threat.”
&gt; 
&gt; Reacting to Middle East Eye's report, HRW's Middle East director Sarah Leah Whitson said: ""Any further executions of political dissidents is a direct consequence of the Trump administration’s enabling environment, and its repeated, public vice-signalling: no matter what heinous abuse you commit against your people, we’ve got your back.""

&gt; Executed by Saudi Arabia: A student, an academic, a protester, an imam
&gt; 
&gt; Read More »
&gt; 
&gt; In January last year, a UN panel of experts, part of the Human Rights Council, accused Riyadh of ignoring repeated calls to halt violations as it arrested religious figures, writers, journalists and activists “in a worrying pattern of widespread and systematic arbitrary arrests and detention”.
&gt; 
&gt; The panel of experts said: “We are also seeking the government’s clarification about how these measures are compatible with Saudi Arabia’s obligations under international human rights law, as well as with the voluntary pledges and commitments it made when seeking to join the Human Rights Council.
&gt; 
&gt; “Despite being elected as member of the Human Rights Council at the end of 2016, Saudi Arabia has continued its practice of silencing, arbitrarily arresting, detaining and persecuting human rights defenders and critics.”
&gt; 
&gt; The US State Department also cited the trial of Odah and the two other scholars in an annual report on human rights earlier this year.
&gt; 
&gt; ""The public prosecutor brought 37 charges against [Odah], the vast majority of which alleged ties with the Muslim Brotherhood and Qatari government, in addition to his public support for imprisoned dissidents,"" the report said. 
&gt; 
&gt; ""None referred to specific acts of violence or incitement to acts of violence, according to a HRW statement on 12 September.”

Guter Artikel!

Ist allerdings keine Kritik an der Konferenz, sondern lediglich an Alice Schwarzer.

*Edit:*

Und da dieser Thread nun gesperrt ist, füge ich hier nach die relevante Information ein, daß der AStA klar Stellung bezogen hat - und zwar für die Professorin und gegen die Kampagne:

&gt;Der Allgemeine Studierendenausschuss (AStA) der Goethe-Universität distanzierte sich allerdings ausdrücklich und verurteilte die Aktion. „Das Thema Kopftuch scheint uns als ein Vorwand. Wir finden es wichtig, dass zum Thema Islam geforscht wird, das will die Hetzkampagne verhindern. Hier wird ein Versuch unternommen, die Forschung zu Islamverbänden und islamistischen Vereinen zu kompromittieren“, sagte AStA-Sprecherin Fatma Keser WELT.

[And does.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WibQR0tQ0P8) [And does.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXz78NYL4r4) I know that he’s a controversial figure because of his oversized ego, but we are talking about someone who changed an entire genre of music without being able to play a single instrument. All three of these songs are great illustrations of how he took autotune and used it very differently than anyone who came before him. And his album “808s and Heartbreaks” comes very highly recommended to anyone who is going through some shit.  
&amp;nbsp;   
Because I can’t resist, Here is some trivia about the three songs I linked. The first song “Pinocchio Story” was included as the final track on the album I just mentioned on the insistence of Beyonce (it adds a nuance to the Taylor Swift fiasco that most people are unaware of). “Only One” was written about the death of his mother (which, along with a breakup to his then-fiancé Alexis Pfeiffer, inspired a LOT of “808s and Heartbreaks”) The opening line “Hello ‘Mari” is a reference to his middle name “Omari.” His first name, “Kanye” actually means “only one.” The reference to “‘Nori” is his young daughter North (hence “Tell ‘Nori about me” is him imaging his mother living on a side he tells his daughter about her. “Highlights” is Kanye in peak form, being both sentimental and extremely vulgar, in a way that isn’t socially acceptable for a man either way. If you aren’t opposed to him as an artist and aren’t already familiar with the album it comes off of, then I highly recommend listening to the track that precedes it, “Lowlights” which is a monologue about a woman who is having a spiritual crises, but who is sustained through her faith in God (one track bleed she into the other and it’s meant to be a sort of call-and-response). Early in his career, Kanye really struggled with his stage presence (a lot like Kendrick Lamar and every other rapper who had to learn how to perform in front of a large audience). He developed a stage presence by investing in elaborate sets (which you see hints of in the first song I linked). But...when he performed the song on Saturday Night Live, he almost had a meltdown before taking the stage because part of the set he wanted was missing. He’s a perfectionist who learned how to cope with situations that were less than perfect, and by virtue of that, is, IMO, an inspiration to anyone struggling with addiction.",True,False,,,,,0,1556202399,,False,0,{},elqxoo2,False,t3_bf6q31,False,,True,t3_bf6q31,/r/StopSpeeding/comments/bf6q31/after_multiple_relapses_i_focused_on_my_mental/elqxoo2/,1559110891,1,,True,False,StopSpeeding,t5_3cach,r/StopSpeeding,public,,0.0,,,,False,False,,,

Problem is most people don't know how to use these mons, can't really fit them on established teams, or are just shit/inexperienced at team-building so they just end up not being used. Therefore, it's not really the council's fault you see the same like ten mons on the ladder.

That said, it's a shame he got banned. He kinda inspired me to try other mons and really focus on the ones that provide value for the team. I ended up experimenting with Sp.

Omari was a regular OU poster who heavily favored ladder play over tournaments, and constantly expressed his discontent at how people like Finch ran OU. 

Omari's postings usually were like clockwork: someone, probably Finch or a council member, would say X mon is trash and therefore shouldn't be ranked, omari would argue they might not work in tournaments but were usable in the ladder, and would then post about possible sets, ranking, and usage and get thoroughly ignored.

His main thing was adding more diversity to tiers in Smogon, especially OU since its leadership wasn't very keen on letting lower tier mons be listed. And because of that he often butted heads with basically everyone.

I'm biased because I agree with him 100%. I think Finch has kinda forced the OU forums into being a circlejerk for him and anyone who disagrees with him gets either ignored or have their posts deleted for ""adding nothing to the discussion"", or being ""disruptive"" and ""irrelevant"". That has resulted on Finch's opinion being mostly treated like gospel around there to the point I honestly think the council system has become useless imo.

Anyway, he absolutely destroyed Finch with mons described as shitmons by the guy (because let's face it, it's probably a guy) himself in one of those games and Finch's bitterness feeds my soul to this very day.

&gt; Omari Ishmael Grandberry (born November 12, 1984 in Inglewood, California), better known as Omarion, is an American Grammy nominated R&amp;B singer, actor and former lead singer of B2K. He released his debut solo album O in 2005, it went Platinum and debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200. In 2006 his second album, 21, also debuted at #1 and went Gold, selling over 900,000 copies worldwide. In 2007 he collaborated with rapper Bow Wow and they released an album together entitled Face Off. Recently he announced that he had signed to producer Timbaland's Mosley Music Group and Lil Wayne's Young Money label, but he left both of these labels to eventually sign with EMI.

&gt; Born and raised in Inglewood, California, Omarion rose to fame while still a teen as a member of the groundbreaking urban ""boy band"" B2K. His soulful vocals, riveting stage presence, and undeniable charisma helped B2K score a hit with the group's very first single, ""Uh Huh,"" in 2001; achieve gold status with the group's self-titled debut album in 2002; and go RIAA platinum with the group's best-selling sophomore outing, Pandemonium! in 2003.

&gt; Omarion's undeniable media-geniality has led to numerous television guest appearances including ""Punk'd,"" ""The Sharon Osbourne Show,"" ""Regis &amp; Kelly"" and the ""American Music Awards."" In addition to his musical performances, Omarion has acted on the big screen with key roles in ""You Got Served"" and ""Fat Albert."" Omarion stars in ""Somebody Help Me,"" an innovative horror film directed by Chris Stokes and may be seen in the film ""Feel The Noise"" and Tyger (""Menace II Society"") Williams' ""Street Soldier.""

&gt; For season five of America's Best Dance Crew on MTV, Omarion replaced Shane Sparks as a judge.

&gt; Currently he's signed to Rick Ross's label.

At the very least he will be a PLUS floor spacing big man, but my personal expectations for him are way higher than that.

The opportunity hasn't been there and when he does get minutes he tends to look a little lost, but Robert Williams has made garbage time in Celtics games must-watch TV. I'm a Celtics fan so I have watched most of his minutes this year and it's hard not to expect something wildly entertaining to happen when he is on the floor, but he is a project at the moment.

Other than that, Shamet has been an absolute steal for the Clippers and I think eventually the 76ers will regret that move. That backcourt of Shamet and SGA feels like the foundation for whatever comes next for the Clippers.

I hadn't even heard of Hailu Mergia or Ducktails, or Crumb.  My first impression of Hailu Mergia was that this kind of music often falls between the cracks.  It can be on the fringes of what some would call progressive rock, others might call it indie, ambient, jazz or world music.  Not very helpful when you're looking for something in particular.

I came up with several suggestions while I was listening, but dropped a couple off the list for not being lo-fi enough -- I know that's a particular flavor unto itself.  Some of these are medium-fi-ish.  So this may be a complete miss, I'm not sure -- specific tastes can be very... specific.

Luckily I've just written comments about this in debates with ppl. But i'm truly surprised by how much interest normal ppl have in minarets and their differences...

Early Umayyad minarets were square because they served a military role, that's why early mosques in newly conquered territories look like military forts. They actually weren't even thought of as minarets but as watchtowers, sawami3. Minarets were made fashionable by the Abbasids. The typical early 'minarets' by the Umayyads were square with paired windows and often with a tower above the main structure. These are based in Byzantine church belltower architecture.

In the Maghreb, the Umayyads lasted several hundred years longer than in the Mashriq, and North African architecture took its cue from the state architecture of the Umayyad emirate of Cordoba and later the caliphate of Cordoba that lasted until 1031 AD. In the Mashriq territories the Abbasids removed the Umayyads in 750 AD and within a few hundred years there were a succession of different empires, like the Ayyubids, Fatimids, Mamluks - and all of these tried to put their own stamp on imperial architecture. So minarets in the Mashriq become octagonal, circular, triangular, whatever. There's more variety and experimentation.

From Dictionary of Islamic Architecture, p.267:

&gt;Syrian architecture, however,
influenced Spain through the Umayyad dynasty who
sought to recall their homeland and assert their
legitimacy through copying Syrian buildings and
hiring Syrian architects. The most striking example
of this is the city of Madinat al-Zahra near Córdoba
which is meant to recall the desert palaces of the
Umayyads and in particular Rusafa.
Other notable influences were Byzantine
architecture, both through remains of Byzantine
structures in Spain and through the friendship
between the Byzantine emperors and the Umayyad
rulers, born out of a mutual dislike of the Fatimids.

.

&gt;North Africa and Spain share the square tower form
with Syria and are thought to derive from the same
source—Syrian church towers. In time this design
was adapted by Christians in Spain for use as church
bell towers.

So the 3 main reasons for this difference are:

- Continuation of Umayyad rule in the west, and therefore longer lasting imperial style. Chaotic succession in the east with varying imperial styles. Also introduction of central Asian and Turkic motifs in the east that affected Arabia and Yemen through Mamluks and Ottomans.

- Continuation of conquering territory in the west, requiring solid, heavy minarets. Most of the east was not under threat and so less solid, thinner minarets began to be built

- Generally better preservation in the west. The oldest extant minaret is in Qairouan in Tunisia for example. In the east the majority of the earliest mosques were totally destroyed or rebuilt, such as the [Quba mosque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quba_Mosque) built by Mohammad himself supposedly, mosque of Amr in Egypt, etc. The crusades was a destructive period as well.

This style is mostly believed by architecture historians to be of Byzantine origin. Dictionary of Islamic Architecture, p.188:

&gt;The traditional Syrian minaret consists of a square
plan tower built of stone. The form is thought to
derive from the traditional Syrian church tower of
the Byzantine period.

It's also the opinion of the famous architectural historian Keppel Creswell as well. For example, excerpt from: 'The Mosque of Al-Hakim' by Jonathan Bloom:

&gt;Another group of monuments contained multiple structures for the call to prayer. They are all
 from the early Islamic period in Egypt, Syria,
 Palestine, and the Hijaz; specifically, the mosque
 of 'Amr in Fustat, the Umayyad Mosque of Da-
 mascus, the Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem, the
 Mosque of the Prophet in Medina, and the Masjid
 al-Haram in Mecca. An understanding of these
 mosques is essential to any explanation of the
 minarets of the Hakim mosque.

&gt;According to al-Maqrizi, the Umayyad ca-
 liph Mu'awiya ordered Maslama, the governor of
 Egypt, to build sawami' for the adhan on the
 mosque of 'Amr in Fustat; four sawami' were
 placed at the four corners, or rukn, of the
 mosque.40 **Creswell argues that these sawami'
 were likely to have been four square towers, since
 the order came from Damascus.41**


So that style of paired windows in a square base is originally Byzantine, then picked up by the Umayyads and propagated, just like their favoured semicircular and horseshoe arches. [Here](https://a4.pbase.com/o6/93/329493/1/79276449.c0iizbDD.SyriaMay07922.jpg) it is in the Umayyad mosque in Damascus. [Here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.archnet.org/system/media_contents/contents/126337/original/IAA138401.jpg?1500405463) they are in the Umayyad mosque in Aleppo with bonus scalloped arches as well. Notice the small crown atop the square base. They often also had the classic Umayyad crenellation. [Here](https://res.cloudinary.com/fleetnation/image/private/c_fit,w_1120/g_south,l_text:style_gothic2:%C2%A9%20Artur%20Bogacki,o_20,y_10/g_center,l_watermark4,o_25,y_50/v1415367874/eziymmrfsnlyxncl53d4.jpg) it is in Cordoba. [Here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Mosquee_al-akim_le_caire_1.jpg) it is in Al-Hakim mosque in Cairo. You can find it throughout Arabia and the Levant, and it's originally pre-Islamic, probably Assyrian or Pharaonic. Another square example is Syria's third oldest mosque in Idlib, [Ma'arat Misrin](https://syriadirect.org/uploads/2016/06/thumbs/20160602181540_500_500_t_t_f.jpg) which is believed to have been built before 650 but no one knows for sure. I think it's been totally destroyed in the war though... You can see the same square style in the [Al Aqsa mosque](http://www.atlastours.net/holyland/al_aqsa_mosque_minaret.jpg) (though these were built later to emulate the umayyad style), the [Ramla mosque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Mosque,_Ramla) in Palestine 720 AD, the [Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Hebron_Cave_of_the_Patriarchs.jpg/1920px-Hebron_Cave_of_the_Patriarchs.jpg) (637 AD but likely rebuilt or amended later), the [Great mosque of Aleppo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Aleppo-Great-mosque-Alp.jpg/1920px-Aleppo-Great-mosque-Alp.jpg) (715), the ruins of  [Al-Omari mosque](http://docplayer.net/docs-images/57/40173957/images/12-0.jpg) in Syria in 721. The [Great Mosque of Harran](https://previews.123rf.com/images/shanin/shanin1211/shanin121100264/16507159-ruins-of-minaret-of-great-mosque-in-harran-turkey-.jpg) (now in southern Turkey) built by the Umayyads between 744-750.

Interestingly, the Fatimids, Almoravids, and Almohads preferred not to build minarets at all. (Dictionary of Islamic Architecture, p.188).

It's the oldest one where we know for sure when it was built, but it isn't necessarily the oldest. There are several older mosques where we know that the whole mosque was rebuilt and redesigned at a later stage. For example, potentially the [first mosque in the world, built by Muhammad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quba_Mosque), as well as the [Mosque of Amr Ibn Al-'As](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque_of_Amr_ibn_al-As) in old Cairo. 

But the ones in Damascus and Aleppo may be older. We just don't know for sure because of conflicting accounts. We do know that the earliest Umayyad minarets were square. One example is Syria's third oldest mosque in Idlib, [Ma'arat Misrin](https://syriadirect.org/uploads/2016/06/thumbs/20160602181540_500_500_t_t_f.jpg) which is believed to have been built before 650 but no one knows for sure. I think it's been totally destroyed in the war though...


But regarding Umayyad minarets, for example, from: 'The Mosque of Al-Hakim' by Jonathan Bloom

&gt;According to al-Maqrizi, the Umayyad ca-
 liph Mu'awiya ordered Maslama, the governor of
 Egypt, to build sawami' for the adhan on the
 mosque of 'Amr in Fustat; four sawami' were
 placed at the four corners, or rukn, of the
 mosque.40 Creswell argues that these sawami'
 were likely to have been four square towers, since
 the order came from Damascus.41

The Umayyads built the minarets in that style, and though some have had to be rebuilt since then, they stuck to that style when they were fixed. Besides that, the minarets show clear Byzantine influences and not any kind of Berber influence. You can see the same square style in the Al Aqsa mosque, the [Ramla mosque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Mosque,_Ramla) in Palestine, the [Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Hebron_Cave_of_the_Patriarchs.jpg/1920px-Hebron_Cave_of_the_Patriarchs.jpg) (637 AD but likely rebuilt or amended later), the [Great mosque of Aleppo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Aleppo-Great-mosque-Alp.jpg/1920px-Aleppo-Great-mosque-Alp.jpg) (715),  [Al-Omari mosque](http://docplayer.net/docs-images/57/40173957/images/12-0.jpg) in Syria in 721. In the Mashriq the square minaret style went out of fashion very quickly, but in the Maghreb and Andalusia it became the single imperial style. Perhaps because they were still conquering territory so these buildings also acted as forts, whereas in the Mashriq they were moving to more slender designs.",True,False,,,,,0,1553946191,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ejq6s8y,False,t3_b5knrl,,,True,t1_ejn5uho,/r/arabs/comments/b5knrl/serious_why_do_some_arabs_get_so_triggered_at_the/ejq6s8y/,1554103476,2,,True,False,arabs,t5_2qt0d,r/arabs,public,,,,,,False,False,,,

Kevs best games were with trae on the bench or actively being coached to defer (Philly, 1/11, trae barely played in the 4th and the pelicans the other night).

But watching Hawks games... it's very easy to realize this young nucleus is something special and will be a huge force once it tops out (cap space, draft picks, players developing). John Collins is the future star everyone in LA wanted Kuzma to be. Trae Young is making the strides that elevate the entire team to a new gear. Huerter is flashy young upside with a great head on his shoulders ([comp to Buddy Hield's first season at 24 years old](http://bkref.com/tiny/0HCkZ))

Dont know what to make of Omari Spellman, but he exists as well.

Looking at what Schlenk has been able to do with mid-1st round (and even 2nd round) picks, the future is bright. 2 top 10 picks given how they already look? 100% they won last year's draft. I wish I was in Atlanta so I could see them now in their flashy new arena before the ticket prices skyrocket

This is the kind of false narrative that I am talking about. UNC is like the 6th best school in the nation in recruiting. Ask someone that went to any other ACC school besides Duke or UNC if the Tar Heels are good at recruiting.

And Villanova also has had one-and-dones. Just last year, Omari Spellman played his one and only year of college ball. Sure, he was suspended by the NCAA for a year, but they have secured a commitment from Bryan Antoine for the Class of 2019, who will almost certainly be a one-and-done. Every school is trying to recruit these guys, but they just are not as successful as Duke and Kentucky year in and year out.

If we want to talk about success, the problem for Duke was that we didn't have enough one-and-done players. After 2010, Duke brought in about 1 one-and-done a year - Kyrie Irving, Austin Rivers, Jabari Parker. Two of those years, Duke lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Starting in 2015, it's been a totally different experience. National Championship, Sweet 16, Second Round (following an ACC Tournament Title and beating UNC 2 out of 3 games), and then an Elite 8 that was inches away from a Final Four last year. Those teams, with the exception of 2016, had multiple one-and-done players.

There have​ been​​ many days when Spellman has been frustrated with work, but Milly is always there to wag her tail and give her human kisses when he has needed them the most.

“She’s definitely been big for me,” Spellman said of his dog. “I live alone. Coming back to a home with her in it makes all of this not as bad because you’re not completely by yourself. If you have a bad game or if you had a rough day at work and you come home, it’s not all quiet.

“Milly gives me a sense of responsibility because I have to make sure she’s fed, she’s walked and all of these things that come with having a dog. It makes me be beside myself in a way because I have to think of something other than whatever it is that’s bothering me at the time.”

Spellman’s rookie season with the Hawks is likely over after spraining his ankle in the wild four-overtime game against the Chicago Bulls last week. Spellman is expected to be re-evaluated at the end of the month, but there only will be a few more games left of the season if he’s cleared. And even then, he would have to work his way back and hope there are zero setbacks with his rehab process in order to play by April 10 against the Indiana Pacers, the final game of the season.

Hawks head coach Lloyd Pierce said, “Selfishly, I don’t know what we would get from a guy coming off of injury in those 10 days.” So, Spellman’s season, essentially, is over. He likely will finish his rookie season averaging fewer than six points per game in 17.5 minutes per game in the 46 contests he played in.

Spellman said he’s hoping he can come back before the end of the season, but he’s not going to do anything that is going to put him in a position to risk another injury. If there’s one main lesson he has learned in his first season in the NBA, it’s to trust the coaching staff and understand the people inside the organization are there for him. It took him too long to realize that if he needed help, it is OK to ask or if he needed guidance with what he should and shouldn’t eat, go to the training staff.

He feels like he didn’t put himself in the best position to succeed this year, and that has resulted in a lot of self-reflection.

“It took me too long to adjust,” Spellman said. “I could have done a lot of things better. I could have taken better care of my body. There’s just too many things to list that could have led to me having a better season.

“Honestly, I feel like I underachieved. That’s how I feel.”

The lowest point came at the end of December when the team assigned Spellman to its G League affiliate, the Erie BayHawks, after being a healthy scratch in back-to-back games after returning from a hip injury that sidelined him for eight games. Spellman wasn’t in shape to be a productive contributor, and he knew it.

“Man, I really dropped the ball,” Spellman told himself after he got the news of his assignment.

He relied on two people primarily during this stretch: his mother, Teresita Jones-Thomas, and Hawks two-way player Alex Poythress, who happened to be assigned to Erie at the same time Spellman was. Poythress was the one who helped motivate him in the gym in Erie while Spellman’s mother was there for emotional support.

And it was through conversations with his mother that he realized a change had to be made immediately. There was no coddling that came from Spellman’s mother.

“That woke me up. I knew it was serious,” Spellman said. “This isn’t a little slip-up, and I needed to figure it out. I think I needed to have a wake-up call, and I think my rookie season was that wake-up call. I’m not there yet. That’s definitely helped me mentally heading into this offseason if I don’t return.”

While it hasn’t been the rookie season he was hoping it was going to be, Spellman doesn’t regret leaving Villanova early. He felt like he was ready to be an NBA player.

How to handle everything that comes with being an NBA player is a different story for Spellman. Time management was an issue for him early in the season. Jeremy Lin jokingly shared on the “Winging It” podcast that he wrote a poem, which is one of Spellman’s loves, about the rookie’s lack of time management skills that caused him to be late to several practices.

Spellman couldn’t control his weight and shot up to 293 pounds because he wasn’t following any sort of nutritional plan. He couldn’t figure out how to balance spending time with his family and friends on top of all of the basketball obligations he had.

The challenge for Spellman hasn’t been showing he’s capable of being a contributor on the court. He has shown that in flashes throughout the season, whether it’s grabbing several offensive rebounds to extend possessions or hitting a 3-pointer from the corner.

The challenge for Spellman this season has been maintaining a focus to not allow the off-court responsibilities to leak into on-court performance.

“You have to admit your failures and admit your mistakes,” Spellman said. “If you can’t do that, then it’s a problem. For me to be able to voice my mistakes is pretty simple for me. I think that’s something that I’ve been doing since I was younger. I would take responsibility for things I feel like I messed up in. This is no different.”

He feels his mistakes the most when he’s sitting on the bench in street clothes watching Trae Young, Kevin Huerter, Jaylen Adams and John Collins, the other young players on the team, contribute.

“It’s tough. It’s definitely tough,” he said.

Pierce doesn’t view Spellman’s season as a negative. In fact, Pierce is satisfied with what he has seen from Spellman so far. Pierce mentioned he liked how Spellman is third on the team, behind Collins and Alex Len, in offensive rebounding percentage. Spellman has been better than average on the team with a 34.4 3-point field goal percentage. His defense, like the other young players on the team, hasn’t been great, but Pierce likes Spellman’s ability to defend in switches.

There are positives Pierce is taking away from Spellman this season, but it’s clear this offseason is going to be vital for the growth of Spellman’s game. The Hawks are planning to start their offseason training program shortly after the end of the regular season for conditioning and retraining purposes to either gain or lose weight. Spellman still needs work in the weight room, but that can’t come until he’s fully healthy.

“We got all of the information we need,” Pierce said. “We didn’t need 82 games. We got the information we need on him. We’re still learning the information we need to grow him physically to play 82 games. A lot of that goes into conditioning, dieting, routine and habits. To get that information is the best thing we can get for him. Now it’s about stability and consistency for him.”

When discussions about the future of this organization take place, there are three names that are consistently mentioned as being the foundational pieces of the team’s path to success: Young, Collins and Huerter. Spellman knows he hasn’t been mentioned in those talks by many around the league and in the media.

He feels like he shouldn’t be in those talks right now with the way he has played. All he cares about now is feeling like he didn’t underachieve. Spellman didn’t want to talk specifics about the list of tasks he needs to complete in order to reach his full potential, but he now knows what needs to be taken care of off the court to make it happen and find himself, too, in the conversation of being a part of the team’s core.

“I just want to give myself the best chance to succeed,” he said. “That’s all I want. That comes with significant changes. I just want to have a sense of accomplishment knowing I did everything I could, and I think that will show itself.”",True,False,,,,,0,1552498950,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eig167d,False,t3_b0f0ui,,,False,t1_eieahpo,/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/b0f0ui/the_athletic_omari_spellman_i_feel_like_i/eig167d/,1555988768,9,,True,False,AtlantaHawks,t5_2sgwl,r/AtlantaHawks,public,,,,,,False,False,,,

El mulá Mohamed Omar, que fue máximo líder de los talibanes de Afganistán, vivió durante años cerca de dos bases de Estados Unidos sin llegar a ser capturado, revela un nuevo libro que difundió el domingo 10 de marzo del 2019 The Guardian.

El periódico recoge el contenido de 'Searching for an enemy' (Buscando a un enemigo), una biografía del enigmático emir de los talibanes fallecido en 2013 que ha escrito la periodista holandesa Bette Dam después de una investigación de cinco años.En la obra, la escritora revela que Omar vivió a pocos metros de la base FOB Langman, que los estadounidenses construyeron en 2004 en Zabul, y posteriormente cerca de la base FOB Wolverine, en la misma provincia.Aunque se suponía que era el líder absoluto de los talibanes, en realidad en 2001 delegó en sus colaboradores y empezó a llevar una vida de reclusión hasta su muerte en Zabul en 2013, ayudado por Jabbar Omari, exgobernador bajo el régimen talibán, explica la biografía.No obstante, los talibanes, que mantuvieron contacto esporádico con él a través de mensajeros, siguieron considerándole el líder de su movimiento y escribiendo comunicados en su nombre hasta dos años después de su muerte, señala The Guardian.Entre 2001 y 2004, Omar vivió en una pequeña casa en Kalat, capital de la provincia de Zabul, cerca de la base estadounidense Forward Operating Base (FOB) Lagman, mientras que sus mujeres y su descendencia se fueron a Pakistán.Según el libro, las tropas estadounidenses registraron una vez la vivienda pero no descubrieron la habitación secreta donde se escondía Omar, cuya puerta estaba oculta por un armario.El periódico recuerda que EE.UU. creía que el dirigente se ocultaba en Pakistán, como el líder de la organización terrorista Al Qaeda, Osama Bin Laden, y que habría muerto allí.Después de Kalat, Omar se trasladó a una cabaña en una aldea a unos 30 kilómetros al sureste de esa ciudad, en un distrito llamado Shinkai, donde eventualmente los estadounidenses construyeron también una base, FOB Wolverine, explica el rotativo.El emir de los talibanes falleció en ese lugar el 23 de abril de 2013, después de caer enfermo y rehusar atenciones médicas, afirma el libro.The Guardian señala que la revelación de que el mulá llegó a vivir tan cerca de las tropas estadounidenses evidencia un grave fallo de los servicios secretos de ese país, que ofrecieron una recompensa de diez millones de dólares por su cabeza tras los atentados en suelo norteamericano del 11 de septiembre de 2001.

Generally this match I think that VN right now has the advantage overall. His trigger set is very suited for fighting mid to close range and his Gunner skills are very high making it extremely unlikely he would miss any shots at this range with a shotgun. The two things that are potentially changing to me is Tomahawk and Lack of Quick Switch

For me Tomahawk could win the match for Delorin, but with Nonchalance and Escudo it becomes hard to hit VN so I doubt any will get through as Escudo is durable. The only way I see this working is if he has sight of VN and is using Snake Charmer to circumvent Escudo, but this would leave him vulnerable to Viper Handgun as VN would see him too.

VN lacks Quick Switch so I think that he would only have LB Shotgun, but still has a decent chance at hitting within close range due to his very high Gunner stat

I doubt the trashcan lid will do any good beyond the first shot as Delorin must drop it due to weight after the first hit and for reference I'm looking at Suwa's firing speed in anime since I don't know the actual fire rate of shotgun in manga so yeah two shots could easily happen to pin Omari down

Smokescreen will cause Delorin to get baited since his strategy is two points lower so his back will be towards VN to good chance to shoot then.

Overall, I think Delorin's only win condition is Tomahawk and thats the only reason I'm hesistant to give the win to VN, but I think Kogestu Senku wouldn't be a good idea unless VN was decently distracted and getting close with Senku is just asking for death when fighting a skilled shotgun user. It says Delorin will use Senku to cut down Escudo but hes likely to get shot by the time he releases Tomahawk and switches to Kogestu since that would take a bit of time without Quick Switch

&gt; Dam spent more than five years researching the book and interviewed Jabbar Omari, Omar's bodyguard who hid and protected him after the Taliban regime was overthrown.

The article very strongly implies she is relying on the Taliban as her source for this claim.  

Afghan and US intelligence are also claiming the guy lived in Pakistan from 2004 to 2010 and there is significant evidence of this:

&gt; Former CIA director and US military commander in Afghanistan David Petraeus also appeared sceptical, saying the Taliban leader's alleged decision to stay in Afghanistan would have been laden with risk.

&gt; ""We had access, as needed, to anywhere inside Afghanistan, and I would be very surprised if Mullah Omar would have taken the risk that we could come calling some evening,"" said Petraeus according to the Wall Street Journal.

&gt; ""I have piles &amp; piles of evidence which shows he lived &amp; died in Pakistan,"" added Amrullah Saleh, who was head of Afghan intelligence from 2004-2010.

&gt;WASHINGTON—Mullah Mohammad Omar, the founder of the Taliban, lived in hiding near a U.S. base in southern Afghanistan until his death, according to a new research-group report that contradicts long-held theories by U.S. officials about the notorious one-eyed leader.

&gt;The consensus among experts, including at the Central Intelligence Agency, was that Mullah Omar fled to Pakistan after the U.S. ousted the Taliban following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks orchestrated by al Qaeda, which operated in Afghanistan under the Taliban’s protection.

&gt;The new report, reviewed exclusively by The Wall Street Journal, provides a detailed picture of Mullah Omar’s final years spent mostly in seclusion in Afghanistan, not Pakistan. The report contends he lived with his bodyguard, Jabbar Omari, receiving infrequent visits from a messenger who traveled every few months between his location and the Taliban’s decision-making body in Quetta, Pakistan.

&gt;The report is due to be published in the coming days by the Zomia Center, a research group in New York affiliated with New America, a Washington-based nonpartisan think tank. The research relies on interviews with some previously inaccessible sources, including current and former members of the Afghan government, the Afghan intelligence agency, the Taliban and Mullah Omar’s bodyguard, Mr. Omari, who protected him until his death and now lives under house arrest in Kabul.

&gt;The Taliban hid news of Mullah Omar’s death for more than two years, until it was revealed by the Afghan intelligence agency in 2015.

&gt;The suggestion that U.S. intelligence assessments about Mullah Omar may have been in error comes as the U.S. holds talks with the Taliban’s political office to end the war that began with the post-9/11 U.S. invasion. Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban’s top representative in the talks, was among Mullah Omar’s close friends.

&gt;“The report shows that the U.S. got one of the biggest claims about the war wrong, and it also shows how little we understand the Taliban movement,” the report’s author, Bette Dam, said in an interview. Ms. Dam is a Dutch journalist who has spent years reporting from Afghanistan and searching for the Taliban’s elusive leader and has written about her experiences in a book released this month in the Netherlands.

&gt;The CIA declined to comment.

&gt;David Petraeus, a former CIA director and a onetime U.S. military commander in Afghanistan and Iraq, said it seemed unlikely that Mullah Omar remained in Afghanistan, where he could have been more easily targeted.

&gt;“We had access, as needed, to anywhere inside Afghanistan, and I would be very surprised if Mullah Omar would have taken the risk that we could come calling some evening,” Mr. Petraeus said in an interview.

&gt;Mr. Petraeus had noted previously that the U.S. not only believed Mullah Omar was in Pakistan, but also had an idea of his movements between Baluchistan province and the metropolis of Karachi on the south coast, where he was believed to have been treated in a hospital.

&gt;The U.S. has long hunted members of the Taliban and al Qaeda, often blaming Pakistan for sheltering them. Pakistan denies helping insurgent groups, even though top members have been found on its soil.

&gt;U.S. forces located al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden near a military base in Pakistan and killed him in 2011. The U.S. also killed the Taliban’s new leader, Mullah Akhtar Mansour, with a drone strike in Pakistan in 2016.

&gt;Mullah Omar proved elusive to U.S. searchers. Until the announcement of his death, there had been no audio or video recordings for years.

&gt;The Zomia Center report says that Mullah Omar in late 2001 handed over the Taliban’s daily operations to his former defense minister, Mullah Obaidullah, and fled Kandahar to his native Zabul province in the south. He spent several years in the provincial capital, Qalat, hiding in the private home of his driver, a man named Abdul Samad Ustaz, the report says, citing Mr. Omari, his bodyguard, and former Afghan officials.

&gt;U.S. special-operations forces searched the house once, according to Mr. Omari, the report says, but didn’t enter the concealed room where Mullah Omar lived until 2004. The Pentagon declined a request for comment.

&gt;Borhan Osman, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group, which studies conflict, said Mullah Omar was deeply suspicious of Pakistan’s intentions because other senior Taliban figures had been placed under house arrest. Mr. Osman, who has studied the Taliban, said his research also indicated that Mullah Omar had remained in Zabul province.

&gt;“It looks consistent across the various sources,” Mr. Osman said. Mullah Omar, he added, thought Pakistani leaders “would play him or use his presence to divert the direction of the movement.”

&gt;After the U.S. military established a permanent base only a few minutes’ walk from his safe house in Afghanistan, Mullah Omar relocated to a more remote district called Siuray, where his family came from. Mr. Omari, his bodyguard, found him a mud-brick family home and looked after him there until his death in 2013, the Zomia report says.

&gt;The second safe house was only a few miles away from a smaller U.S. base, known as Forward Operating Base Wolverine, according to Mr. Omari in the report. FOB Wolverine was south of Qalat, the provincial capital, and many villages in the area were assessed to be Taliban-controlled, a person who served at the base told the Journal. Several U.S. soldiers were killed there while on patrol.

&gt;The Zomia Center report said that Afghan intelligence officials repeatedly tried to question Mullah Omar’s driver, but that provincial officials stepped in to protect him.

&gt;“They [secret police] went away because I said Abdul Samad Ustaz was innocent,” tribal leader Muhammad Daud Gulzar told Ms. Dam referring to the driver, according to the report. “Later, I heard that Abdul Samad Ustaz protected Mullah Omar. I did not know that.”

&gt;The report describes Mullah Omar as living his last years in isolation in Siuray, in the company only of Mr. Omari and a host family, with whom he rarely interacted. Mullah Omar seldom left the dwelling except for brief periods to take in the sunlight and asked only for henna, a dye for his beard, and naswar, a local tobacco.

&gt;Mr. Omari told Ms. Dam that Mullah Omar grew ill in 2013, refused to see a doctor or travel to hospitals in Pakistan, and died in Zabul. His family came to bury his body, and a small group of Taliban leaders agreed to keep the death a secret while the U.S. military was preparing to fully withdraw as first planned by the Obama administration.

We have Kevin Heurter who may develop into not something just serviceable, but a plus starter in the NBA on both sides of the ball. He’s a 6’7 mountain of a mismatch for some guards. We have Taurean Prince who we can resign for cheap and is already better than some of the guys you’ve pinned as your future. 

We have Deandre bembry and Omari Spellman (our other first round pick from last years stacked draft). Just Incase you’re wondering he shoots 34.5% from three. Only slowed down because he was recently injured. Bembry has Improved steadily in his young career as a guy who can play defense and score. 

Now let’s talk about draft picks. I’m sure You know about that mavs pick which will most likely convey this year but even if it doesn’t will definitely convey next year in a much better draft (fingers crossed). Then we have Cleveland next year top 10 protected. Then after that we have 2021 okc 1stRP. Let’s not forget we don’t owe out our own pick to anyone in the future. 

With Trea young and John Collins and all of Atlanta’s 85 million in cap space to sign 2 potential max contracts and still have room to retool the bench (don’t forget the anti aging man himself VC). Atlanta clearly has the brighter future and it isn’t close. In fact it’s Ludicrous to suggest otherwise.  And when The hawks get their own top 5 pick plus the mavs top 10 pick it will be the cherry on top.

True. What I think happened is Boetsch is a very slow pace fighter like rothwell, and lewis. Naturally Omari didn't need to go for takedowns  when opponents rush in cause it never happened this fight. It makes sense with omari's style (attempting to play the decision) that he would touch and go and not want it to go to the ground. It makes sense if you think about it. Its the only logical thing Omari would do with his mindset and skillset. A fighter that actually thinks I believe is key to winning bets.

 If I was in Omari's shoes I won't move into boetsch and scrap, I would avoid that power. I also realize omari doesn't want to finish on the ground or striking when he's 100% sure his best option is to win a decision. He wrestles then gets off quickly. 

&gt;Smolka taught me the valuable lesson of 'never bet on a recovering alcoholic'. Was crazy slow in their, seems as though he's back on the sauce

Smolka has issues. The alcoholic part isnt the root of the problem. He's just wildly unhinged. He doesn't do things by textbook and he throws caution to the wind which is why he loses so much. If no adversity is in his way then he wins. 

&gt;Kunitskaya v Reneau was frustrating as Reneau could have had the finish if she pressed harder. I'd never bet on Reneau to win on points because she fights for the finish, but goddamn the TKO was there if she wanted it. Value-wise I don't regret that one

I have a conspiracy theory that a lot of fighters go on a mediocre streak then lose one on purpose to then restart the streak. In terms of comparing it to bjj mindset its the most optimal money making strategy/career strategy. Some fighters that are on the way out of the sport will not hunt for the KO or Win and just take way less damage, take the decision loss. Rinse and repeat until retirement. Dodson doesn't fight properly, Reneau, Holm's a lot of fighters now take it as a sparring match. Decision comes then great, but they aren't taking the damage for the win purse cause if they get hurt then they might miss 2 years of fights..

Running down the card:

White v Moret should probably have been a no play

Morono was a good call, probably should have played the KO line given how much we've seen Ottow turtle in the past but ah well

Smolka taught me the valuable lesson of 'never bet on a recovering alcoholic'. Was crazy slow in their, seems as though he's back on the sauce

Greene v Hughes taught me the valuable lesson of 'what a fighter looks like on the scale means nothing'. That said, I personally scored it for Hughes

Dawson was an unknown given his level of opposition so probably should have been a no play (it's for that reason that I went the other way). Was soundly beaten in the second though so not a confident play for the future. Erosa looked okay, weird striking style, wrestling isn't great but Scrappy defensive BJJ

Kunitskaya v Reneau was frustrating as Reneau could have had the finish if she pressed harder. I'd never bet on Reneau to win on points because she fights for the finish, but goddamn the TKO was there if she wanted it. Value-wise I don't regret that one

Martin v Moraes was a win but I should have pressed harder. Anyone that beats LaFlare soundly is legit, Martin was never in real danger, Moraes just got gifted a decision in Brazil and his striking was no match for Martin's

Thought Boetsch's chin was more shot. That was my bad. Omari went from wild haymakers in his last fight to an actual gameplan and that admittedly threw me off

Dober made his name off of lesser fighters and isn't top 15 calibre. Dariush has top 10 skill with no athleticism and a weak chin. Grappling beats low IQ striking

Rothwell should have gotten the decision. Was surprised he didn't engage more in the grappling, but realistically he won that fight on the points

Price is an enigma

Millender had no ground game as you said. Knew it would go either KO by Millender or KO/Sub by Zaleski so happy with the absurd FDNGTD line (I got it at 2.3, insane)

Derrick Lewis is not in JDS's class and made his way there on the back of lesser fighters

Overall not a great card for betting, as demonstrated by the entire three confident plays I had. Zaleski/Millender was the right call for the price, Price/Means DNGTD would have been ideal at 1.5+ and I kind of got lucky that Price pulled it off but if you keep doing it at some point it's no longer a fluke. Dariush should have been a confident play in spite of his awful first round, the better fighter wins more often than not. JDS probably should have been a confident play too, but as a huge Black Beast fan it would have pained me too much (I did end up throwing a lot on Junior ITD at 2.1 as an emotional hedge). Although Martin was a good play I still feel as though the price was off there",True,False,,,,,0,1552192028,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ei6s53q,False,t3_aum4db,,,True,t1_ei6r33f,/r/sportsbook/comments/aum4db/ufc_fight_night_lewis_vs_dos_santos_03092019/ei6s53q/,1555809672,1,,True,False,sportsbook,t5_2s3v4,r/sportsbook,public,,,,,,False,False,,,

So far I notice that if one guy has a deficiency + the other fighter has skills that can exploit it, then it usually pushes it towards that outcome. The fight because of this turns into a scenario where they have more advantage and less disadvantage. 

JDS can move back and not get chased when he gets hit. His opponent never rushes to save cardio. JDS can capitalize. JDS has better striking and movement. Overtime just his movement, and being able to run away after getting hit he has the advantage. Lewis was done in there by the second. He also has the issue Moraes (anthony's opponent) has is that he can't beat top fighters. Moraes in my opinion fights a suboptimal fight on purpose so they never throw him with the lions, he is a gate keeper. 

Millender has terrible ground game. Found out after the fight that his opponent is a black belt under one of the best teachers. He usually never uses it unless he threatens a few subs then gets back on the feet. The ground mismatch is so large that if he got it to the ground he did what he did. 

Ben fights stupid out there. I think he has a distorted view on what is correct. thats his flaw. His hand movements and his footwork are wildly ineffective. He could of fought like he did in the third and won 2/3 rounds easily. Flaw is his perception of superior technique vs effective technique. Would not bet against him in this fight for straigh tml. His opponent to win by decision  or over 1 1/2 was really good. 

Dobers fault is he doesn't really have strength or pressure to really stop beneil. Beneil also has a wicked grip that I missed. Dober not so great with his core strength. On the ground that must be why Beneil is such a good grappler.

Reneau also has wild perception problems.superior technique over effective technique She clearly lost 2 rounds but always thinks she wins when its clear she lost. Close fight but she lost.

Morono has the overall advantage. Otto skill isn't at ufc caliber. Many split wins/loss. 

Smolka is good only if he is much better. He is not good at fundamentals so he focuses on transitions. Not great on bjj defence. Lack of control which extends to his wild drinking outside the cage.


Grant has the better wrestling and wrestling pressure. His opponent has nothing to turn the tide around. 

-------

At the end of the day the big mistakes they have, and they are big mistakes, Smolka being so uncareful and bad fundamentals, Reneau's and Ben's perception. Millenders ground game! Lewis's cardio and footwork. It all leads to flaws that their opponents who are good enough can exploit to win or gain edge.



-------

Omari probably can get a bet. Boetsche doesn't have anything for anyone that can fight shot for shot. Not great footwork. Not wanting to take much damage since he is thinking of retirement. Omari's strength keeps boetsche away. Still not great for ML -200. Omari by decision and over is good. He usually keeps people off him and wins decisions. Also Boetsch is such a finisher it looked like he settled to coasting to a stand up decision.


Maurice vs Greene is a super close one.  no bet

niko is a close one.  no bet. 

Anthony martin is a close one. His opponent seems to be on a scheme to keep himself at mid level fighters. Both times he took down martin he effortlessly nearly gotten chokes or dominated. He sees success there to nearly stop but for a world champion bjj fighter he doesn't go there. He uses his hands and  win or lose he fights someone a bit higher or lower. His career last a lot longer.

------------

Fights to avoid because of the odds or bad choice no order: 

Snell, maurice, Anthony martin, Omari (omari decision is good), Beneil (beneil scorecard no action is good),  

Fights to choose order from best to worst:

Elizeu, Morono, Yana, JDS, Beneil sub, Beneil scorecard no action, Blagoy over 1/2 round, , Omari fight to go over 1 1/2 rounds, Grant, Omari decision, Blagoy decision

Competition: UFC Fight Night 146

Game: Tim Boetsch v Omari Akhmedov

Pick: Fight Goes The Distance - No at 1.5

Reasoning: In true MMA fashion, my retirement lasted all of one week before I decided the game hadn't passed me by just yet

Anyway, Boetsch's last 10 fights have all finished inside the distance. Akhmedov throws power punches with no defence and gasses hard in the second half of the fight. All four of Boetsch's last four wins have been by KO, including two 2nd/3rd round comebacks. Akhmedov has been KO'd in the third twice. Akhmedov does have strong wrestling, but Boetsch wrestled in college so it's unlikely to hit the ground. But if it does, Boetsch has been submitted in 4/6 of his last four losses. And if he doesn't, Boetsch has been KO'd in 3/8 of his last 8 losses. Fight Ends in KO is also tempting at 2, but FDNGTD is the safer pick and after my recent run Lord knows I need that",True,True,,comment score below threshold,,,0,1552136857,,False,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ei4xivt,False,t3_ayvxhc,,,True,t3_ayvxhc,/r/sportsbook/comments/ayvxhc/pick_of_the_day_3919_saturday/ei4xivt/,1555778432,-5,,True,False,sportsbook,t5_2s3v4,r/sportsbook,public,,,,,,False,False,,,

If you disagree with any picks, please say why, as I'm bored and like having shit to read at the end of the day. Will for sure make a new set of picks on Saturday, this is more or less an exploratory post

Alex Morono v Zak Ottow - Ottow has been KO'd by Leech and Super Sage, the former possessing inhuman power and the latter gassing him out. I'm gonna take a huge leap here and say that Ottow fought like an idiot because it was the first and only time he'll ever be in the spotlight and it made him manic (a la UFC jitters for debutants). Morono doesn't hit that hard, and if Dwight Grant couldn't KO him then only a special few can. Ottow also survived Sergio Moraes' BJJ, so it doesn't look like he's getting submitted. This discussion probably makes it look like I'm saying Ottow will win, I'm not (for the record Morono beating Kenan Song in China was VERY impressive), but it's realistically probably a 50/50 fight so Ottow ML at 2.6 is value

Alex White v Dan Moret - White got manhandled by Jim Miller in 2018. Moret at 2.4

Rocco Martin v Sergio Moraes - Moraes has a history of forgetting about his world class jiu jitsu and throwing hands (which he isn't actually good at). HOWEVER he started using takedowns against Ben Saunders and tapped out an accomplished black belt. Rocco Martin has good hands, Ryan LaFlare couldn't take him down and his jits is okay. Gut says Rocco beat LaFlare and isn't prone to Oliveira-tier gassing so he takes it, although I don't love 1.53 odds

Ben Rothwell v Blagoy Ivanov - We have literally no knowledge of what Rothwell is like off steroids, if he's even off them. Ivanov however hasn't really beaten anyone of note and isn't great at defending chokes. Rothwell submission is probably the go here, else Rothwell ML at 2

Beneil Dariush v Drew Dober - Dariush has said he wants a sub but would settle for a decision and isn't going to fight like an idiot. Dober has said he wants an exciting fight, so will fight like an idiot. 3U Dariush ML, 1U Dober Round 1 KO

Curtis Millender v Elizeu Zaleski Dos Santos - Fuck is this FDNGTD line? Millender is effectively a more powerful Adesanya with literally zero ability to get off his back, Dos Santos constantly throws with power and reckless abandon. Even if Dos Santos gets Millender down, is he expected to wrestlefuck him? Either one of them gets KO'd or Dos Santos gets the choke, at 2.3 this is a must play

Grant Dawson v Julian Erosa - Am I missing something here? Erosa's wrestling isn't awful, his sub defence isn't awful, he's just crazy chinny. Dawson doesn't have that much power in his striking. Erosa ML at 2.5

Jeff Hughes v Maurice Greene - Hughes just beat him like 8 months ago? When was the last time that someone had a rematch less than a year after the first bout and reversed the result? Hughes ML at 1.47

Tim Boetsch v Omari Akhmedov - See below comment

Well, um, i'm back. Came off a really rough day going like 2-7 and the next day had these 3 picks above which I was super confident in. The Cavs and Pistons played each other and it was a 30 point game at halftime, not the script I was looking for, so Osman and Drummond only played like 2 and a half quarters which was quite unfortunate. Tobias was just brutal. Scored 16 in the first half in like 17 minutes, and proceeds to play every fucking minute of the second half, and score 1 point during the first 23 minutes of the half before hitting a 3 and leaving us a bucket short. The amount of usage he got was absurd, and he managed to miss every shot. This like 8u loss over the course of two days absolutely destroyed my morale. Overall, we are over 50% on bets but the units aren't looking to great. Took a few days off to collect myself, but baby we back.

**DeMar DeRozan o12 RA 1.15u @-115**

**LaMarcus Aldridge o21.5 pts 1.2u @-120**

Oh baby, props against the Spurs have treated me well this year, and props on the Spurs have treated me well this year. Just gonna have one blurp on this. So the Spurs on the road have a bad rep, but a large part of that is their defense. Odds are this game is a lot closer than a Spurs-Hawks game should be, but we are going to take advantage of that. The Spurs are coming off back to back wins against the Thunder and Nuggets, are kinda feeling themselves. The implied total for the Spurs this game is around 120, which is high as fuck. This is a beautiful pace up spot for the Spurs who rank 24th in pace, versus an Atlanta team that recently moved into the #1 spot for pace in the NBA. I also love this game because of the injuries going on: Poetl is out, Dedmon is out, Spellman is out. Starting on the Spurs side, the only active big man on the Spurs besides LMA, is two-wayer Drew Eubanks.

* Aldridge is going to be pushing 40 minutes tonight, which he showed he could do a few games ago playing 39 minutes against the Pistons bigs. On the Hawks side, Omari Spellman, the backup PF, and Dedmon, the starting center are both out, leaving a probable John Collins and Alex Len as the two healthy big man (besides Alex Poythress haha). LMA will most likely be starting at C, against Len who is a very average center DRPM ranking in the middle of the 67 eligible players. But because of how short the Hawks are, odds are wee are going to get LMA being guarded by John Collins sometimes, who is the third worst defending PF according to DRPM. Aldridge has hit this point total in 4 straight, including against the Thunder and Nuggets with talented defensive big men in Adams and Jokic, and the Spurs will need him to step up tonight in a depleted matchup.
* DeRozan is averaging 2.6 ppg more on the road this year, has hit this point total in 4/6 since the all star break, and is averaging 22.8-7.2-6 since then as well. Even with White back, he's still a primary ball handler for the team, getting 8, 7, and 7 assists with in the last 3. His RA total since the all-star break is 12, 13, 7, 21, 13, 13, and a game with minimal big men and a high pace is great for the rebound total. He is also going against an Atlanta sf defense that is 7th worst in Defense v Position. Spurs are gonna need their two stars to ball out tonight, and they sure as hell will. At least 2/3 of these props have hit in every game since the All-Star break, let's ride the wave [and then bump this song after he wins you some money.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fpPa7xFpVA)

In the end I believe that Omari has more chances in the long range, and a very good strategy at close range. 

this is what I originally thought of the match

&gt;Broman will receive a lot of sniping hits, none letal as he is expecting to be attacked but nonetheless will be damaged.

Still with or without damage I believe that Broman will eventually find and close the distance. Here he will be at his sauce, Omari is not really good at mid-range fights so it's unlikely that he will be able to attack. Can Omari dodge and protect from Broman attacks? I think so, with 5 points in shooter while they are not low they are certainly not masterclass and thus it's factible to dodge and block them more often than not. In a normal situation Broman would win here if he keeps the pressure but as it's likely that he got trion loss in the previous phases (bullets, and his usage of escudo) it may happen that he loss fuel before winning.

Now Omari has a plan to win once they are close: telport to blank point and shoot. Problem is that his opponent has interceptor and this is not foolproof. I doubt that one would expect from Omari that move. With more speed Omari can easily break a focused shield at so close range but not the escudo if Broman gets time to react properly (without quick switch it would be slower)...

There is no decisive victory to be had in this match.

Broman is doing a good job working with what he has, trying to bait shots from Omari. However, Omari is smart enough to realise that wildly shooting at Broman would expose himself, while Broman is also very careful in not exposing himself for too long by using Escudo for cover.

Damian Lillard/De'Anthony Melton

Jonah Bolden/Omari Spellman (until injured)/Meyers Leonard

Injuries to: De'Anthony Melton (Missed 10 games or so), Omari Spellman (done for season eff 3/1), Victor Oladipo (all of Q3), Wendell Carter Jr (out for season), George Hill (hasn't played since 2/25). Zhaire Smith (likely out for season but JUST STARTED PLAYING IN THE G-LEAGUE SO YEAH!)

Well, I'm not super psyched about the way the season is finishing up. What should've been a contending year was sidetracked when Oladipo went down, and since then, it's been a bit of a trainwreck. 

Major trades messed up chemistry with local favorite and backbone of the Blazers' dart league Joe Ingles and guy who nobody liked but nobody talked about it DeAndre Jordan both being shipped to Houston for a hopeful future franchise cornerstone in Wendell Carter Jr. The fact that he's likely done for the year is not helping matters much this season. 

Also, we've had some players who were showing signs of turning a corner...not actually turn a corner. Semi Ojeleye has barely played after a pretty good December. Juancho has been an absolute trainwreck after looking like a top-15 3 in the league as a starter for like...a big part of the first half of the season. De'Anthony Melton is getting jerked in and out of the lineup in Phoenix after playing decently as a starter. 

But there are bright spots. Landry Shamet is a bright spot. Damian Lillard is playing well. Terry Rozier is a guy. Davis Bertans is another guy. De'Anthony Melton is a guy. Yeah. We'll be better next year.

I don't think either of them is capable of dealing enough damage to decide anything.

Broman doesn't really have the mobility to stay within Shooter range, and even then, his skill is rather sparse.

Omari, on the other hand, tries to stay away from Broman at all costs. This is fine and all, but even with his high skill, he's still a sniper, trying to shoot a fast target, with a lot of cover and an impenetrable shield at his disposal.

The start of the match is Broman looking for his spot to start his strategy and Omari looking for Broman. At this point Either Omari will spot Broman or Broman will begin his ""Look at me I'm on radar"" strategy.  It is at this time that Omari's be patience and stay out of range will dictate the outcome. Omari will not aim for the head but try to reduce Broman's mobility, IMO his patience and Sniper skill is enough to make this happen. At this point even if Broman changes his strategy he will have even less mobility giving Omari an even bigger advantage at long range. Broman will either loose by trion loss not a KO.

This match will end with Broman on the lower side on trion and the 45 minutes will be up before either of them can land a decisive hit. His tactic to confuse omari where he is coming out of will be effective in my opinion which will let him not take any deep shots. Even if broman closes the distance which is unlikely, I see omari holding out for long as 5 is not a lot when it comes to shooting skills and even worse when their opponent has really decent mobility.  Escudo will also be an ultimate defense for broman as Omari can't do anything about it.

It's unfortunate that Broman has 5 for sniper and shooter if that wasn't the case I would definitely vote for Broman. 

As mentioned in the rebuttal, Omari will move away from his location to a safer location. From here on Omari will be able to grasp the pattern of Broman strategy and will use that to his advantage.

While it is likely that the match would be really passive with both OCs playing a safe playstyle, Omari would have the upper edge due to supreme accuracy in comparison to Broman's 5000 points on shooter and sniper triggers, along with the natural terrain not giving the best cover. Omari also has superior mobility, and so betting on dodging enough hounds and then using a hit and run playstyle with Egret would eventually result in Omari's victory.  Shooting Egret multiple times to reduce any chance of pinpoint guard succeeding with the more speed special technique would also be fata to Omari as Egret is quite fast, and a mobility of 8 is high but not enough to close distance while dodging shots.

&amp;#x200B;

It's not that Broman wouldn't be able to win, but that Omari just has pretty much all the win conditions he needs against shooters with his trigger set, other than not being able to pull off a successful double KO in the worst case scenario and full guard from Broman being problematic in any counter attack attempt, though in that case Omari can just continue to make distance, and activate his own bagworm while making distance if Broman happens to equipt Bagworm in a chase, to reset things back to stage one.",True,False,,,,,0,1551798777,,1551839028,0,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",ehue31p,False,t3_awbv68,,,True,t1_eht3p9t,/r/worldtrigger/comments/awbv68/oc_solo_tournament_phase_1_round_8_group_1_omari/ehue31p/,1555502018,1,,True,False,worldtrigger,t5_2xrqd,r/worldtrigger,public,,,,,,False,False,,,

Broman will receive a lot of sniping hits, none letal as he is expecting to be attacked but nonetheless will be damaged. 

Still with or without damage I believe that Broman will eventually find and close the distance. Here he will be at his sauce, Omari is not really good at mid-range fights so it's unlikely that he will be able to attack. Can Omari dodge and protect from Broman attacks? I think so, with 5 points in shooter while they are not low they are certainly not masterclass and thus it's factible to dodge and block them more often than not. In a normal situation Broman would win here if he keeps the pressure but as it's likely that he got trion loss in the previous phases (bullets, and his usage of escudo) it may happen that he loss fuel before winning.

Now Omari has a plan to win once they are close: telport to blank point and shoot. Problem is that his opponent has interceptor and this is not foolproof. I doubt that one would expect from Omari that move. With more speed Omari can easily break a focused shield at so close range but not the escudo if Broman gets time to react properly (without quick switch it would be slower)...

If Broman appears on radar Omari will assume he is being baited (and even if he doesn’t), will move away from this area until he’s out of Lightning’s effective range before he properly observes the area and attempts to shoot. By revealing himself first, Broman allows Omari to go to the maximum distance before shooting and revealing any information about his location, making it extremely hard for Broman to close in and find him.

As Omari sees Broman getting closer (by radar or eyesight) or if Broman disappears from the radar, Omari will assume Broman knows roughly where he is, and will back away from where Broman was last seen, to maintain a large distance between them.

As Broman repeats his strategy, Omari will realise that Broman is focusing on finding him and that he can relocate Broman fairly easily, as Broman has a pattern of taking bagworm off frequently and leaving an obvious path of where he has been (holes in houses, broken windows, open doors), and would prioritise repositioning himself and getting away over shooting. Generally, he would still continue to keep track of him and shoot at him though, forcing Broman to continue using buildings as cover, creating a trail. 

I believe that Omari will be able to maintain the distance between them as their mobility is equal (and Omari has grasshopper) while Broman is slowed by having to remain in cover as well as trying to be unpredictable, meaning he cannot take the fastest route.

Since you do not indicate how you would look for Broman or how to draw him out, I'm assume you are passively looking at him. If so, then it is unlikely you would find Broman before he starts to draw attention within his plan. Once there, you have a hard chance to hit any clean shots. If you change to take more shots to cover, then Broman will have more info to narrow down your locations. 

Whenever Broman finds himself in range, he will hammer Omari with hound and meteora bullets and will drive him down when possible. If he teleports, Broman, with Interceptor, will assume it is the normal distance since Omari hasn't showcased the possibility to augment the distance. Even then Broman will consider short hop will not help in shooter range and long hop is best for running and not counter attacking in a fight. If Broman see the teleport, he will figure out the exit point of a normal teleport and kneel to protect both his head and chest behind a focused shield for the few seconds before a escudo pop up to cover. Any hounds he dodged will probably redirect to Omari's new location and give Broman and few seconds of cover fire to reorient. Also if Omari has to summon to switch guns, that will give more time to Broman to defend himself, quick switch or not.

1) **Preplan and Analysis:** Omari appears to be a dedicated sniper with only two sniper triggers for damage. A sniper fight is not the optimal range to be having the fight so Broman has to hunt down Omari but the sniper will have probably realized this too from Broman's Trigger Info and will expect the chase. Escudo is the biggest advantage Broman has over Omari since he doesn't have any triggers to break them or shoot around and must reposition for clear shots. Teleport and grasshopper can marginalize the problem but he still needs to move, so Broman can use that. Meteor can be used for smokescreens and grenades. Asteroid and Hound can be use for pressure and damage once Omari is found. Chameleon can be use to confuse the senses when switching between cover and open field while closing distance. 

2) **Plan:** Broman will assume Omari will use his mobility to get to a skyscrapper first well before Broman. Broman will assume Omari will first set up in a skycrapper near the middle like the one my Ouji or the mobile sniper a bit more south. Broman will don Shield and Bagman and head straight east from the spawn point. Using the alleyways and houses as his cover, using fences and trees inbetween. His Shield will be at the ready to cover his head and upper chest through a narrow rectangular shape. He will use his experience as a sniper to figure out the optimal Shield size between strength to handle at least one Eglet shot and area to cover Lightning fire. His first goal is to silently head to the point right under that Kurauchi's spawn. 

If Broman is found first, he will hope he could block the opening shot while he dodges into a house or area that blocks line of sight. From wherever he currently is, he will start his plan he was saving till he made it to his goal. 

If Broman makes it to his first waypoint under Kurauchi on the map, then he will start Plan Juggernaut. The starting point is in a normal house and his initial goal line will be the skycrapper right next to the Mobility Sniper. He will then begin running through the house, only to deactivate his Bagworm before his exits the house through a window. He will keep bagworm off till he busts into another house. It doesn't matter if he enters through the door, window, or wall, Broman will take the quickest way in. From the second house onwards he will run around the inner walls, not though them. He will occasionally run to the the second floor of houses to jump from the second floor windows or through the second floor walls. If Broman feels he does not have enough cover between cover, then he will dive into a roll and activate his Escudo to block the sight lines danger from. Once in a new house/building, his Bagworm will be put back on to cover up his movement inside. He will activate Bagworm again once outside and will rinse and repeat this sequence till he can roughly zero in on where Omari is and head towards him with this plan. Broman will focus on the radar while inside cover to notice blimps of where Omari is when he changes triggers and momentary drops bagworm to switch from offence to mobility. 

The point of this plan is to use the houses as cover while baiting out sniper shots. Since Broman will be in the open and will have dropped his bagworm to draw Omari's attention. If he is a good sniper, then he will know where Broman is real quick. Omari will then know Broman is moving through buildings, possibility to him and will take aim. I am not running through walls in a straight line because a sniper could figure out the timing to hit me once Broman is clear outside. By using the inner ways and stairs to vary the entry and exit timing will cause Omari to mess up the timing for any shots he might take. Having Bagworm on while inside to make sure he isnt tracking Broman inside to shoot through thinner walls or window he is about to pass. Having Bagworm off outside is to allow Omari know where Broman is and bait out shots or catch him between triggers to reposition. The more shots and forced repositions Broman makes Omari do will give more info to find him. 

If Broman hasn't been sniped to hell and back and make it to Omari, then the Second phase can happen. Once Omari is in Shooter range, Broman's chance to win has come! Broman will open combat will Hound (2p/4s/4r) to put Omari on the defense while Broman can use up his shield. Hound will keep pressure on Omari through grasshopper and teleporter and should track once bagworm is down to have the upfront fight. Omari will run to keep distance, probably with Lightning out to provide himself covering fire. Eglet might come out, so Broman will keep in mind the gun switching and will change shield to a focus one it that happens. After a few hounds, Broman will launch Meteora (4p/3s/3r) a few times directly at Omari for smoke and few Meteora(4p/3s/3r) at the area around Omari for splash damage. Broman will then start mix ups where he shattershots Meteora(5p/2s/3r) then use Hound(1p/4s/4r) on the same routes to set off Meteora midair. Broman's ultimate goal though is to push and catch Omari near the ground to use Spring Wall before going full offense where he scattershots the air above the walls with Asteroid(3p/4s/3r) while firing several Hound (4p/2s/4r), then to top it off I fire off a whole cube of Meteora(4p/3s/3r) and let it impact another one of bullets to my set if off a tad early for the shock wave to hit.

Did they think the injury was going to be healed by the playoffs, or did they think it wasn't a big deal? Because as of now, that pick is pretty much useless at the moment. This has been a puzzling choice on the part of the FO. If they wanted a project, they should have just picked Omari Spellman or Mitchell Robinson. But they chose Evans because he was supposed to be able to play now. What happened?

As for needing an upgrade to Shaun, the guy should have been used as a trade chip, along with picks, if the Warriors had any indication that the guy was not going to be able to cut it in the playoffs this year. This is what I'm talking about when I say I wanted to see some aggressiveness from the FO. I'm going to lean on the idea that Shaun is just going through the same motions he did last season, and will pick it up in the playoffs.
