So I’m on the USA east coast. Lost Lands 2019 was my first EDM/bass music festival. And lemme tell you what… that opened the door for me to see what’s possible. 80-100K headbangers (lemme say that again) HEADBANGERS who know how to get down and have a good time.

I love Lost Lands and that year will always hold a special place in my heart. I’ve been to LL 19, LL Reunion (during Covid), LL 22, and Shambhala 23 (this year).

Here’s the main differences I can tell you about:
LL:
-merch is a HUGE part of American EDM culture so that makes an impact
-it is commercial so yes Alcohol is overpriced 
-food cost can vary but is generally overpriced for the quality/quantity of food
-they’ve added more and more stages and soundcamps
-more stages allows for more artists. And a bigger budget to book more
-the hardest pill to swallow (not as PLUR as shambs 💔) with MANY new people coming every year without intention of safe raving and desire to lookout for others ( Brads and Chads)
-expensive to book with the price of ticket separate from camping (especially if you don’t have ppl to split the camping cost)
-the security line has always been great and fast(unlike the lifetime of a wait for Shambs as ya know)

Shambhala from my experience:
-20K people or so if I’ve got that right? So the crowd is smaller
- not every person is a headbanger so not really much moshing or neck breaking occurs. ( lack of rails contributes too)
-THE FOOD 😍 so affordable and better IMO
-the stage design IMO is slightly better though X does pour $$ into his production very much so for LL. Just nicer to have only 6 stages to focus on instead of all the extra spaces.
- People aren’t obsessed over getting merch and I LOVE IT. More creative outfits and less gentrification of EDM wear. Plus the wallet can appreciate it too. 
- the river. BLESSED to have it. Legend valley is great but boy it can be rough walking for miles and miles in a weekend without any water to cool off
-general festival size is manageable for most. LL is kinda bigger than ever and absolutely huge.
-the PLUR vibes I got blessed with by my farmily were unmatched. Not that LL doesn’t have any but with the variety of newcomers and others without care for your own existence I have to give it to the farm for this 💪. **Oh yeah I’ve had my phone stolen at Lost Lands, but we won’t get into that**

- the river. BLESSED to have it. Legend valley is great but boy it can be rough walking for miles and miles in a weekend without any water to cool off
-general festival size is manageable for most. LL is kinda bigger than ever and absolutely huge.
-the PLUR vibes I got blessed with by my farmily were unmatched. Not that LL doesn’t have any but with the variety of newcomers and others without care for your own existence I have to give it to the farm for this 💪. &lt;strong&gt;Oh yeah I’ve had my phone stolen at Lost Lands, but we won’t get into that&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s my lil comparison. From someone who’s an avid raver and tryna go to all the worlds fests that I can. I hope it helps. DM if I can help answering any questions!!&lt;/p&gt;

I will say that like the other commenter mentioned, you will basically be surrounded by Soundcamps on all sides. And these sound camps will go until 8am the next morning.

This past year elements fell short on directions and signage (mostly for the vibe villages) and I heard a lot of people had trouble navigating the camping maps and how to find certain camps. Hoping they will fix that next year.

(Which I know isn’t going to happen bc money). Went for the first time last year and had an absolutely magical time. I can’t even begin to describe how perfect last year was for me. It was like I found the perfect festival lineup/capacity/vibe everything. This year felt a bit lackluster. I still had an amazing time and still felt the amazing vibes but the new set up is just not it. Fire and earth in the gravel is terrible. It’s like those stages lost their entire personality. Plus dancing on gravel was so rough on my feet. don’t get me wrong I love the upscaled production but man the stages in the forest last year felt so much more intimate and magical.  

Pros: the sound quality at all the stages was nice (minus the sound bleed obviously) i loved how far I could be from any of the stages and still hear it perfectly and feel the bass. 
The art is awesome. The air stage was still beautiful as ever and loved just walking around in the forest. The vibes were still awesome, was so pleasantly surprised at how nice people were moving though the crowds. Met so many amazing people. &amp; honestly the bathrooms were very clean all weekend!!! Always had toilet paper &amp; there was always soap and paper towel. 

Cons: 1) no chill spots outside the forest / basically the entire layout outside the forest. Earth stage had the same issue fire had last year. Trying to move in and out was awful. Couldn’t even stand in the back and chill bc that was literally the only spot people could get past. 2) Security/planning. I don’t understand why the hell the people directing traffic were forcing everyone to turn right at will call. Luckily my group just ignored the guy and drove past but like what the hell. It was an entire shit show that could’ve been avoided very easily. Security in/out of the festival grounds. I understand they want to be strict bc of what happened at other festis this year but they were taking it too far. Spending 5+ minutes per person ripping though every pocket and item and being assholes about stuff for no reason. saw a girl in front of me get yelled at for bringing in a flashlight no bigger than my thumb. It was on a key ring (probs just her personal keys) and she was struggling to get it off and the lady was just yelling at her the whole time. The inconsistencies in security really got on my nerves. 
3) Soundcamps. Last year I was camped close to them so I knew to expect the loud music but this year was sooo soooo much worse. There were twice as many and my group camp was surrounded by at least 3. I didn’t get but maybe 8 hours of sleep the entire weekend. I’m not expecting it to be quiet or for people to not play music. I do think the soundcamps are dope. I just wish there was a better way to have the soundcamps located a bit further if they are playing until sunrise every day. Sunday night was awful. It was like every camp turned up their bass to max volume. Was dealing w someone having a panic attack and even sitting in the car it was like we were being rattled by bass haha. Twas a bit much. 4) lastly the vendors. Not sure if this was an elements thing or vendors thing, but fuck that tip screen. I didn’t even know until Saturday night you could skip that screen. I got breakfast one morning and this dude literally slopped some old tater tots &amp; eggs onto a plate and handed it to me and it was like $30 and I’m like why would I tip 18% for that?!?! Everything was entirely way to expensive. I understand festivals will always be stupid expensive but this year was just too much.

Kinda going backwards with my response, but what you're doing with the playlists is what I'm trying to do right now myself. That's one area I haven't really experimented with much until now. I've created a couple spotify playlists with mostly my production, and I'm working on getting people to save/follow them. I've never ran ads on social media but from what you described it seems like it can be cost effective. What I do is just pin a playlist to my Artist Pick and it picks up a few follows per day. My long-term goal is to get a few playlists with thousands of followers and then monetize them by becoming a playlist curator for PlaylistPush/SubmitHub/etc. As for your specific questions:

(1) I stuck with PlaylistPush just because that's the one I tried first based on reviews, and their playlists seem to be pretty high quality overall - no botted streams. I've made accounts with SubmitHub and SoundCamps but just never committed $$ to them. SoundCamps seemed like I was spending a LOT more to pitch to fewer playlists compared to PP.

(2) I kinda mix what I shop to rappers vs my self-published discography. Most of the stuff I shop for major label placements I keep off Spotify. I haven't run into any pitfalls as far as distributing the same beats that I shop to artists, BUT that's because I also don't use Content ID on anything. I deliberately keep everything out of Google/Meta Content ID because then everyone who uses a beat will start getting copyright strikes on YT/FB/IG etc. One of the main things that helped my beats go viral was YouTubers using my beats off SoundCloud in their videos. I allow all my beats to be downloaded for free and used with credit. I probably wouldn't be where I am today if I didn't have my whole catalog basically free on SoundCloud. When I sell a beat to a local/indie artist what they're essentially paying for is the extended HQ beat + stems.

(3) I think building playlists of your music is a great idea, as I discussed before, that's something I am working on. People tend to have short attention spans and usually can't be bothered to click through your discography and explore all of your releases in-depth. So putting your music in a more digestible format like a playlist I think would definitely improve your engagement and algorithmic scores.

My top-performing tracks on Spotify have popularity scores around 50%. In the last year or so, I've noticed a positive feedback loop occurring where my songs are heavily recommended to users in algorithmic playlists (mainly Radio), then they like/share/playlist the song, which causes the rank to go higher, which causes more engagement, etc. So I think I've finally got the sweet spot of Spotify popularity where the algorithm is recommending me to basically anyone listening to instrumental hip hop.

As the horror struck family pulls the trigger, the torch ignites, and a flame appears from a very melted pocket pussy.

One family member starts to sob.  “She didn’t even smoke.”

Ahhh.  Burning man and the stuff we treasure that no one can quite understand unless they have seen the magic of a bottle cap art display or the magic sounds of a squeaky toy on a bike.

So I feel for you.  And hopefully the old hat is off on adventure.  It could end up on a scarecrow or in a cherished collection of burner stuff.

I’ve held on to cups that burners left at my bar for years only to give them back out to burners who lost a cup.

I was very nervous as I had no idea what to expect, got to the gates and had to wait for a pretty good while before even getting to my site, but that has improved a lot over the years. All that waiting is worth it the moment you fell that first wave of bass hit your chest, there's nothing else quite like it. Lost Lands is as hyped up as it is for a reason, there's no other place like it on earth. Its my true happy place on this earth so much so that me and my wife got married there in 2019 by wompy woods during a marauda set by a dinosaur statue.

What to expect: Heavy dubstep and bass all weekend long, some of the coolest humans you will ever meet, PLUR is such a good mindset. Also you will see more ass than you have ever seen in your life lol.

What to look forward to: Honestly the same as what to expect, great music and people.

What to be wary of: I've personally never had it happen to me but theft is sometimes a problem from what ive seen on this reddit and heard from people, but if you keep stuff inside your tent and coolers and valuables locked away in vehicles then you should be good, I also wear a fanny pack so no one can take anything out of my pockets.

Trading things: Some people like to trade things, for instance kandi which are the bracelets people make, some people might also trade some other things M for L or something like that if you know what I mean.

What do we do here: Start you mornings by eating breakfast and getting ready for the day like normal then you walk to the festival grounds, once gates open you find the stage the artist you want to see is at and enjoy the show, be it dance, headbang, mosh, sit on the ground (not in the pit I hope) whatever it is as long as you are having fun and youre not hurting anyone then you do you. Main shows go from 2pm-Midnight then soundcamps open from midnight to 4 am

What are sound camps you might ask: sound camps are just smaller stages around the festival with reduced volume due to time and noise ordinance I assume, in my opinion the djs that play these stages are usually lesser known djs but do not let that make it seem like they go any less hard or will be any less heavy.

If you have any questions just ask me also on the website they have checklists of stuff you will need to bring, be prepared for any situation, I hope this helps.

Anyways, while I kinda understand your point, I do not agree and I think lost lands is consistently trying to find new music. The crowd is not very accepting of different genres so gotta give it time. But they literally have artist workshops and X does sweepstakes and challenges for new artists. Give credit where it's due.

Favorite: Electric Forest

&amp;#x200B;

Lost Lands: I might get shit for this one, but I went in 2018 and had WAY too many problems - most of which were avoidable. People were dropping because of heat stroke, and the festival had maybe one dinosaur installation's worth of shade for 40,000 people raging in 90+ degree weather. The water station lines were so bad by Day 2 that I bought water and handed it out for the entire weekend. Also saw ambulances driving up to the soundcamps every night, and more overdoses than I had seen at every other festival combined. On the last night, staff told us we all had to get out as soon as possible due to ""bad weather"" that never came. They fucked us over with the shuttle schedules by changing the times last minute out of nowhere, leaving us all less than two hours to pack up everything and get out in the middle of the night with everyone scrambling. I heard someone almost got ran over in their tent because of this. The music was incredible and I had the time of my life, but I would never willingly go through that again.

Electric Forest: Where do I even start. Forest is another world - a sanctuary of love, color, art, freedom, and music. The first place I ever really felt at home. The first place where I learned how to let go. The place where I met the love of my life. There's so much to do and look at that you could really spend the whole weekend exploring if you wanted to. The high fives in the lines, the way the forest glows at night, the hundreds of memories and friends you make every year...it'll forever be worth the trip. The music is just a bonus, but whoever curates the lineup knows exactly what they're doing. This is the kind of festival where you don't really need to have any artists in mind to check out, because you can just wander around and find a new underrated one you like. A lot of them are not very well known or up-and-coming, but extremely talented. The multigenre aspect is great, as well. You can lay in the grass to some jam, headbang to some dubstep, get weird to some experimental bass, then party to house music till the sun comes up.

We're using playlist sites, like Submit.hub, running Facebook ads and have a full press &amp; radio campaign too.

Payment is an issue with fake playlists but not the only indicator. I can understand a playlist taking a smaller fee (even if i don’t like it) if it’s for growing the playlist for all musicians using ads. But i would like proof of that. 

I have tried Submithub but never Soundcamp. 

There is mixed feelings for Submithub. It is a smart tool in the way intended. To reach blogs, curators and influencers using one site. Even before the music is released! However, i feel that a lot decline your material and leave a very lame feedback just to earn the credit. I reach far better success pitching my music directly to blogs or curators.   
 Some will refer you to Submithub anyway, but then you have at least established a contact which have showed to increase the approval rate for me. 

My best advice is to use the hot or not feature as a very neat way to earn free premium credits making the investment more about your time than your money. Which takes away the feeling of paying to get heard. But also we have to be real and understand that exposure and marketing isn’t all free. 

I would not use Submithub solely to market my music, of course. It’s a tool like everything else. I do find myself more frustrated than satisfied while pitching using Submithub because of what i wrote above.

As a final Submithub tip - I think that site are better for pitching to influencers to get like a story share or tiktok feature. They have a higher approval rate and you get some exposure. If you rate some fellow musicians using the hot or not feature, the pitch would only cost you some time. You can also request to receive votes and feedback on your own music which have gotten me a few playlists placements and followers.",,,,,False,False,[],True,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_la8e78,,,False,/r/musicmarketing/comments/la8e78/fake_playlists_part_2/glum09a/,public,False,t1_glum09a,,,[],1612351408.0,,0,,,,,,1571933972.0,,1626834466.0,,,,

You can see a giant tractor/forklift/cherry picker parked right next to the “Central Plaza.” Maybe it’s an art car?? More likely just an eyesore.

The livestream was basically a propaganda campaign aiming to convince those that couldn’t go that it was awesome and that everyone there was super stoked and thought it was wonderful. They went around asking people on camera what they thought about the event and their body language did not really match up with what they were saying, which were good things. People looked slightly defeated and let down. The team that was vending looked frustrated that they drove their gas guzzling bus all the way out there because they probably didn’t turn a profit.

So it's in a teeny tiny yee yee town in Arkansas (no rideshare), and to get to the festival you gotta drive up part of a mountain. The crowd was small and super friendly, music/sound quality was mindblowing from the headliners down to the 5am soundcamp artists. You can tell Liquid took the time to find the best underground sound. There were a small amount of art installations near one of the soundcamp stages, a lil set of trees to put up hammocks in. It was insanely easy to get to the stages from the camps, lots of room to dance around, a few good food and hippie vendors. It doesn't really compare to any other festival I've been to, but gem &amp; jam is a good size comparison, I think.

I was expecting the fest to have a lot of kinks not worked out yet since it was the first year, but I was absolutely AMAZED at how smooth everything was. You can tell a lot of love and hard work was put into the fest. Go if you're really only lookin for some dirty, wonderful Wakaan sound and hard-to-catch, multigenre, underrated artists with the Wakaan family. But I will say that there isn't a lot to do outside of music, not much art, and a few nature-related things are a pain in the ass (driving up and down a mountain, rocks stabbing your feet, long walks between soundcamp stages, rocky camping area).

If you're looking for a corporate fest full of activities, this is not for you. If you just wanna be a stanky mountain wook for a weekend and discover some great new music, welcome to the family.

We can have a more low key burn without the bells and whistles and I think it may well be richer for it. That will be worthwhile and healing for many.

It's all dependent on the type of experience you want and how you like your ""home"" life to be. if you were to camp near the soundcamps on the edges of the city (9:30-10, 2-2:30) then things are definitely way louder at night and potentially a little less crazy during the day. 

At night, the areas around 6 o'clock can sometimes feel like when you're in the mall and the stores have all closed but you can still walk around. 

There's no one part of the city that's better than others (although I say the 9 o'clock sector is actually the best!) it's all driven by personal exploration and desires. There are AMAZING camps on the esplanade, and also AMAZING camps out on K in the suburbs. Every year the city is different and every year, visiting a camp is different, even if you've been there before. 

The dynamism of the city is created by the fact that unlike, say, going to a Starbucks anywhere  where the experience is largely similar and undifferentiated, no matter where you are, on playa going from one camp to another can be divergently different and engaging. That's what makes the city unique and engaging. 

The action is not in any one part of the city, the action IS the city. YOU are where all the action happens. At the end of the day, where you camp is just a location where you sleep eventually. There are super fun, interesting, engaging camps and activities in every part of the city, on every block.

1. Yes it’s undoubtedly undergoing a cultural shift, though that’s been happening since the 90s. Unfortunately for the culture and event, the shift happening today is leading to some pretty indisputably bad things like more garbage by the roads. From my perspective the shift is mostly a result of the mainstreaming of the event in popular culture. It’s become a checklist item for the music festival crowd, quite unfortunately.

2. If nighttime feels like EDC to you it’s entirely because of how and where you spend your time on the playa. It feels nothing like EDC to me because I don’t really go to soundcamps any more (and I stay well away from Mayan Warrior etc) except to briefly marvel at how their scale increases every year. I spend my time at smaller camps in the city where you get more community than people trying to be part of a scene. One way isn’t better than another or anything, but if you spend your time at EDC-type places out there, that’s the experience you’re going to have.

Last year I was Tier 3 VIP:  $269.00  +  $67.29  for Service Fees

I was in Dino Den:  $249.00 +  $73.47 .

I also paid  for Thursday Arrival: $49.00 + $12.24 for Service Fees (gets you into Pre-Party)

I don't think Ult covers the camping, but i'll get into that bit in a second.

Versus regular VIP (LAST YEAR, this might change): You're going to get a bunch of merch ($400 worth), and some exclusive merch no one else can buy during or after LL. A meet and greet with Excision, and access to the BBQ backstage on one of the days.  


VIP in the venue vs GA gets: Exclusive viewing areas to the side of both stages, with their own vending and bars, climate controlled bathrooms, and your own VIP lane for getting into the venue (I never waited more than 5 min to get in).  


Camping: Dino Den is closer to the venue, and supposed to have their own water fill stations, bathrooms, and exclusive showers.  On paper, it's grand. For the experience: a lot of things didn't go right, and for some of it, no amount of planning would've been able to fix it. I personally felt screwed over when I was tossed into the overflow dino den 2 area that didn't have any of the amenities of the Dino Den 1 area. I was essentially GA+, with closer access to the venue over the latter half of regular GA (if you look at the map). Doesn't mean that won't be fixed this year, but I bring it up simply because things may not always go exactly right.

&amp;#x200B;

GA WAS closer to the soundcamps, the place to be after the venue closed. RV is right at the front of GA, so just as close to about everything.

&amp;#x200B;

For the venue: at least go VIP imo. The climate control bathrooms were sooooo nice, and never was there a line that took more than 2 min (for guys). I'm hoping for Prehistoric Paradox they add a water filling station, but when water is $2 a bottle, it's not a huge deal to pay for one.

&amp;#x200B;

For Camping: regardless y ou should be buying Thurs arrival.  It'll get you as close as possible to the venue. I'd still recommend DD, because my complaints will likely (and hopefully) have been addressed for this year. I'm going to make an attempt at RV myself, because I want to be smack dab in the middle of Sound Camps and venue walk. Gonna rent one.

Be mindful this year is at the end of Sept, so nights may get down to 30ish degrees like it did year 1.

I am sure you have heard numerous rumors about things that happened at Lost Lands. Even with all the negativity about last year, I had an absolute blast. If Lost Lands could figure out their security issues and had more amenities for campers, it would have been a damn near perfect festival experience for me. 

The ONE thing that Lost Lands had on Electric Forest was the sound system. My god. Both stages rocked my soul to the core, especially during Kai Wachi and Snails (Bassnectar on a Lost Lands stage would be fucking insane by the way...)

As far as stage production, Lost Lands won that round. Forest obviously has more stages, but LL had suuuuper crispy screens and as I mentioned, the sound was perfect (Bassnectar's sound guy, Kyle, ran the sound booth for LL)

Size was pretty similar. Lost Lands felt like it had a ton more people because they had to increase the size of the venue for the capacity this year. However, getting through security was a breeze going into the venue. A lot faster than Forest (unless you have FitF)

Electric Forest has dope ass RV sets, LL has dope ass Soundcamp sets. The soundcamps at Lost Lands were soooo gnarly. One of the coolest experiences of my life

One thing that makes Electric Forest stand far above any festival is the amount of space you have to fuck around. The Forest is HUGE and full of mysteries that you will never experience everything in one weekend. There weren't any real mysteries at Lost Lands minus some secret sets. Not much to explore. 

If you have the opportunity, I would definitely do both! As long as you can handle heavy ass dubstep for a whole weekend, then you can definitely handle Lost Lands. 

If you had to choose one over the other, I'd choose Forest, of course :]

Soundcamp, Samsung's GarageBand basically.

&gt;I was also just about to ask if the font was default because it looked too familiar lmao, good job

Man, it was not easy. Replacing the system fonts is a piece of cake if you have root access, technically, but figuring out what needs to be replaced and how, as well as actually getting the font ready . . . The in game font was based on a font you can get online but that version had a bunch of errors that the game fixed. The game also made some changes (not error fixes) that I had to edit into the pack as well. The font also came with extremely limited characters which I had to expand to make it at least usable for day to day phone use (for instance, every colon in the Dominos app was actually a different unicode character similar to a colon, so I had to copy that over; many accented varieties of characters were missing, so I had to frankenstein those together; etc.). To make matters more complicated, some UI elements in Samsung's Android uses specific font files with weird character layouts (e.g. the clock uses a font that has numbers repeated with different amounts of white space before/after the character, and other weird placeholder characters). I also wanted standard formatting to show up, so I created all the necessary bold, italic, bold italic, thin, thin italic, condensed, condensed bold, etc. variation files as well. Between the formatting and special use files, I had to create and replace over 2 dozen different font files to get everything to show up the way I want it to, and even then, due to the extremely limited character set I started with, most anything you can't type with a standard keyboard displays placeholder boxes. I'd never done any kind of font creation/editing before this, not to mention I'm not really someone who's artistically (drawing anyway) inclined at all, so it was quite the achievement for me, and I felt satisfactorily accomplished :D

For starters, go to Galaxy Apps and find the exclusives tab. Here you'll find the Samsung Apps and extras such as Soundcamp and the Optical Reader. You'll also get updates to the core Samsung apps (Messages, Phone, Voice Recorder, etc.) through this app instead of the Google Play Store so make sure to check for updates through Galaxy Apps also.

If you're in the US, UK or some other countries you can also download Good Lock 2018 from the Galaxy App Store. If not, you'll have to sideload the apps. Here's an archive with all the Good Lock Apps:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/10E3XizVMw-A8xSP7_rd_w29V7UbH_pAr/view?usp=drivesdk

Good Lock allows you to customize your device even further, from little things like hiding the alarm icon from the notification panel to changing the Recent Apps screen UI, gestures, lockscreen and notification dropdown customization. It's a must.

Note that the apps get updates so if you're gonna sideload make sure to search for the app name + ""Samsung"" and download the latest apk from apkmirror from time to time. There's also another app called 'MultiStar' which is not in the archive, it requires min Android 8.1 to work (GS9/Note9 for now) and basically allows you to take multitasking a step further.

I also used this:

https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s8+/themes/fonts-wings-samsung-fonts-1200-root-t3710688

to have access to thousands of extra fonts. I really only did it for the SamsungOne font, IMO it's the best font out there and such a shame Samsung doesn't use it on their phones. If you're going to check it out, which I recommend, use the ADB Method, It's free and doesn't need to be re applied every restart.

bxActions (Google Play) allows you to remap the Bixby button, I have mine set to flashlight on lockscreen and toggle immersive mode (no other way to do it) when using the phone and I still use Bixby by holding the button. You can remap for a single press, double press, single press and hold, and hold. However for the latter Bixby might interfere. Oh you can also remap the volume buttons if you wish.

Make sure to explore the settings app as there are some nice features. Also enabling developer mode will allow you to do things like modify animation speeds, force apps to be resizeable, written to SD Card etc. Be careful though, some settings can mess with things.

Then there's custom launchers and keyboards but I prefer the Samsung options.

Then you can also look into system wide adblocking (search Blokada on XDA), modded app clients (YouTube Vanced, Spotify, etc.), Tasker, etc. No root needed.

It might take some time to get all this setup but trust me, it will make using your device a MUCH MUCH more pleasurable experience. Feel free to ask more questions.

Pros:

Food- those buffalo chicken tacos from the avocado place outside the sound camps were so good I almost cried haha. They brought me back to life Sunday morning.

Medical - I had to hail down a cart for someone who passed out coming up on something. They moved incredibly fast and were 100% on top of their shit.

Volunteers and generous neighbors - Even though water wasn’t super accessible the community as a whole made up for it. Everyone was looking out for each other for the most part.

People - these things always make me feel better about people in general. Yeah there are some career criminals that come to these things that are for sure scum bags selling gross things and looking to screw people over... but in my experience that is the 0.01%. Thanks to all my fellow headbangers for exchanging sweaty hugs!

Sound/Music - this one should go without saying for anyone who went. Between the lineup and sound quality I was so incredibly impressed. Those soundcamps were amazing.

 As for the other claims, yes several people online have reported loosing a friend by the soundcamps and a girl on Friday. I even said these other ones WERE NOT 100% confirmed since there was no names and it wasn't clear who was who. And sorry, but no, often times numbers of deaths dont hit the news until after. I can't believe you are making this stupid argument right now.

 Given the amount of differing reports it would stand to reason that it wasn't just 1 person, especially considering the amount of people who have spoken to staff and EMT and gotten a higher number than 1. So we have 1 confirmed for sure, but it's likely to be more IMO. If you disagree then idgaf; go find something useful to put energy into instead of debating whether people are lying about their friends dying wtf. You literally are all over this sub right now arguing that there hasn't been any deaths when it's obvious there has been at least 1, and possibly more.

I’m going to be totally real with you – I live in Western Canada, and I will have already gone to three festivals (possibly four) before The Big Burn rolls around. The cost of a ticket made the trip out of budget this year, but I could scrape by with that cost covered!

**What I'll do to make BRC a better place:**

I work in entertainment – professionally in the film and stage industry, side gigs in music (Djing/producing). I have some friends who work in the same industries heading to the burn this year, and I would be so stoked to be able to help them out with their soundcamp. I also strive to make myself as available as possible to people who look like they might need a hand or just a friend in these community/festival type events.

**Something wonderful:**

One of the festivals I attended this year was Freezer Burn – the regional Burner event for Alberta. It was my second year attending, and my camp and I brought out a tiny nightclub on a trailer we titled ‘BYOBerghain’. The cost of building and bringing a whole soundstage was a bit more than we anticipated, so any plans to make it to BRC due to the cost of a ticket. Through this, I learned a TON about budgeting, self reliance, and working together to make a singular dream come true. It was amazing, and we had such a wonderful response from the community.

**Nice, Wholesome Fact:**

Cats sleep about 70% of the time, compared to humans 30%. A man can dream, can't he?

**Favorite baby animal picture:**

[Lil baby Pallas' Cats](https://i.imgur.com/HwAfwt3.jpg)! Even when they're adults, they're tiny!

**Pinkie Swear:**

You know it, sister/brother/gender fluid sibling. I'll be there in my finest cat attire.

**Burning Man Prep:**

I own a 1986 Okanagan Camper Van. It holds 10 gallons of water, has an efficient propane fridge and cooktop, and a bathroom. I’m fully festival prepped already – including a folding bicycle purchased with the intent of taking it to BRC last year, but things didn’t pan out. I’ve got a half decent savings account that I’m very willing to dive into to make my way south.  I would also look around the local Burner community to see who I could share a ride with to help out with gas. Having already driven 1500 KMs in my van this season, I’m well aware of the gas cost of the 3600 KM round trip.

I was an experienced burner and partier who wasn't careful. I was given a pill on burn night by a friend who told me they knew its source and had taken it before and had a great time. This turned out to be not true. Later they said they actually had no idea where that pill came from and weren't paying attention to which pill I had picked out. Lesson learned: trust a testing kit more than any friendship. Back to the story: I found myself alone at dawn, having visual hallucinations (the melty kind like with psychedelics, which should not have been happening), auditory issues (like everyone was talking in slow motion), freaking out, having the shits, paranoid, my limbs wouldn't stop trembling, I had a hard time moving. It was awful. I was at a big sound camp, dragging myself to the portos, looking for safety, scared. Naked, lost my bag, no friends, no friendly faces. This soundcamp had Zendo connected to it, I saw the people holding the Zendo sign, but I couldn't figure out how to make the connection and tell them. This went on from dawn until it was getting hot. After another trip to the portos, I stumbled in a shaded cozy corner and laid down, unable to move. After a while this young woman sat next to me. I mustered up all my everything and asked her to help me, help get me to Zendo or any help. She looked me in the eye and told me that only I could help myself and refused to help me. She said that the goddess would help me, and then she pulled out a little tea light candle and lit it. For me, she said. She left after a while. I stopped trying to seek Zendo or help then, because in my altered state I believed her, that there was no help for me, that I had to help myself. After many hours tripping out under huge Alex Grey tapestries, I decided to go to the Temple and find respite. I walked there. Got there super dehydrated, and of course the Temple was roped off for it's upcoming demise. I decided to give up, and found Rangers. They were nice, gave me water and offered company and conversation, but I was still too out of it and paranoid. I asked for medical. They radioed and a huge pickup with a huge man driving. He said he was a Ranger, but to my paranoid mind I thought he was a cop and trying to hide it from me. Instead of driving straight to the closest medic station, we took a few detours, including him talking with a woman about the costume he'd had her sew for him. It was bizarre. We get to medic station I think around the 9 keyhole, and they do a quick assessment, see I'm not in medical emergency, give me a cup of gator-aide and ignore me. After an hour, I leave. I start walking all the way across the playa to my camp. I was naked, with no shoes, and no bag, and no water, and still not in my right mind. A super excellent janky small artcar comes up to me, driver is an off shift Ranger who very much wants to help me. He drops me off at camp. 15 hours after ingesting and I'm still altered. It took another 24 hours to stop having visual hallucinations and get back to baseline.

Lessons here:

1.Don't take something without testing it.  
2.Don't carry around pills that you haven't tested and offer them to friends.  
3.Don't tell someone who asks for help that you can't help them, no one can help them, they just need to pray.  
4.If you see a naked, shit covered, shoeless person on the playa, assume they may need kindness and help of services.  
5.Every burn is the first one, don't get cocky.  
6. If you want to get to Zendo, simply go to Zendo or ask multiple people to get you there.",,,,,,,[],False,,,,,False,,True,t3_8rvgcb,,dark,False,/r/BurningMan/comments/8rvgcb/id_like_to_hear_about_bad_psychedelic_trips_on/e0uo8ft/,public,,,,I'm a sparkly phony!,,1529290320.0,,0,,,,,,,1532659162.0,,,,,markdown

You've should have bought a Pixel instead of a samsung phone because every Oem has its own apps.

Apart from that samsung apps are way better than google apps if you try using them instead of criticizing them i.e samsung internet is way better than chrome.

Last but not the least system wide password manager i.e Samsung pass and samsung flow or slide sync for seamless connectivity with your desktops.

Samsung skin is way too feature rich i.e features like adapt sound, link sharing, enhanced messaging (Imessage alternative by samsung) and so on.

My advice to you is that you should give your S9 fare bit of time using and checking all its features and if you still think that samsung fails you. You should change to a pixel hope this helps.

t5_2qlqh,,,,False,,,,,,,Android,,,,,,dum44iq,,,0,,,,professorTracksuit,,,t1_dum25f7,1,,,,,,"&gt;I used the original 7-inch Galaxy Tab and the 10.1 inch Galaxy Tab 2 (from like 2012, I believe?).

The Tab S2 was released on Sep, 2015. 

&gt;Those two devices and the Galaxy S3 made me swear off Samsung completely for Android. I'm saying this as someone who has multiple family members who work at Samsung's headquarters including two engineers, one of them very senior, at their mobile division.

I don't like their phones, but their Android tablets are pretty good and easily the best Android tablets (with the exception of the Pixel C). The Tab S2 and S3 even support Samsung's Professional Audio so you can get some very good low latency audio performance if you're into that sort of thing. It also comes with a very competent music creation app called SoundCamp that is very similar to Garage Band. 

&gt;I'm open to trying things if it's convenient, but I really don't appreciate how my only two options here are ""I like Samsung tablets"" or ""I'm being ridiculous/disingenuous/just plain ignorant"". While I'm not discounting the possibility I might like using them, I also think that I may try them and still in good faith dislike the experience, knowing myself and my relationship with Samsung's Android devices.

Samsung's tablet software isn't that bad. With the exception of the Pixel C it's probably the best of the rest. Even though I'm running Android Nougat, I just got the Jan 2018 security patch so they do update it every so often, but not as frequent as their current flagship phones. One thing I do like about it is the insane windowing capabilities of this thing. You can pretty much window nearly every app. Don't have YouTube Red to play YouTube in the background or put it in a windows - doesn't matter it'll do it for you. Just try one. You have nothing to lose and you can return it within the return window. They are expensive, but it is a 9.7"" OLED panel and the battery life is very good and on par, if not better, than my iPad. I actually use my Tab S2 more than my iPad because of how versatile it is.

I didn’t really get into “raves” proper until the mid 2000s though after I moved to San Francisco around the time dubstep and electro house were becoming a thing. There was a free party called Lovefest that went through downtown SF - a bunch of floats playing electronic music would parade down Market st (and the public could join in too) then set up around a park and it would be a stationary part until sunset. Lovely experience ~

I also started going to afterparties hosted by Burning Man soundcamps and eventually I found out about the Oakland underground scene and free parties in North Bay playing hardcore and jungle and techno and all the rave goodness in the Bay Area overall ~ galaxyraver and throwing warehouse parties with help from that forum xD

I have quite a few android devices since their debut, as well as tablets and other capable devices (TV sticks, Android x86 etc.). For example: I have a Huawei Ascend XT (6"" screen) just sitting around gathering dust - I picked it up for $19 a while back on clearance at Walmart.

I did have the current base model iPad 9.7 for a min - it was on sale at a local MicroCenter for $300 (32GB version). That is a pretty good deal, and an ideal budget device - but I am relatively broke and can't really justify nice things like that. To give you an example: I pretty much have to keep my 3 pillars of tech (Phone, Computer, TV) to about $100 or less each. I am pretty thrifty/handy with stuff like this so I make it work. They are not things I directly make money from, so I can't justify any real investment. Anyhow!

There are standalone apps that have decent functionality - Audio Evolution Mobile Studio and Caustic come to mind. Samsung has ""Soundcamp"" which is kind of a joke, compared to Garageband (just a little bit of resemblance there...).

I think you can definitely get things going on android, but the environment in iOS is just more polished in my opinion. I am not the biggest fan of apple products, especially their somewhat locked down nature (mostly just file system access) - but they are somewhat more geared to media creation IMO. Garageband is typically free, and I like Yamaha Synth Book as well. If you can find a way to get the hardware for cheap, it's a nice balance - and a kind of a no fuss, ready to use situation.

I'm not a great musician - I just like to have something that is easy to get in and play around. Garageband works really well for me, and there are a pretty good amount of sounds built-in (alchemy synth). I can't really judge from a specific technical level, but I have yet to encounter something on android that really comes close - at least in regards to ease of use.

I would be more than happy to go all android, but I really don't see them catching up anytime soon. Not for the lack of trying, or potential - I just think the demand isn't so high, and Apple is kind of the go to (and they work to keep it that way).

Samsung internet offers no sync yet but is one of the best god damn browsers there is. You can have Adblock extensions in there and a secured mode that is protected by your biometrics. 

Samsung music is a great player for locally stored music. 

Use Sound Assistant to control your media volume with the volume rockers and create individual app sound scenarios. 

Give Bixby a chance!: It's great for setting up macros and to help you out if you get lost in the settings menu. For other things use the Google Assistant. And yeah, Bixby can also rap like a boss. There's also people who say that the Bixby feed is something similar to what Google now used to be. Check that out. 

Use the S-Pen features: if you want to extract texts and translate use the Bixby Vision for the extraction in the gallery and you can also use it to translate straight from the camera app. 

Check the Samsung messages app for ""Advanced messaging"", making you send texts for free to anyone with a galaxy. 

Check AdHell and disconnect pro: rootles adblock. 

SHealth is great and works more precise since it has own sensors and makes use of the sensors inside the phone. It is far more accurate and works with other accessories, such as the Mi Band.

Secured folder is an encrypted folder that let's you store stuff and apps in it and can have it's own separate apps inside of it that won't be on the main partition of the phone. Very good for better protecting your banking apps and all the ~~nudes~~ personal info. 

If you're a musician: check Soundcamp or ThumbJam. The phone has a full MIDI support for producing and creating music. An instrument tuner is also on board with Soundcamp. 

If you are a person who gets a lot of business cards in your live - check an app in the Galaxy store called ""SnapBizCard"" - scans business cards and immediately puts them to your contacts lists. 

Don't disable the Galaxy store - it updates the phones apps through it and has some other apps that will he helpful. It doesn't drain battery or RAM and won't bother you. 

Join on the live message fun. It's really cool to send animated messages. 

In general explore it and see how you can integrate the things you're given in your personal usage. It's too easy to say ""not stock"" and throw it away, but I suggest you explore and see what the things do and what they do differently and better/worse. 

I personally use Gboard and sometimes, if I want to write classically I use Samsung keyboard to write messages by hand with the handwriting recognition. 

Also don't disable the Samsung keyboard, in case you do and reset the phone you won't have a keyboard to unlock frp for instance.

Split screen: took 4 years to bring it to stock Android and everyone going mad 

Multi window: took 2 years to bring to Android being praised as picture in picture. On Samsung it works fine with YouTube too while on stock you need to pay. 

True tone display: my man u/neomancr done good work in pointing out these things. Been there since the s5, but now apple is being made the pioneer of this. 

Do not disturb game mode: OnePlus 5 has it and everyone on YouTube praises it - being there since 2015 on Galaxy devices not a single review mentioned it. 

Screen recorder - Game tools has it and now Apple's iOS 11 is being praised for it... 

Dual Pixel technology - introduced in 2016 with the s7 line up, introducing portrait selfie mode on the s8, no mention about that, but now all go wild on that portrait mode on the Pixel 2. Also everyone disregarding it as a gimmick in favor of the dual lense technology and now all praise it. 

Audio processing: Google showing off midi processing with pixel where as this was also present ever since the s6 with apps like SoundCamp. 

App power and background monitoring- being disregarded and often Disturbed with better believed things such as Greenify, while it's introduction in Oreo is perceived to be *the thing we needed*. 

Also notifications, settings menu groups and many other things have been taken from Samsung over the years, only to be summarized by the large stock cult and Mkbhd in his video ""dear samsung""

Because this year was hot as f***, he would need an RV and availability to run AC all night, away from any soundcamps. 

[keep reading if you are interested in how our preparations/set-up worked for us]
As this year was our first burn, I think myself and lilac_meddow did alright. I live and travel in my RV, and have means to live offgrid (adequate waste tanks, 2 2000w gennys, one of which kicked the dust [temporarily I hope] which meant no AC, but we were still able to run a fan inside and keep the house batteries charged). We did bring waaay too much water (not a bad thing), we drank about 18-20 gallons, had another 20+ gallons of drinking water in large containers, and obviously had the freshwater tank in the RV (50 gallons) full for things like shower, toilet, dishes. 

If you do bring an RV, keep in mind your fridge may not work very well (we used the freezer to keep things cool as the fridge ran 50-60 degrees, yes we had thermometers in each). Cold lemon water became my favorite drink of choice during the hot hours. We had mostly non-perishable foods...throw a can of soup or a packet of indian food out on the sunny playa to heat up. Lavender oil/water in a spraybottle and baby wipes kept us ""fresh"" all week.

One hack we had to make was making sure the RV didn't heat up in the morning hours so we could sleep and because once its hot, its difficult to cool down with the decreased airflow of the addition of filters on the windows and vents. I had watched a video from some other RV full-timers who have gone to Burning Man. Park north, so you can use your awning in the morning (east side) and put up a sunshade on the other/west side, diagonally and secured to the ground (we used lag screws). We weren't up early enough in the morning to put up the awning, and I was definitly not going to leave it up since its an expensive sail. We used two pop-up canopies, and attached some side-walls between the canopies and the roof of the RV, and secured it all with lag screws and ratchet straps. This set-up still didn't keep the RV from heating up to 95 each day, but it delayed it to allow for sleep. Next Burn i'm facing the RV south because the solar shades breath more than canopies.",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6yncov,,,,,,,,,,,1504823609.0,,0,,,,,,,1506583334.0,,,,,

If you're using a Samsung phone, and you play an instrument or make music, I'd suggest you download SoundCamp or ThumbJam. SoundCamp interacts with the pro audio monitor inside the phone and can be used as an audio processor. It also functions as a tuner and can record, cut and remix music using presets and samples. Essentially, a full midi deck. 

Sound Assistant can help you chose different audio presets and like rocket locker, it can let you just control the media volume with the audio buttons. 

Samsung connect is being used to interact between different Samsung devices. 

Samsung level can be used for Bluetooth audio devices from Samsung. 

Samsung flow interacts with windows 10 and can be used to open desktop or laptops. 

Samsung video editor can be used to edit videos and the extended version is on the play store too. 

SideSync let's you control your phone over WiFi from your computer and can be used to project the entire phone screen on the pc or laptop and to write messages and essentially using your phone, but with your mouse and keyboard. Also you can use your mouse and keyboard to control the phone and when you do so an arrow will appear on the phone. 

Samsung link sharing puts files on a server and shares them in a link you can control how much it lasts and the file can be max 1gb. The end results look like this:

If any of your friends are musicians show off soundcamp thumb jam and wow 2. I seriously got all my band mates to switch to galaxies from that alone. I didn't even try, I just use it and they were blown away. My drummer was an iPhone Fanboy but he's been so bored. 2 of them also switched over for the Gear vr specifically. 

The ex iPhone Fanboy used to like garage band but the USB compatibility of galaxies makes the device a lot more useful as sound equipment than what core audio offers. 

There are literally hundreds of things you can do that they couldn't even with ROM hacking. 
     

Highlights would be Knox, SAPA, s pay, the s ecosystem of any of you are privacy advocates, the display obviously and things like side sync and flow, floating window mode, the ability to run multiple instances of Android at once with zero overhead, each with their own ip address if you want with duplicate apps running simultaneously.   Enhanced messaging which is also compatible with standard RCS which allows iMessage like functionality between galaxies. Emergency power mode that hacks your battery media allowing you to continue to run your battery for about an hour after 0 percent which is great for emergencies but bad for the battery if you do it too often.   

Disconnect pro or adhell for ad blocking without having to root. And basically every thing you could do that you would otherwise have to root for like the wifi repeater mode, theming etc.     

The gear vr is a great place to start too though. It's still way better than daydream.  ",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6mdahq,,,,,,,,,,,1499681411.0,,0,,,,,,,1501114633.0,,,,,

I'm aware of the media backlash on Samsung stuff, and I'm not basing my information on that. I have an S8, and I experience it daily. Stuff that works fine on other devices need special attention on Samsung devices, especially the 4.0-6.0 versions. And since we got to support the most devices possible with minimal sacrifice (since our clients demand 100% coverage... Which is impossible, but we do our best), it is something to watch out.

Samsung's apps are NOT open source. They release the source of third party stuff they use and is necessary to release due to licensing. ""Vast majority"" - they released the source of the Samsung Browser, Soundcamp, and pretty much that's it, the rest are just the must-release stuff (e.g. Android NDK, AspectJ, etc.). Most of their APIs are hidden away with closed-to-3rd-party SDKs (try to make a custom case system using the built-in support! Or a custom app for the LED case!). As I said, they even implemented the shortcut system found in 7.1, in their own way - a small, compact menu, neat and all, but **there's no API, no developer access**. And we have 7.1 doing the same, slightly differently, in a way devs can access it. Obviously the latter is easier to work with.",,,,S8Black,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6lkn3i,,,,,,,,,S8,,1499417120.0,,0,,,,,,,1501030486.0,,,,,

Then I transferred the entire songs midi files to windows and replaced the sounds with decent ones. The results were great.

I use YouTube for music and often times I'm browsing the web and wanna watch a video. On stock it pauses the YouTube stream even if it's in the background.  Those types of restrictions are functionally annoying to me. A dropped frame here and there is not.   

Sometimes I also use YouTube as a multi track. You can upload a track onto YouTube play it then use soundcamp or any other Samsung pro audio app and layer onto it.       

But that's a moot point on stock based forks because none of them can handle pro audio processing at all.      

There is a synergy where all the enhanced capabilities open the door to a billion more usage scenarios.   Restrictions limit the versatility of your device as a tool.   

And again. Name another ROM that can do that.  Don't just presume it's possible with your imagination and expect that to be convincing. 

If another ROM was that capable way more people on galaxies would be using it.   I definitely would.

For starters, use AdHell (download it from the play store). It's an Adblock for your phone that blocks ads system wide with no root needed. 

Also, try using Samsung pay! It's a great thing if it's allowed in your country! Essentially, it emulates the magnetic stripe and lets you use any card you'd like, and it can also work on your Gear S3 watch iirc. 

Use SideSync to connect your phone to your computer and exchange files and project your phones screen to your computer. 

And last but not least, use Knox, or nowadays called Secure Folder. It is a security feature that allows you to create your own partition for your own private files that can not be accessed from anywhere. 

Use Samsung internet - way better than chrome or any other browser. 

Use SoundCamp or ThumbJam if you are a musician and would like to use your phone as an audio processor.

Use Samsung Cloud to back up your stuff. It backs up nearly anything on the phone and even backs up and restores  your home screen layout and widegets! 

SHealth is great and is now protected with knox. It does a better job than Google fit since it doesn't profit from tracking your location, but from working as your fitness Assistant.

&gt; What should I disable/delete/stop running in the background to improve battery life and overall performance? 

In my opinion, you should first see what there is on the phone and what the firmware brings. I disabled Samsung Gear (since no Gear smartwatch, although that might change after my Gear S3 arrives), SVoice (not really seeing a use in that), Facebook, Chrome, and Google Play Music. I mean, Facebook is generally known as a cancerous app together with Chrome, Snapchat and many others. I don't have a use for Google Play Music. You should not rely on 3rd party battery optimizers, since Samsung is very good taking care on it's own. I will show you some lightweight solutions to save some power. 

In Nougat, your phone gives you the option to change resolutions. In my opinion, Samsung wants us to use 1080p resolution on this phone for daily usage, and wants to keep 1440p for VR only. I use 1080p ever since I got Nougat and there is literally no difference in between the two resolutions. Try for yourself. Also, if you really want to know how much battery can be squeezed out you can use the calculations from the Power Saver (not enable it). I think it is very cool how it predicts and shows you what you can use. 

Install [AccuBattery](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digibites.accubattery). It is a great tool to track down your battery life and health and can be very useful to calculate how much capacity left the phone has. Thed developers are actually very cool and don't summon an armada of ads upon you. I donated 3$ just because I thought I give them a buck. Overall, a very good and very useful app. 

To improve battery life and have a good Facebook experience I would recommend downloading [Friendly For Facebook](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.friendly). I also use [Boost for reddit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rubenmayayo.reddit). Both have a great theme and can also be used with Amoled black, just to save you that battery. 

I know it has sync and everything, but I would highly not recommend to use Google Chrome. Use the Samsung Browser instead, it is very lightweight and is ridiculously fast and smooth. Also, it offers you to have a QR scanner and an Amazon assistant. Also, Samsung Browser has something called ""video history"", means whenever you watch a video on the web it memorizes what you have watched and will show you videos from various sites in case you wanna watch them again. 

Next I will tell you about some cool features. Above mentioned apps are just to help you with your device not being bloated and blown to bits by resource suckers. 

&gt; What cool features of the phone/downloadable apps you use? (Like the one that disables passcode when connected to certain wifi or bluetooth device) 

The Galaxy App store is there for a reason - every app downloaded there is exclusively made for Samsung devices and most of them apps there don't work with the Google Play Services framework, so they will really be lightweight and will run better. 

A few cool apps to download from the Galaxy App Store would be Disconnect Pro and AdBlock for Samsung Browser. The first one is disabling Trackers from various apps and will ""Disconnect"" you and prevent you being tracked. It also blocks ads. It has its moments where it is free, although on some Firmwares it costs 25-40$. But fear not! If Disconnect Pro costs for you, just head over to the Play Store and download [AdHell](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getadhell.androidapp). There is AdHell on the Galaxy App store, but it is not updated to work with Nougat, meh. 

I have Disconnect Pro running alongside AdHell and what I have found is that some ads are just so stubborn and will still be pushed despite Disconnect Pro. AdHell takes care of those and Disconnect pro is not active but still prevents trackers. I noticed that since talking to Neomancr and actually was too lazy to disable them. 

Once again, these AdBlocking feature DO NOT REQUIRE ROOT! Screw Adaway and destroying your phone with Root access, you have rootless DNS adblock now! 

The feature to unlock the phone is a feature from Google called Smart Lock. It only servs to collect your data and will keep the device awake all the time. Also, it is buggy so you should definitely not rely on that. 

What you should download is [Samsung Music](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sec.android.app.music). It is a great app to have because it is hardware driven and has a lot of opportunities like the UHQ upscaler and the ability to adapt sound to your needs. You will undergo a hearing test and then it will be adapted when the music plays. 

Do you play music?! Do you create music?! Definitely head over to the Galaxy App Store and download Thumb Jam or Soundcamp and make use of that SAPA feature that will give you a full midi deck. Soundcamp also has a tuner that I use for my guitar. Also it is fully iRig compatible. 

The Samsung Video creator has also a LOT of cool features that will help you edit videos and create gifs. Other redditors gave you cool suggestions so I will stop here :). 

&gt; Apps/games to pass time? 

[Here are the games I have installed](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1YJz8Jg2fyDYmxUV3liVzE5OG8/view?usp=sharing). 

Need For Speed makes use out of every last bit of the CPU on the phone and will give you PS3 like graphics on your 5.5"" screen. Outfolded, Limbo, Geometry Dash and True Skater are great games to pass time. SkyForce is a good retro shooter in OldSchool look and feel. Skydancer is a great runner with great graphics and great physics. It is definitely not like something you have ever played. Be aware though, it only works with 1080p resolution, as for now. 

ANd last but not least, it'se me, MARIO. I have fun with this game and am enjoying it so far. It's tricky enough to make me play levels again and it is designed and has a look and feel just as you would expect it from Nintendo. IF it is not available in your region, Exelero got yo cowered [and here's the apk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1YJz8Jg2fyDYnZzdHZOdm50RU0/view?usp=sharing). It is free for Android users with a few levels, but unlocking the whole game is 10$. I paid and did not regret it.

It slipped out of her tiny hands and cracked in half once hitting the floor. Bummer, right? (spoiler: no)

We didn't use the microwave a ton before the demise of the glass circle tray, but sometimes we'd still try to use it without the tray, being too cheap to pay $50 to replace and ship one.  It would heat food poorly, and it just wasn't worth it.  *So long microwave*, it was a non-memorable 7 years. 

I refused to buy one new, so I kept an eye out for microwave options whenever I went to the thrift store.  But all the options on display scared me for one reason or another. The longer we went without one, the less I missed it.  I missed it for about a year for simply heating up coffee.  But, a side benefit of that was my coffee intake decreased - not wanting to drink cold coffee, or make a new pot, or whatever. 

We heat stuff in the oven, or in a pan for leftovers.  It tastes better to us as well.  It also takes a lot more effort to make what we endearingly call ""ghetto nachos"" in the oven than to dump a bunch of chips and cheese on a plate and GN are ready to chow down in 1:31.  So, the time factor is a deterrent for otherwise unhealthy choices.  We used to make these ""brownie in a mug"" microwave desserts.

We had all sorts of unhealthy habits back then. 

Cool little insight to clock ticking, and neat to think about how it can apply across other spectrums.

I thought about upgrading to the pixel last year as well but seeing how the pixel doesnt offer half as much of my s7edge I decided to stick with my phone. 

Google will have to bring some minor things that I loved about Samsung, missed on my htc in 2015 and loved the upgrade when switched to my s7e, things like smart screen, certain gestures like the camera shortcut, hearth rate monitor and its ability to make it a shooter for the front cam, capacitive buttons (on screen navigation on an amoled is a no-go), support for things like adhell or knox, soundcamp to record my guitar and use my phone as a midi deck, the edge that I use a lot to swipe up and down, check scores, Always on Display, night clock, Samsung Pass, SHealth, Samsung Pay, which is enabled now. If you flash the BTU via Odin you will get samsung pay. Otherwise you can sideload it.

It's just so much above and beyond that if I wanted to simplify my phone experience I'd get the iPhone :-).

SAPA is outdated because latency has gotten so low, you don't need to fear the native Android stack anymore. Instead, all pro audio developers should check for the Pro Audio flag and just use the native renderer. The reason devices don't adjust gain or normalize is because they're not supposed to. It's the job of the software mixer.

For example, you can use iRig's AmpliTube on a Samsung device with SAPA or natively on devices. If your device supports the Android Pro Audio feature, you don't have to worry about anything. That means, I can use AmpliTube on my Xperia XZ and not have to worry about lag.

Some applications locked themselves in to SAPA, and are locking themselves out of low latency devices. There's no physical reason why apps like DrumJam shouldn't work on Nexus or the XZ. 

The process is INPUT =&gt; PROCESSING =&gt; OUTPUT

Processing could be anything like special effects (reverb, echo, chorus, distortion, etc) or equalizing effects (treble, bass, gain, etc). 

After the software mixer is done manipulating the input it transports it to the outputter. This is where the difference is. You have three choices. Output through SAPA (JACK), Android Audio Renderer (aka WAVE OUT aka native), OpenGL_ES (workaround for old versions of Android).

Superpowered will autodetect your device's capabilities and choose the best output device for you. That's it. The SDK has some other stuff like sampling and such which Samsung uses. My point in mentioning Soundcamp uses it is me trying to make you understand that Superpowered is not Anti-Samsung. If it was, Samsung wouldn't use it.

Of course the Nexus 9 can do dynamic gain/normalizing. It has to be done over software. I'd be really upset if I lightly tap my high hat and it sounds like a crash because of auto-gain. 

You think instruments sound tinny? That's processing.

Your audio doesn't normalize? That's processing.

Warmer sound? Processing.

Crappy instruments? Processing.

None of that has to do with the underlying connection issues.

Here's my entire point summed up. We USED TO depend on Samsung because Google was terrible. Had Google actually made a competent audio outputter, Samsung wouldn't have implemented JACK audio as an alternative. Samsung took advantage of that to make an SDK and ecosystem around it. The entire SDK/ecosystem has its uses but when talking about lag, USB audio, or MIDI, Google caught up. Other manufacturers (LG, Sony, HTC) can now be used for Pro Audio. Not just Samsung.

For example. iRig's AmpliTube can be used safely on Samsung devices  **OR** low latency devices. 

If you like Samsung's ecosystem, by all means stick with it. But there's no reason for any app to be Samsung exclusive anymore, including Drumjam. If it's not supported, complain to the dev to open it up to devices to Pro Audio devices.",,,,appdev,,,,,,,,,False,,,t3_5qmu2z,,,,,,,,,SuperOneClick,,1485736356.0,,0,,,,,,,1486544716.0,,,,,

I'd really like to know. It would be fantastic if there were apps at the same quality level as Sapa apps for native android--or even remotely close. I'd be able to use those too. 

This is the problem. If you are using a Samsung device, you are pretty much locked into SAPA apps. Using native Android audio renderer on a Samsung device will lag. It'll lag so much it's unusable for professional audio. Other devices, like Sony or Pixel don't have lag on the native audio stack. 

For example, a Galaxy Tab S 8.4 (the actual device I'm writing from) lags 15ms over SAPA. Native is 35ms

My Nexus 9 lags 16ms over native on Android 7.1.1. Lollipop apparently was ~48ms

&gt; And thanks for the correction. I forgot about the Millisecond thing.  Typically digital stop watches have a 2 digit number after the seconds digit.   I was thinking of that.     

Np

&gt; Why is audio evolution mobile, the premier daw for native android, so much more limited and unreliable than sound camp?     

Why is a first-party Samsung Soundcamp app is better than third-party? I'd guess from the resources needed to implement. TBH, no first-party manufacturer cares as much about Android audio than Samsung. Sony is probably second, but they didn't try to make a first-party app like Soundcamp. Third-party devs usually use Apple devices since the lag less and more audio enthusiasts use Apple devices. Hopefully that'll change since Google opened the market to more devices via native support and not just Samsung devices via proprietary channels.

&gt; Again all your arguments have no validity until there is actual applicability. There's a HUGE gap between the performance of sapa apps and native android /superpowered apps and you know it. That's why you're hiding behind presumptions and spurious claims from superpowered.     

Dude, what is your problem with superpowered? It's just an SDK. It wraps the JACK interface in a more flexible way than Samsung's SDK. It doesn't provide any more benefit on Samsung hardware. The point is, it'll use the fastest method for audio available based on the device you're using. Samsung? Jack interface. Android Pro Audio Support? Native. Any other device? OpenGLES.

&gt; Native android can't even handle live volume normalization for chrissake. And that's only audio play back. That's much easier than.what Sapa pro audio apps handle with ease. They can only handle pre processes files with replay gain.   And that's why video recorded even on the pixel distortions so terribly when the bass drops.     People have been o about the lack of support for dynamic gain so long now that it's not even funny anymore. Just sad.

When I say native Android, I'm talking about the default audio renderer and output. These are software features/processing that's device dependent. If you want to talk about sound quality, clipping, distortion, and the like, that's a whole different argument. For example, Sony device has a bunch of post processing options for the entire audio stack (equalizer, DSEE HX, ClearAudio+, Dynamic Normalizer, Virtual Surround Sound, etc). Still, that's system level and apps can mux/mix their outputs. The idea is the loopback be so low, you can add software effects with apps and still have reasonable lag. 

But my point is, and always has been, low latency audio was only available on Samsung via SAPA 3 years ago because Lollipop sucked. SAPA was created specifically because it sucked so much. Marshmallow and manufacturers actually caring about latency has changed that. Now, SAPA isn't needed as much anymore in terms of latency (unless you have a Samsung device since it seems Samsung doesn't care about improving native audio rendering). It also isn't needed anymore for USB audio since that's now supported natively by Android. Also MIDI is now native. Again, kudos for Samsung for not waiting for Google and being first, but Google finally caught up and brought these benefits to all devices.

If you're so interested in Pro Audio, I would strongly suggest you stop looking at Superpowered negatively and actually use that data and research to ensure you have the best setup available. They praise Samsung's for the SAPA interface and I have no idea where you got the perception they are ""Anti-Samsung"".

We moved around the dance floor a little bit, but he always stayed about 20 feet away watching us. One of my friends walked over to him and made pointedly suspicious and confrontational conversation…he didn't say much and walked away. We moved to a nearby soundcamp, and about 15 minutes later, he was back watching us…wearing a completely different outfit and fake beard. We left that sound camp to look at playa art and a sheriff SUV followed us with lights off until our group basically dispersed an hour or so later.

Another one: a couple clean-but-hippie-dressed girls strode into our camp's public space in the daytime with plastic bags and pronounced they were doing a MOOP patrol. They spent about 5 minutes picking up whatever they could find, and then asked if we would give them weed. Not sure if dumb or cop, but always treat them the same.

I've camped at a major esplanade camp the past few years, we always get people walking in, when questioned saying they're looking for ""Jason"" or ""Mary"" and mysteriously don't know the individual's last name or city of residence.  Dur. Get out.

do317 is a website that will list out all submitted events for any given day/night in Indy.  I recommend checking there first: www.do317.com

Keepin It Deep is the crew that generally throws the bigger house music events.  They generally throw their events at Blu nightclub, which has already been mentioned, but their site has quite a bit more in terms of details: http://www.keepinitdeepevents.com/

As for Techno, the scene is strong here in indy if maybe a little small.  the 317techno folks have access to the best mobile soundsystem in town in the Thumper Burning Man soundcamp.  They are super cool folks and throw an event about once a month. They don't have a website, but their facebook page is mostly up-to-date: https://www.facebook.com/317techno/

The Mousetrap is a great venue and the Thurzdaze shows that have been mentioned usually cater to a broader EDM crowd.  They mix up genres all of the time, so you might catch a night full of live jam music, dubstep, house, breaks, trap, or even drum &amp; bass.  Check them out at: www.indymojo.com

As mentioned, there's also NAP DNB (which is the group I run).  As you might expect, we're mainly a Drum &amp; Bass group and we generally throw our events at The Melody Inn on the second Tuesday of every month.  Our website is here: www.napdnb.com but most of our events and info can be found on our facebook page: www.facebook.com/napdnb

If I were to show this video to someone that didn't have any idea of what Burning Man was, I believe they would come away thinking that Burning Man is an electronic music festival.  This isn't necessarily bad, but I believe that as a community we should strive to show the other parts of the Burning Man experience.

What do I mean by this?

Well, I'd love to see a video that shows people of all ages and shapes. I'd also like to see a video that shows more people of color, and with disabilities.  It can show the soundcamps and rave experience but it should also show people sitting in the shade in camps talking.  It should show people filling up and drinking water bottles.  More time should be spent showing not only people having fun, but experience exhaustion, confusion, and even sadness and pain.  I want to see people sweating and swearing as they try and put up that shade structure.  Pictures of rebar going into the ground and blood oozing out of the hand from that fresh cut.  I want to see Rangers and LEO dealing with conflict, and maybe even someone in handcuffs.  The art should be shown in a way that emphasizes the size and interactivity.  Music that isn't electronic should be shown (and part of soundtrack) including some of the places that have live bands or even classical instruments like the person I found playing cello one year. Lastly, more shots of people hugging, sharing, gifting, and building community.

If a video existed that showed all this in a 5 minute piece, I believe that it could have a huge impact on the perception of the event and how Burning Man is more than just a rave and beautiful people having fun. Being a Burner is more than is ever shown in these slick videos and I believe that videos such as this are a disservice to our community and maintaining the ethos of the event.  I also realize that some of these things are not things that BORG would like shown, but I think that things such as LEO interactions do shape the event and are an important part of the experience.

Finally, as a Burner, I come to you not just with this criticism but as someone that is willing help to make such a video.  I believe in all the principals including some of the forgotten ones such as Civic Responsibility, Immediacy, and Self-Reliance.  So I'm offering to help make such a video happen.  Video isn't my medium as I am more of a photographer and writer, but the elements of story telling and a good visual eye are the same.  If you'd like to help me make this happen, please contact me directly.

Its really funny you say this because the reason they do it is because Borg has from day one refused any funding to soundcamps because they have always treated them as second class art installations. 

As I have said before, Borg has always hated big soundcamps and now they have the community behind them. This is just a slippery slope.

You should have no trouble finding a place for yourselves on the outer rings.

If you are going because ""hey, why not"" or because you read it in a list.  Save your time.  

Berghain is a must if you like techno, but yeah, the door can be ridiculous. People stress over it a lot. Rightfully so. The door policy is insane and runs hot &amp; cold. First time I went, a few years ago, I waited nearly three hours to see Carl Craig play Panorama Bar.  The group in front of me got negged after waiting all that time. Longest line of my life. Totally worth it.  

In case you have any doubt, yes, Sunday morning in Berghain is techno heaven.  Clubs come and go, but nothing is as unique in the club world as Sunday morning at 7 or 8 am at Berghain. The only good comparison is being at the right soundcamp at Burning Man when the sun rises (and, frankly, Burning Man has kinda jumped the shark). 

I think Berghain is worth it.  I read who is playing there just to keep fresh on who the new interesting artists are.  But, if you are not actually into being beaten into submission by a 3 hour set of 4-to-the-floor madness at the time most people are getting up and going to work and committed to staying for several hours (to days) of debauched, calculators-singing-lovesongs-to-robots music, don't bother.  It would be like going to Disney World, standing in line for hours to go on a new ride, and then having the guy at the front refuse to let you on because you don't look like you're fun enough.  If you loooooove rides, maybe it's worth that risk. But if you're like ""eh, rides are neat"" don't subject yourself to the pain in the ass of standing outside in line for 3 hours at 2 a.m. on a Sunday morning just to cross something off a list.

Pro-tip: Look a little debaucherous, look like you're up for fun, but don't be drunk, don't be overly dressed (5 chick in high heels, nah, you aint dancing), but don't be styleless (t-shirt and trainers? maybe if you have a kinda dirty hairstyle).  Most importantly, try not to have a group that is speaking all english. 2 english speaking people, long as you aren't making a scene, you're probably fine. 5 people on a stag/bachelorette weekend being lound and talking english,  chances approaching nill.  No selfies or camera use in line. Sven will notice and judge. Be low key. After all,  you're going to the most underground above ground well known famous anonymous places ever.

Bittersweet symphony playing at a 2' soundcamp and some deep house playing at a 10' soundcamp, somehow the deep beats lining up way out here in deep playa.

Then follows a deep silence, we are out here on this dead lake bed where nothing grows, the brown mountains in the distance, the heat of the sun just starting to warm the ground, the endless blue sky.

We decide on a few sub breakthrough doses. In the first I have visions of being of red and orange and yellow all dancing, electronic metal music about fire. 

The second I have a vision of fire dancing before the Man burn in a future Burning Man (I spin poi, so this may happen). I also recite a poem that I found in a porta potty the day before.

""We came to the desert,
looking for a party,
looking for an adventure.
Instead we found ourselves.
We are the party.
We are the adventure.""

Musicians are an entitled lot, and many of them are incapable of seeing the way through the current music economy in the exact same way the labels have failed. 

Statisically, throughout history, the amount of people who make music, vs the amount of people who make money off of making music has been *incredibly* slim, typically relegated almost exclusively to monolithic pop stars whose every move is calculated by a team of people who know exactly how to bilk every red cent out their adoring fans. The next tier down is a strata of pop stars who get to do what they want artistically because, for whatever fortuitous reason, the public has deemed their music worthy, and they still rake in obscene amounts of cash. Below that you have your indie mainstays who enjoy a steady stream of relative critical and monetary success, and below that a layer of hardworking bands who are essentially supporting their habit by working day jobs and running their band like a tiny little mom and pop business, and below THAT? Scads of also rans, all jockeying for position in any of the above categories, give or take the odd ""outsider musician"" or viral phenomena. 

Here's the problem: Every musician today believes the promise that we're owed a living wage for our craft. This is patently bullshit. We provide a luxury item to the public at the expense of our own time and ability. Is that, theoretically, worth money? Absolutely. However, not only is the product we sell a completely superfluous, subjective piece of ephemera that may or may not be culturally enriching, but otherwise useless; there is no possible way the average music consumer has enough disposable cash on hand to purchase the music of every bedroom Deadmaufive and garage Arcade Fire out there on a daily basis. We NEED a thinning of the herd. 

The fact of the matter is that it is highly unlikely you will ""make it"" in the music industry. That's all there is too it. The odds are stacked against you in incredible ways that the internet intensified exponentially. It is awash is mediocre to bad music. Hell, it's awash in great music that may NEVER see any kind of acclaim aside from ten people in ten obscure countries ten people have only heard of. 

If you're here to make money... I don't know what to tell you. Sit down, grab a snack, you're gonna be here a while. I'm incredibly lucky to do the things that I do with the music I create and facilitate. I mixed an album coming out on a respected indie label, both of my bands are touring the US this fall. Im peers with a few critically regarded musicians, and even still we have to WORK our fucking ASSES off to do what we do, and we lose money all the time. This tour? Im out 700 in expenses alone, and that's after I dropped 2500 on a new PA, with the agreement that my bandmate would front the 2000 in cash we need for gas. 

So no, Im not complaining about a bunch of people downloading our songs and playing them for their friends, because we're not on the radio. We're not on Time Warner. We don't have handlers or managers and assistant managers and assistants TO the assistant managers. We do this by ourselves and with the help of some very gracious people who believe in us, and we'd do it even if they weren't there because we're not entitled enough to believe that the world owes us something because we wrote some songs and spent a bunch of time figuring out how to do stuff we love, and if someone wants to make a copy of those things and listen to them that they're a thief. We're actually on the road, ""just selling merch"" and spending money on touring because absolutely no one is going to hand this shit to us. We have to build it. We have offer fans and customers more than just shitty mp3s on soundcamp and bandcloud, and likes on facegram and instabook. 


Show someone that you're worth their money, and with a little luck and ton of hard work, they'll give it to you. I don't know of *any* business on the planet where that isn't the truth.

You could find [yellow bikes](http://hammerandcyclery.com/burningmanyellowbikes.html) out on the playa. But those are temporary and will disappear the moment you walk away from them.

There are bicycle rental options out there too that will deliver bikes to the playa and you pick them up/drop them off on site.

Story:

I'm sure you've all seen those groups at night following someone with a unique looking glowy-thing on a pole up in the air?

yeah, well one of my friends did this at a regional burn with an extendable pole and a battery-powered LED xmas tree light. she got tired of carrying it around and it was handed to me. AND I LOVED IT. swooping it around, floating it over strangers and generally giving it a personality was SUPER AWESOME.. and because i ""handled"" it in a certain way.. my camp always found it easy to find me/us. 

so for BM 2012 i decided that i needed to build my own. grabbed a SUPER extendy pole and some LED lights from walmart on the way down (in i'm Vancouver), some zipties and BOOM. good to go.

the beacon (aka the pole+LED lights) extends from handy, walking staff length of ~6ft to 25ft of swingy, drift-over-strangers, stick-into-passing-windows, high-five-other-passing-beacons amazingness.

it was a great toy for me at night and all of my campmates loved it as it was so easy to find on playa, on/around art cars and in soundcamps. on burn night we left camp with 21 people and still had 16 together at sunrise. madness.
(i didn't try and ""steer the boat"" though.. just floated along with the concensus of where to go next.. following the general social inertia of the group)
