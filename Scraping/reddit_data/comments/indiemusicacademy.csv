Ever wonder who guides the careers of your favorite artists? What happens behind the curtains? Curious about the music industry? Well, Tough Love: Adventures in Artist Management dives in head first into all your questions! 

**Latest Episode: Tim Husom** (SFW)

In this episode, we shift gears a bit and explore the world of film/TV composers with my friend Tim Husom, who’s [Redbird Music](http://redbirdmusic.com/) represents some of today’s top composers, including [Dustin O’Halloran](https://dustinohalloran.com/), [Colin Stetson](https://www.colinstetson.com/) and the estate of [Johann Johansson](https://johannjohannsson.com/), to name a few.  

We discuss how his early days managing indie rock and electronic bands, married with the economic downturn of 2008, inspired him to lean into film and TV opportunities for his artists, which lead to his unique path towards redefining Red Bird as a home for orchestral, ambient and avant-garde music.  His artists have won and been nominated for Academy Awards, Golden Globe Awards, Critics Choice Awards, Emmys, BAFTAs and Grammys.

Favorite artists are Frank Ocean, The 1975, Jaden Smith, Justin Bieber, Apache, Lana Del Rey, Pink Floyd and Rauf&amp;Faik. I tend to enjoy male vocal artists more than female voices, not sure why. The female artist I do enjoy usually have deeper voices. High voices kinda make me nervous which is why I am not into some kpop and the like. 

Books: is it sad to say that I dont read books for enjoyment these days? I'm a student and have to read sm that I dont want to read more books in my free time :/ if anything I do like reading reviews, blogs and science papers online. Sometimes newspaper reports. 

games: not much, been thinking about playing chess online, not sure. I do like poker if that counts. Oh and coc, a strategic war game. 

Series: My favorite series of all time is white collar, hands down always has a place in my heart. Netflix series I did enjoy more recently are The Queens Gambit and Atypical. Also used to like Charmed and Dance Academy haha.

Movies: Breakfast at tiffanys, Goodwill hunting,some time of wedding comedy movie that I dont remember the title of, swear I like more but dont remember the title.

That's one hell of a team. I don't know if the Academy will bite because there's a good chance it'll be too offbeat for their tastes (as Larraín usually is), but at least on paper she does have a lot going for her.

Cake got bad reviews and was passed over by literally every single studio; the producers had to distribute it themselves because nobody picked up the rights even as Aniston was getting awards buzz at the fall festivals.

Lopez probably finished in 6th place, but her film was a September release (not always the best date), she got overshadowed by late-breaking contenders like Little Women's Florence Pugh, and there was probably a lot of resistance from voters who see her more as a music artist than as an actor.

And Sandler had loads of hype, but the Safdies are too abrasive and uncompromising; their films are all deliberately challenging and unpleasant. Uncut Gems is fucking amazing, but it's basically a 135-minute panic attack, so it was always going to be an uphill battle to get such a traditional group to rally behind it.

Most importantly, none of those three names had put in as much work as Stewart has to rehabilitate her image and get herself taken seriously. From 2014 on, beginning with Clouds of Sils Maria and continuing with the likes of Certain Women, Café Society and Personal Shopper, she has put in a lot of work in acclaimed indies that made a lot of people (critics, film fans, industry folks) change their minds about her. Aniston, Lopez and Sandler hadn't; they had Cake, Hustlers and Gems, but not much else in prior years to build buzz and generate good will.

Been out in BC for a long time now. I got in by doing gigs at the CFC, Craigslist, Mandy.com, LIFT, and it was on those - and they weren’t great btw - where I met other people and started doing music videos and indie MOWs. Got enough hours under my belt to join IATSE and haven’t looked back. Took about 2 years of busting my ass but there’s no direct line to instant success. 

Now the scene in Toronto is massively different than it was even 5 years ago. There are studios everywhere for Amazon, YouTube, and Netflix, plus all the others like Cinespace, Pinewood, etc. So there’s definitely more decent gigs than there used to be. 

I will warn you before you commit to school, that working in film is not easy. It’s not just a job. It’s a lifestyle. A day is 13 hours long MINIMUM 99% of the time, not counting how long it takes you to get to set and get home. Call times can start anywhere from 0530 on Monday and be 2130 by Friday. You will seldom see anyone outside of work. You will not have a sleep pattern. Sunday will be the day that you try to catch up on everything you couldn’t do throughout the week. Relationships are tough unless you’ve got a partner that gets it. When you just start out there will be times when you’re rolling in money and other times when you’ll be debating pulling people’s puds at bus stops for change.

Union gigs in Toronto are mostly series based, commercials pay the most money, and music vids suck (lousy pay, even more lousy food... you get the idea), and there’s a ton of indie shows, features, and webseries going on all the time. The indie side of the business can get really dark, really fast with no travel pay, no over time, flat rates, sketchy health &amp; safety practices, bonkers production problems,  and nepotism like you wouldn’t believe.

I moved out west because there are more features shot out here and to me, they are more personally rewarding as they feel more finite, there’s more variance in locations, more action, and you get to do some really crazy shit. Working on a series - particularly the ones in Toronto - you can start to feel like you’re losing your mind sitting on an applebox day in and day out for months on end. Titans, Umbrella Academy, American Gods... they’ve got a lot of moving parts and are way less humdrum than say, Ms. America; do something like Star Trek though, and you’re in a studio all the time. The sets are super dope at first but after a while you feel like you’re turning into Gollum being trapped in a dark cave all the time.

Most indie developers accept anything Nvidia offers them for their games on the service.
But most of them gotta go make their profits in their own service. It's gonna be the downfall of streaming services. In every market but music, companies are leaving to make their own with nowhere near enough content to sell people on the massive number of services, all wanting between $5-15 a month (depending on who the company is, what quality tier you select, and how scummy they are with things like ads)

This is why streaming services are fundamentally broken. Everyone makes their own, nobody buys streaming services. Netflix was made as a ""singular cheap option where you can find everything"" - now it's where I go to watch avatar, Lucifer, stranger things and umbrella academy, then I'm done.

Don't go around London Road area (near Sheffield United's ground) shouting to people you're a Wednesday fan, as it will attract trouble, similarly don't head to S6 (Hillsborough - Name of the ground and the surrounding area) shouting you're a Blade, you get the idea really.

People are mad passionate for football here so you do have to be careful wearing your colours on your sleeve, I mean a few years ago I remember a Wednesday player (not even fan) asked someone in a nightclub toilet on a night out if they were Wednesday or Blade and when they responded blade the player proceeded to batter him, resulting in a GBH charge, so it's really better to keep it on the down low on who you support unless you know the area's safe/you're with trustworthy people. The rivalry isn't quite Celtic vs Rangers or Man Utd vs Liverpool, but it's massive to the people of the city. 

You'll hear terms like WAWAW if you do become an Owl, which means 'We're all Wednesday aren't we?', and you'll probably call Blades pigs and they'll call you pigs too, I'm not too sure on the history of that, it just happens.

All the above is from the perspective of a Rotherham United fan (Rotherham boarders Sheffield) so I've had my fair share of stick from both fans, but mainly Wednesday fans 😂

Right, football aside we do have more things to us.

Sheffield is a massive music Hot-spot and is huge in our culture. I would say the main genre's of music that have originated here are Indie, guitar based music and Metal music. Arctic Monkeys are the biggest current band from here and every small music venue has a band playing (when gigs were a thing before covid) almost a carbon copy of AM in their first two albums phase. We've had bands such as Pulp, Reverend and the Makers, Milburn, The Human League, Heaven 17, Moloko, ABC, The Sherlocks, Little Man Tate all come from the city. On the Metal side of things we have Bring Me The Horizon who are probably the biggest heavy rock/metal band in the world from here, Def Leopard, While She Sleeps, Malevolence, Rolo Tomassi, Havelocke and a few others; Bonus entry, Yungblood is just from down the road, he's from 'Donny' (Doncaster) which is only a few miles from Sheffield but still South Yorkshire (South Yorkshire is Sheffield, Rotherham, Doncaster and Barnsley). 

Now, with such a rich history of bands coming through here it means that inevitablly our music venues are great, so when COVID eases up you'll be able to see loads of touring bands/artists at places such as The Leadmill, O2 Academy, Corporation (or 'Corp' for short), West Street Live, Bungalows &amp; Bears or even Sheffield Arena for big name touring acts. I must say, club nights at places such as Leadmill and Corp are legendary, however Corp is the same night every time you go, just don't wear white as previously mentioned as its so grimey/dirty, or some dude will spill his drink on you whilst moshing to Rage Against The Machine in the main room, furthermore I sware they put arsenic or paint thinner in their vodka as it's LETHAL, but it's a super cheap night out, and you can try doing the rainbow challenge (drink all 7 different coloured pints with triple vodka shots and mixers in) but be prepared for a rough day after 😂.

You're not the only person who is not in his twenties around here. I'm past 30 and seen not only my share of TV and movies but anime, comics, video games, and all across different mediums even if I'm not as well-acquainted with music and theatre and some other stuff as I am with anime and movies.

If you think all old TV shows avoided camera cuts and showed scenes completely as it is like they do in thetre, **than its obvious you haven't seen much old TV** nevermind that, much of television and film period.

I just watched some more Charlie's Angels and attempted to watch another Wonder Woman episode just to finally end the debate whether I should continue them or not because of upcoming lifestyle changes and the fact I am too backlogged with many shows right now including 90s, old school, and current stuff.

They use the camera cut and other modern tricks just as much in Charlie's Angels as they do today and god even in Wonder Woman which for budget reasons they tried to keep cameras at one screen they still use various editing tricks to make up for Lynda Carter's very weak acting and give the illusion she's much better than she actually is.

Not to mention the god damn terrible acting in Wonder Woman period. The only person with any skills is Lyle Waggoner and even he falls short by modern standards.

That alone shoudl prove how damn wrong your arguments in the past posts are. The simple fact Charlie's Angels relied as much on different shot angles and all the additional editing tricks so on shows the phenomenon is nothing new. New TV is not trying to use tricks at all to show how bad acting has gotten because those stricks were already being used back than and like Wonder Woman showed, at the same level if not more than modern TV.

Its really obvious **You haven't seen not only much TV but also movies as well as anime and comics and other mediums period**. Even anime despite not relying on acting uses a lot of the same angles and editing you accuse modern TV of doing to hide bad acting  so it really has nothing to do with acting skills at all in a lot of cases but using tricks to flow the story better.

Really try watching Teen Angel and try to tell me that acting today is worse than modern TV.

You really are delusional if you think Baywatch can be compared to Game of Thrones and that in a few decades people will consider Game of Thrones acting on the same level of Baywatch.  Because even in its time much of Baywatch's quality was already criticized and the same goes with its acting as a whole. minus David Hasselhoff and a few Pamela centric episodes, much of Baywatch's acting is practically on the same laughable level as the old Hardyboy's series.

Honestly if you never have seen the old Spiderman TV series ahve you? Or even much of the highest rated old stuff like Knightrider and  The Rookies? Because you'd realize we are living in the Golden Age of Live Action TV where quality is better than ever before if you actually seen Starz's Spartacus and Mad Men.

Sure some series are still great even by today's Standards such as the Shaka Zulu miniseries and some old BBC series and some performances are so electrifying they are still academy award worthy today such as North and South's magnificent casting esp in the Book 1 and you have William Shatner and a few names who make otherwise painfully outdated shows watchable because their performance are just that good far beyond their time.

But these were the minority. Event taking into account differences in type of shows like sitcoms, there is an obvious gap for example between Anson Williams on Happy Days and Jennifer Aniston on Friends or even Michael Richards in Friends. Thats just how low TV standards in general was back than minus a few exceptions that were groundbreaking back than like Twilight Zone and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Stuff like Alias blows Mission Impossible and The Six Million Dollar Man Away so much its not funny. Almost nothing back than can match the high quality of of a foreign TV show from Turkey Resurrection: Ertugrul nevermind high art stuff like The Pacific and its equally outstanding predecessor Band of Brothers. When foreign non-English modern ""brainless"" show for the ""idiotic masses"" like Resurrection: Ertugrul manages to have a far superior all round quality almost on the level of modestly budget indie films to almost everything back than including a good amount of the cream of the crop, it really shows how bad stuff was in the past.

While we are at it, lets not forget even within Britain, the most viewed stuff for decades are soap operas and even plenty of sitcom. I haven't seen much German TV but I seen enough French and Japanese as well as some Latin American programs to say that even in the international scene most TV stuff were crap. Go take a list of the longest running programs with the highest viewership and you'l not most of them are soap operas, talk shows, game shows, and sitcoms.

Even in Germany upon a quick googling already a lot of stuff I'm seeing are in the same soap and sitcom vein and even the attempts at serious stuff are mostly horrible underbudget low quality shows in everything with the notable exception of miniseries like Das Boot, a few historical themed stuff, and TV movies based on classic literature. Just like the USA and the rest of the world, I can tell from wiki and googling that much of German TV is crap and only a few examples (some which you listed in your last post) stand up to today's standards.

There's a reason why in Japan even today live action TV is seen as a joke and the Japanese import American and BBC shows as 99% of Japanese fictional shows are terrible and the most of Japanese TV is game shows, talk shows, and other nonfiction stuff (the big exception being historical period which are just as top notch stuff as what the BBC had offered for decades and equal to HBO level stuff). Only now has there been attempt to up Japanese TV standards to high class art.

Even Italy which I'm finally exploring is full of **** excepting miniseries, religious and historical genre, and a few TV movies and maybe a couple of shows. Horrible soap operas and sitcoms and shitty low quality stuff on the level to Lynda Carter's Wonder Woman fills old Italian TV through and through (and almost all of Italian fictional TV still isn't part to what the Anglo Saxon world offers though its slowly changing and things are improving)",,,,,False,False,[],True,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_lam5cn,,,False,/r/TrueFilm/comments/lam5cn/do_live_action_tv_actors_in_particular_ongoing/gm7391b/,public,False,t1_gm7391b,,,[],1612582974.0,,0,,,,,,1584046469.0,1626853227.0,,,,,

MAIN EVENT: Beyoncé’s “Black Parade” vs. Dua Lipa’s “Don’t Start Now”

DARK HORSE: Post Malone’s “Circles”

With neither the Weeknd nor Taylor Swift having made the cut in this category, the choice is between Beyoncé’s one-off slab of social consciousness and Lipa losing her consciousness about a bad romance on the dance floor. It’s easy to imagine either a Black Lives Matter-themed song by a superstar or the year’s most delectable slice of escapism prevailing in a pandemic race. By some measures, Post Malone was the year’s most popular artist, so his most accessible single across genres shouldn’t be counted out, but his tatted visage still isn’t what most Academy members like to think of as music’s face. Eilish may be viewed as someone who already having had her rewards, and likely will again when a second album appears. DaBaby and Doja Cat don’t seem quite poised to take the marquee prize. And Black Pumas, however meritorious they may be, strike most voting members as one of those recurring committee head-scratchers. The question: Since Beyoncé is double-nominated in this category — she’s also a featured guest on Megan Thee Stallion’s “Savage” — could she split her own vote and leave Lipa the spoils?

ALBUM OF THE YEAR

MAIN EVENT: Dua Lipa’s “Future Nostalgia” vs. Taylor Swift’s “Folklore”

DARK HORSE: Post Malone’s “Hollywood’s Bleeding”

However worthy you might consider them, four here can be knocked off the title card immediately, barring divine intervention: Black Pumas, Coldplay, Jacob Collier and Haim. Jhené Aiko has a shot to upset, but is likely to get her love in R&amp;B. Malone could ride his blockbuster to a Grammy, but odds are this is going to belong to a powerful woman. The fact that Lipa is triply nominated at the top doesn’t necessarily augur for a sweep: Her music is light-hearted enough that voters could feel happy giving her just one major award. That leaves the field open for Swift, whose album has the most compelling pandemic narrative. Lipa will likely prevail if voters feel that giving the album prize to a fresher face — instead of someone who’s already won it twice, as Swift has — seems like a better story for the Grammys to tell, which is highly possible. Swift-as-workhorse still feels like it’ll have more potency for voters, especially since she got snubbed on her last couple albums, and especially now that she’s just released a second acclaimed 2020 album (“Evermore”) that can’t help but influence the vote for the first.

SONG OF THE YEAR

MAIN EVENT: Beyoncé’s “Black Parade” vs. Dua Lipa’s “Don’t Start Now”

DARK HORSE: H.E.R.’s “I Can’t Breathe”

Collaborators J.P. Saxe and Julia Michaels can feel happy just to be nominated. Roddy Ricch is repped by a behemoth “Box,” but “crime drama” is not usually what the Academy looks for in this category. Voters who think Swift has the album prize in the bag may not worry so much about rewarding “Cardigan” here — unless that’s outweighed by any grievance over the song having been denied a vote in the more eminent record of the year category. Malone, again, for all his noms, seems like a slight outlier, as cred goes, while Eilish can coast on being last year’s big insider. It feels like it may be a spread-the-love kind of year, so you could envision a scenario in which voters decide to reward Lipa’s romp for record of the year and then give Beyoncé her due here for crafting a more serious song. But the wrinkle in that is the inclusion here of H.E.R., which gives voters sensitive to the BLM movement two strong picks to choose from, possibly splitting the social consciousness-favoring vote and leaving Lipa lapping the field.

NEW ARTIST

MAIN EVENT: Phoebe Bridgers vs. Megan Thee Stallion

DARK HORSE: Ingrid Andress

Chika, Noah Cyrus, D Smoke and Kaytranada have their work more than cut out for them making their music better known to mainstream voters before deadline. Doja Cat is in the running, but faces stiff competition. It looks like a race between the quiet indie-rock of Bridgers and the anything but whispery hip-hop of Megan. But keep an eye on Andress, since she is the only country candidate in any of the top four categories, and the Nashville contingent, many of them unhappy that Luke Combs and Morgan Wallen got shut out, may be looking for someone of their own to coalesce around in their feeling slighted. Then again, there’s a good chance that fans of rock and hip-hop may feel their own genres are being widely underserved in favor of pop contenders, too, and put just as much passion into electing Phoebe or a stallion in this horse race.",[],,,,False,False,[],True,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_kf8qlc,,,,/r/popheads/comments/kf8qlc/the_grammys_big_four_categories_wholl_go_the/gg6xpw5/,public,False,,,,[],1608246933.0,r/popheads,0,,,,,,1487867150.0,,False,1619251867.0,,,

""I Think We're Alone Now"" was a 1967 US hit for James and the Shondells, reaching number 1 on the WLS Silver Dollar Survey for five weeks, starting on 24 February 1967, and number 8 for the entire year 1967, and number 4 on the Hot 100 on 22 April 1967, nearly two months later, and one week to the day before Tommy's 20th birthday.

The song has been covered several times by other artists, most notably by Tiffany Darwish in 1987. The Tiffany recording reached number 1 on the charts of various countries including the US, UK, Canada, and New Zealand. 

It was re-popularized when American pop singer Tiffany covered the song when she was 15 for her eponymous debut studio album, which was released in 1987 on the MCA Records label. When George Tobin, Tiffany's manager and producer, gave her the cassette of the original version by Tommy James &amp; the Shondells, Tiffany hated the idea of recording a version of her own for her album, mostly because she thought the song was neither modern enough nor hip enough. According to Tiffany, she also did not know that the song is about the prohibition of teenage sex. The producers then remade the song as a dance track, and when Tiffany played this to her friends, they started to dance to it. Tiffany returned the next day to record the song in around four takes.

Tiffany also recorded ""I Think We're Alone Now"", but in a different arrangement, for her sixth album and her second as an indie artist, Dust Off and Dance, which became her only album in the electronica genre. It was released in 2005. For the 2007 compilation album I Think We're Alone Now: 80's Hits and More, her vocals were re-recorded, using the remixed 1987 backing track as a guide. Her earlier version is referenced in the alternative group Weezer's song ""Heart Songs"" on the band's 2008 Red Album. Weezer incorrectly referred to it as having been performed by Debbie Gibson, who performed a similar style of pop music and was popular during the same time as Tiffany. Rivers Cuomo admitted that he noticed the mistake while writing the song, but left it in the finished song.

Tiffany and Tobin made no attempt to contrast the verses and the refrain, as James and the Shondells had, instead keeping the ""peppy""[according to whom?] arrangements they used all throughout her recording and performances.

""I Think We're Alone Now"" proved to be Tiffany's biggest hit once she did record and release it. Her version of the song spent two weeks at number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart (coincidentally, another Tommy James &amp; the Shondells cover, Billy Idol's version of ""Mony Mony"", followed it on the top spot) and three weeks at number 1 on the UK Singles Chart.

""I Think We're Alone Now"" was not the first single from Tiffany's debut album. The first single was ""Danny"", but radio started picking up ""I Think We're Alone Now"", another selection on the album. It became a runaway number 1 hit and was the eighteenth highest selling single for 1987 and the thirty-second highest selling single in Australia for 1988.

The [original music video](https://youtu.be/w6Q3mHyzn78) was directed entirely by Tobin and shot in numerous shopping malls in Utah, which echoed the way her early career had been promoted. Fashion Place Mall (Murray, Utah), Crossroads Mall (Salt Lake City, Utah), 49th Street Galleria (Murray, Utah) and Ogden City Mall (Ogden, Utah). Elements of the video were filmed in the now demolished Bull Ring Centre in Birmingham, UK. The video was featured in the 2012 film Ted and the song was also on the soundtrack and appears in its sequel.

I recommend ""Beat Academy"" a youtube channel founded by illfactor (grammy-nominated producer) who has worked with Sia, Justin Timberlake etc. He works on Ableton too and his teaching videos are like top class and makes impressive utilisation out of stock plugins.

I saw you already replied to my partial reply, lol, and skimmed a bit through while helping my mum rearrange the kitchen after dinner. I guess I should reply to what's left of your previous messages first and otherwise this would get confusing, haha, so that's what I'm going to try and do.

Whenever I've introduced someone to Vetusta Morla or wanted to show them something by them perhaps they didn't know, I always go for this. Although I have to say, even if this goes off the tracks a bit since I was going to explain a bit about the performance, that another kind of reason why I haven't been listening to them as much lately (even if the main ones have to do with what I already told you) is the fact that they've got super popular over the course of the last few years, so even if it's a bit stupid to think of it like that, it's really kind of annoying seeing that people you don't really like listen to them, kind of in a pose way sometimes, or that they get a lot more media coverage, even if at the same time it's kind of cool. But, you know, even if when I discovered them they weren't a relatively unkown indie band anymore and they were starting to get recognition, it still wasn't as huge as it is now, to the point where they're still labeled as indie but their music has turned kind of mainstream in Spain.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAiz0BRTE6k&amp;ab_channel=vetustamorla

But anyways, let's get to the reason why I'm sending you this, haha. This is basically the first song off a concert where they play with my region's (Murcia) main orchestra (all of their songs rearranged in order to combine the band and the classical sound) they recorded as an album as well. I'm aware you're not able to tell what I'm doing as I write, but damn, I started playing it a couple of minutes ago and kept on typing and I'm going to stop and focus on it until it's over, as I've got major chills for like the 967854 time, haha. Damn. I may not listen to them nearly as much as I used to, but I won't ever get tired of this. They mean so much to me. And this concert's also special because of the reason why did it, which was in order to raise funds for the reconstruction of a music school that got damaged because of an earthquake in Lorca (a city about half an hour away from the one I live in), in 2011. I didn't know about them back then, and I will always be SUPER jealous of my aunt and uncle who already did and got the chance to go to one of the two shows they did for this. I'm now listening to the rest of it and LOL, I still know the speech the singer gives by heart, hahahaha. Such a fangirl. Well, I should shut up now, I won't say anything about the music and the performance itself because that's just for you to find out. I think you'll like it. I hope you love it, lol. And, of course, I'll need to hear your thoughts on it so badly, haha. 

And again, don't worry about not listening to stuff, the same happens to me all the time, and it seems to be even more intense during the last few days as there's this couple of bands I knew about but hadn't really tried getting into that I feel the urge to now, haha. I also miss most of my discover weekly and release radar, but that's just because I don't use Spotify as much as I should and when I do I just listen to my usual stuff, recs from people or just in a kind of random way. I hope you can find more time somehow for your stuff, maybe when the situation with your dad gets settled. And regarding Instagram, well, I subscribe what I said (that I'll be there), haha. Although you probably will get a bit disappointed when you actually get to check it out, since most of my gallery is from quite some time ago and there's honestly some stuff I kind of cringe at but for some reason haven't deleted, lol.

Yeah, Ew is amazing. It's actually the only one I've added to my playlist, even if I've liked some others, and I totally understand about how maybe you were a little disappointed because of those initial 3/4 songs after it, I listened to those songs by Jonah Yano (well, I realized that just a couple since I added them to the playlist where I added what you directly recommend over here and as the shuffle mode was on, it went onto other things, being the fact that I've definitely got into Spectre and Ill Wind partly because of it) you linked and they're cool! I don't have much to say about them either since I played them yesterday, but I know the one I liked the most was Goodbye blue, really cool with all the sax and the jazzy atmosphere, and yeah, the vocals remind me of Joji. There's this specific kind of sound he makes (don't really know how to describe it, lol) that's really similar. I'll be listening to them again.

And yeah, Spanish is my first language. I grew up learning English in school since I was little and well, even if I don't study it anymore (got a B2 test last year and I'd been going to lessons at a local academy for a few months, but that's it, although I'd still like to go for C1), I guess reading/writing stuff on reddit, listening to music and watching stuff undubbed as much as I can keeps it alive, haha. And well, I'll get into more detail about this you saying you don't really consider yourself smart or knowledgeable over the chat given what you told me about education during your upbringing, but I'd like to say something about it already, and it's that maybe you're not super knowledgeable, yeah, but someone who wasn't smart wouldn't have made the observations you're doing while we talk, and as harsh as it sounds, I probably wouldn't be talking to you if I didn't think you were, haha. I mean, what I find interesting about people, what makes me want to know someone and build a relationship, be it in a romantic or just friendly way, is their mind, how they think, what they think, how they express themselves, and all of that always implies some level of, call it intelligence, call it wisdom, whatever you like the most. So yeah, that's all just to say that I think you're smart, haha.

Regarding those songs by The Strokes, I'll definitely be super happy to hear what you have to say about them when you get to relisten, but there's just no obligation for you to always tell me what you think of my stuff in a detailed way just because I'm always so overexcited about getting people into my stuff and know what they think of it, hahaha. Actually, I feel kind of bad, since you've been getting into way more of my stuff compared to what I'm doing with yours, and, in adittion to that, I still ask you to tell me everything about your thoughts on things, lol. I mean, adding the lol is just for comic relief purposes, I really feel bad. You know you can always drop more recs in a random way just like I do, right? And ask me to elaborate on stuff, haha. Please, just do it as much as you feel like it, and in case you do, feel free to do it as much as me, haha.

Regarding what I said about being lonely and my friends, it isn't really important, so I'm going to try and be brief about it. It was honestly just a few days where I just didn't have anyone to talk to, send songs, or whatever. And yes, I still feel lonely every now and then and my friends are still kind of inaccesible for different reasons each one, but it's an easy come, easy go thing and I'm mostly being able to handle it well, other than those moments, specially during the weekend, where a mix of boredom and not really severe loneliness hits harder and sometimes I let myself wallow on it, so it's mostly just on me too, concerning all aspects of my life really.

Well, now onto all of that music, at long last, haha. Taro's awesome, even if I still get what you mean about the outro. That part where you say you love the music just has this kind of wolrd music vibe I think I mentioned, and it's awesome. Also, lyrics on this one are actually based on some real events involving photographer Robert Capa and his wife and it's really interesting (kind of sad too, though) to know about it, I recommend looking it up if you're curious, I'd explain it myself but I don't really remember it well and again, this would be endless, haha. Deadcrush wasn't honestly one of my favorites, but damn, I listened to it a bunch of times after having read about how you liked it that much, with my (new, got them for my birthday :)) headphones, and I agree it's awesome and much better playing loud, haha. Yeah, the different vocal styles the singer goes for are awesome too. While relistening to other stuff in order to give you more recs, I honestly didn't quite remember about/re stumbled upon super similar ones to Deadcrush, but I think perhaps this one would be kind of the closest, although maybe I'm overlooking stuff since I didn't really have to go through all of their songs I later went onto other things.

I don't know if this is the intention of the album, but I feel like this whole hugtheworlduntilicry trip is a semi-satirical take on modern drug use with all its fake consciousness-expansion pursuit. In another way, this album reminds me of the first 20 minutes of *A Requiem for a Dream*. When you're high, everything is beautiful, and, paradoxically, the only thing on your mind is death. Sonically, these tracks feel like cutting floor snippets of *Bulletin* and *Yoshimi*. Not a bad thing. Just very similar and yet not reaching the unassailable excellence of those two albums. This feels a companion piece to those, like an album with kid's gloves on. I guess several parts of this album are auto-biographical. So Coyne came of age on psychedelic drugs? Color me shocked. Shocked, I say. *Tempus fugit, memento mori*, Wayne.

[**Fleet Foxes** – *Shore*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Jrh1IRv6Pw) (USA, 2020, indie folk / chamber pop). I'm not a Fleet Foxes expert. I know literally nothing about the band's biography, not even their names or how many members there are in the band. (Checks RYM... okay they're American. That's all I know.) But just going on the songs here, Hamlet's line, ""the time is out of joint"", keeps popping into my head as I listen. An unsettled meditation on the passage of time, of beginnings and endings, and of being held in the sway of the seasons, unable to escape time's grip. Rain makes rust; nothing can stop the decay. Sunlight fades; nothing can stop the sunset. Out of joint. As in, disordered. Disordered death of all the artists who have gone to their early graves. The title itself, *Shore*, reminds me once again of death, an almost Tennysonian allusion to crossing the bar, that is, crossing over into the ocean-infinity of death.

[**Sufjan Stevens** – *The Ascension*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dYi4P0xNkE) (USA, 2020, art pop / indietronica). Comparisons to *The Age of Adz* are inevitable, though this album does not rise to the level of consistent god-glitch that *Adz* does. The paradoxical mystery of love delivering a person by forcing him into a certain path, salvation through coercion. The mystery of love escaping into itself, like the lovers in Solomon's song, going down into the villages and the orchards, escaping the terrors of the present world, horrors not limited to social media. A lot of this album sounds like private love letters. Sufjan has this unshakeable sadness that clings to him, and no matter what shreds of hope he might cling to, this black despair is ever clawing at him, threatening to tear from him those last shreds. Don't worry, though: he's got Ativan, his leading woman, to protect him! Take your anti-anxiety meds (or ""sugar""), if you need them, Soof, and know that the stars will still be there tomorrow night and for all the nights of your life. Wisdom comes in understanding that to recognize beauty is to teeter on the edge of sorrow.

**Kronos Quartet, Samuli Kosminen &amp; Kimmo Pohjonen** – *Uniko* (Finland / USA, 2011, modern classical / chamber music). All these tracks were composed by the Finnish composers but commissioned and performed in part by the American quartet. Recorded between 2007 and 2010, these pieces were originally played at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's festivals in 2004 and 2007, and after the recording at an international music festival in the Czech Republic in 2012. Interesting little sidenote: Ben Frost did the programming for these recordings. This is a beautiful blending of electronic sampling and the sounds of classical instruments such as the string ensemble and folk instruments such as the accordion. A courageous strain of melancholic energy runs through this album, vivifying what might otherwise grow cold and grey. [Sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpFNpy6vbjI).

**Wędrowiec** – *Wędrują nuk nieuzywają* (Poland, 2019, avant-folk). First off: the name of the band. It means ""wayfarer"" or ""wanderer"". Ok. This album? In the grand tradition of freaky female folk out of Poland, this offering delivers ritualistic caterwauling and clucking over a minimal tribal-drone atmosphere that evokes the elemental spaces between land and sea, between sky and earth. If you're familiar with Księżyc, then this music won't be any surprise, though it is both exciting and refreshing. After all, this album is released on the label founded by a member of Księżyc. It all makes sense, for what better wanderer is there than the moon? [Sample](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzmmq54uEM8).

[**Sun Ra and His Arkestra** – *Sleeping Beauty*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipohbylz7Z4) (USA, 1979, jazz fusion / spiritual jazz). I’m not sure how I missed this one. I guess it got lost in the very large shuffle! Anyway, this is part of my collection and should’ve been included up top. Whatevs. Here’s my reaction. This album is, of course, perfectly named, for it is the companion piece to the flip-side of a night out. This is played after the keys are tossed on the table, after the tie is loosened, after the heavy sighs and the falling into your favorite easy chair. The first track soothes and revitalizes, so when the second song comes along, you smile, realizing you've still got a bit of groove left in you. The pacing of this short album is impeccable. Close your night with this question: Does beauty exist if it is not beheld?

[**Ali Farka Touré** – *The Source*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w26iVCoINlw&amp;list=OLAK5uy_lBLU0NYUqSXleeVvHkCnTKO2Hwmi0j4iE) (Mali, 1993, Songhai music / blues). This is part of [our Africa-themed October listening project](https://discord.com/channels/601753839103639573/740351633829003377) over at the LTM discord. I'm no expert in the blues, and this is my first Songhai album, so the usual bullshitting I do when reacting to albums will probably be more evident now. What this seems to me is a meditation on blues seen through the lens of traditional Mali music. A lot of African music I've come across is repetitive (in the best sense), as it builds on a lick or a brief musical theme, expanding with joy all the permutations possible. Of course I lack the cultural and linguistic context to understand this music completely, but it feels like a meandering journey always keeping its gaze on the horizon. That is, a lot of space and openness communicated though the music. Halfway through the album, ""Hawa Dolo"" sideswipes you with heartbreaking beauty.

[**Roswell Rudd &amp; Toumani Diabaté** – *Malicool*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVMxAsyFiTY&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nhe3QEeIegiKEO8JN5iLDCcUo4zxnoHZE) (USA / Mali, 2003, Mande music / afro-jazz). This is part of [our Africa-themed October listening project](https://discord.com/channels/601753839103639573/740351633829003377) over at the LTM discord. This is an American-Malian collaboration, and it sounds like it, too, what with the rendition of a Thelonious Monk composition as well as something out of Welsh tradition (of all places!). Things never get too complicated here, which is fine by me, making for a pleasant, relaxing listen in which I can enjoy the rich tones of an expressive trombone as well as the evocative sounds of traditional Mande instruments such as the *kora* (a 21-string harp), the *balafon* (a wooden xylophone), and the *n'goni* (a small lute). They seemingly disparate atmospheres of the instruments blend well together because they never demand too much of one another.

I feel like the Brits look on it more as an art form while Americans see it as a status symbol of an industry. The majority of well-known American actors and actresses get started by being in the right place and knowing the right people, as well as being well-above average looking to appeal to the masses. Popular British actors seem to be recognized more for their talent and ability rather than their looks and connections. Also, there is a huge difference between child actors who never find another gig and adults who go into it as a career.

For instance, Benedict Cumberbatch vs. Brie Larson. Larson grew up in Cali around other aspiring actors/actresses. Her parents were both chiropractors to the stars. They were able to send her to a respectable acting school in Cali, where she gained exposure to agents and scouts and so forth. She has never appeared on stage and started as a child actor appearing on television and made-for-TV-movies. She graduated school and just kept moving up in the acting world. Cumberbatch, on the other hand, attended university and then went on to study at the oldest drama academy in England. His career began on stage, where there is no cut/take aspect - just rehearsal and go time. He started on stage and then moved up through television to indie movies to Hollywood. Both of them are in the MCU and have achieved international fame for their roles, but only one of them is widely acclaimed as talented.

I believe this comes down to a cultural difference as well as an age difference. British actors never turn up a chance to appear on stage or in productions of classics like Shakespeare (Boyd and Cumberbatch have done so both multiple times, as have Sir Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, Sean Bean, David Tennant, and many, many others.) Being chosen to perform on stage (the oldest acting setting) for one of the classics is considered a great honor. Many American actors who end up in movies shudder to think of even appearing on Broadway, let alone something as 'outdated' and, 'overdone' as Shakespeare. However, not only does a stage play require multiple rehearsals, it requires multiple performances, giving actors numerous times to give the same portrayal over and over to hone it in to perfection. And, let's be clear here: A core component of stage acting is realizing that you're not the character on stage, but rather you're playing a character. The character you are playing isn't you and won't express emotions the way you would, and you have to convey not only the full breadth of human emotion to an audience, you also have to do it pretending as if you were another person entirely. That's not often focused on in film and shows, which is why you will end up seeing American actors in the same roles doing the same things over and over again. Let's be real here: Magneto is not the same as Gandalf, and we know that just by watching them move and laugh on screen, but the same person played them both about the same time. Meanwhile, tell me what the difference is between anybody that Tom Cruise has ever played. They're all just Tom Cruise in different situations.

Then you have American child actors. America produces more child actors than any other nation, largely due to two cable networks almost exclusively dedicated to churning out child cash cows. Miley Cyrus is probably the only one that is still doing almost exactly what she did before, and most of that is owed to her dad and his connections. The vast majority of Disney/Nickelodeon child stars do not go on to have successful acting careers once they're too old for the channel. Brie Larson is one of the few, but the fact that she made it this far shines a light directly on the issue: If you've done one kind of character or one kind of role over and over for years, and never been told your Disney Channel movie schtick from five years ago wasn't that cute then and it's really annoying coming from you now at 30, why would you ever improve on it? No one in American studios wants to piss off the child stars by telling them they need to work on one thing or another. This is a HUGE part of why Miley Cryus, Demi Lovato, and Selena Gomez have great music careers and have given up on acting.  Might also be part of why we see the Harry Potter kids struggling to move on from their roles and their passable acting abilities from then to better performances now (live-action Beauty and the Beast, anyone?)

That rant there, to me at least, is why we in America don't see a spectacular lot of acting talent versus Britain producing a new Boyd, Cumberbatch, Tennant, McKellen, or Stewart every few months. We start them too young, don't give them proper coaching as they grow up, and we focus almost entirely on making gobs and gobs of money from it rather than making a moderate sum doing something exceptionally well. To that end, it doesn't surprise me, then, that we see British actors doing incredibly well in American studio productions when they've had to honestly work hard at their craft when more than half of America's current actors get their gigs, not by acting, but by reciting lines with some emotions. 

Too bad not every excellent British actor that makes it across the pond gets a great career out here. Billy Boyd, Miranda Stewart, Bernard Hill and many others have given us excellent performances without the reward of an excellent film career. To that end, I am grateful for it being on film, so I can watch it again and again, unlike, ""Captain Marvel,"" which I will never purchase.",[],,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_inb02r,,,,/r/lotrmemes/comments/inb02r/the_extras_are_really_interesting_to_watch/g4duers/,public,False,,,,[],1599517119.0,r/lotrmemes,0,,,,,,1549556775.0,,False,1611943978.0,,,

Key Club is (pre-COVID) open 4 nights a week, each night being “pop punk,” “indie,” “metal” and “a mix” themed. The atmosphere is always good there, especially on Tuesday/Saturday nights. Good place to make friends - just be wary of the dramas that go off there sometimes. 
There’s also Temple of Boom, which I think has been renamed to just Boom. The Fenton pub is a place where metalheads sometimes meet, its a good pub with a jukebox and cheap drinks. Unfortunately there has been some closures to dive bars due to covid, such as Bad Apples. 

In terms of shops, I’m not really sure. Like someone mentioned, there is a gothic shop in corn exchange. There was a hot topic, there still is - but it’s been relocated to a singular stand inside the Sports Direct lol.

A short train journey away, in Wakefield there is Morgana/Hellraiser which sells gothic clothing and jewellery (Hellbunny and brands like that) as well as hundreds of different metal band t-shirts. The owners are really nice. There’s also a dive bar called Vortex that plays metal music all night, like Key Club. 

In terms of gigs, I’d say alt bands tour there frequently and if not there, then definitely Manchester. Leeds has Leeds Academy, Arena, Student Union, The Key Club, Boom, Brudenell Social Club that all have gigs on from bands of various sizes.

Well, in addition to major festivals like Cannes, Berlin, TIFF, etc.

The arthouses have their share of ""mainstream"" arthouse like *Parasite*, an A24 title, or even a something like *Tenet* (almost always exclusively on a special format like 70mm!) but their bread and butter are the small films few hear about. They also have robust repertory programs so you can discover both old and new films alike.

Obviously, there are similar types of organizations in other countries but I'm a U.S.-based film programmer so that's where my knowledge comes from.

Striking up initial friendships with a small group of outcasts like herself, Cassie soon discovers that there is much more going on at the school and much more behind her scholarship than she had at first imagined.*

*Cassie has a whole new lease on life after being accepted into the prestigious Governor’s School for the Arts at Walnut Grove on full scholarship. At 16 years old, Cassie is just a bit older than her first year peers, and so finds herself stuck between newer students from prestigious families and the older students at the school. Striking up initial friendships with a small group of outcasts like herself, Cassie soon discovers that there is much more going on at the school and much more behind her scholarship than she had at first imagined.*

*In this third chapter, Cassie is confronted with new challenges in the early days of her new academy life but also discovers a new friend that reveals a shocking secret about the school.*

Steam charts has an all time peek of 93k concurrent users with an average of 15k concurrent users 3 years after release. Combine that with 84k overwhelmingly positive steam reviews and you've got a game that is very popular. If you're familiar with the genre then you have no doubt heard of, if not played, at least 1 game in the DOS series. 

I understand that you want more people to know the joy of this game but to say that the series isn't popular is wrong.

EDIT: This is straight from the wiki 
&gt;A month after release, the game sold over 700,000 copies, with over a million sold by November 2017. The game was nominated for ""Best Role-Playing Game"" at The Game Awards 2017, and for ""Best Narrative Design"" and ""Best Adventure/Role-Playing Game"" at the Titanium Awards; it was also nominated for ""Game of the Year"" and ""Best Story"", and was a runner-up for best PC game and best RPG at IGN's Best of 2017 Awards. The game also received a nomination for ""Best PC Game"" at Destructoid's Game of the Year Awards 2017. The staff of PC Gamer voted it as their game of the year for 2017, where it was also nominated for the ""Best Co-Op Game"" award. The staff of GameSpot voted it as their fifth best, while Eurogamer ranked it 11th on their list of the ""Top 50 Games of 2017"". Readers and staff of Game Informer gave it the ""Best PC Exclusive"", ""Best Turn-Based Combat"", and ""Best Side-Quests"" awards, and also placed it second for the ""Best Co-op Multiplayer"" award. The game was also nominated for ""Role-Playing Game of the Year"" at the D.I.C.E. Awards, for ""Game Engineering"" and ""Game, Franchise Role Playing"" at the NAVGTR Awards, and for ""Best Sound Design for an Indie Game"" and ""Best Music for an Indie Game"" at the Game Audio Network Guild Awards; and won the award for ""Multiplayer"" at the 14th British Academy Games Awards. It was also nominated for ""Music Design"" and ""Writing or Narrative Design"" at the 2018 Develop Awards. The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions were nominated for ""Best RPG"" at the 2018 Game Critics Awards, and won the award for ""Best Role-Playing Game"" at Gamescom 2018, whereas its other nomination was for ""Best Strategy Game"".

Over the course of his career, his work has often been credited for being responsible for cultural movements and musical progressions within mainstream music.\[4\]

&amp;#x200B;

Born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago, West was first known as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s, producing singles for several mainstream artists. Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, West released his debut album The College Dropout in 2004 to critical and commercial success, and founded the record label GOOD Music. He experimented with a variety of genres on subsequent acclaimed studio albums, including Late Registration (2005), Graduation (2007), and 808s &amp; Heartbreak (2008). Drawing inspiration from maximalism, West's widely acclaimed fifth album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010) ventured into symphonic and progressive rock sounds. His sixth album Yeezus (2013) was also a critical success. He went on to release The Life of Pablo (2016), Ye (2018), and Jesus Is King (2019). West's discography also includes the full-length collaborations Watch the Throne (2011) and Kids See Ghosts (2018) with Jay-Z and Kid Cudi, respectively.

&amp;#x200B;

West's outspoken views and life outside of music have received significant media attention. He has been a frequent source of controversy for his conduct at award shows, on social media, and in other public settings, as well as for his comments on the music and fashion industries, U.S. politics, and race. His Christian faith, as well as his marriage to television personality Kim Kardashian, have also been a source of media attention.\[5\]\[6\] As a fashion designer, he has collaborated with Nike, Louis Vuitton, and A.P.C. on both clothing and footwear, and have most prominently resulted in the Yeezy collaboration with Adidas beginning in 2013. He is the founder and head of the creative content company DONDA.

&amp;#x200B;

West is one of the world's best-selling music artists, with over 140 million records sold worldwide. He has won a total of 21 Grammy Awards, making him one of the Recording Academy's most awarded artists.\[7\]\[8\] Among his other awards include the Billboard Artist Achievement Award, a joint-record three Brit Awards for Best International Male Solo Artist and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award.\[9\] Three of his albums have been included on Rolling Stone's 2012 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list; the same publication named him one of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time.\[10\] West is the tied holder for the most albums (4) topping the annual Pazz &amp; Jop critic poll. Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2005 and 2015.

&amp;#x200B;

Most biographies and reference works note that West was born on June 8, 1977, in Atlanta, Georgia, although some sources give his birthplace as Douglasville, a small city west of Atlanta.\[11\]\[12\] After his parents divorced when he was three years old, he moved with his mother to Chicago, Illinois.\[13\]\[14\] His father, Ray West, is a former Black Panther and was one of the first black photojournalists at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Ray West was later a Christian counselor,\[14\] and in 2006, opened the Good Water Store and Café in Lexington Park, Maryland with startup capital from his son.\[15\]\[16\] West's mother, Dr. Donda C. (Williams) West,\[17\] was a professor of English at Clark Atlanta University, and the Chair of the English Department at Chicago State University, before retiring to serve as his manager. West was raised in a middle-class background, attending Polaris High School\[18\] in suburban Oak Lawn, Illinois, after living in Chicago.\[19\] At the age of 10, West moved with his mother to Nanjing, China, where she was teaching at Nanjing University as part of an exchange program. According to his mother, West was the only foreigner in his class, but settled in well and quickly picked up the language, although he has since forgotten most of it.\[20\] When asked about his grades in high school, West replied, ""I got A's and B's. And I'm not even frontin'.""\[21\]",[],,,,False,False,[],True,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_hum9ca,,,,/r/Harmontown/comments/hum9ca/in_what_episode_does_schrab_talk_about_kanye/fzaipdd/,public,False,,,,[],1595761866.0,r/Harmontown,0,,,,,,1509719168.0,,False,1604026462.0,,,

But here's a breakdown of what compression does:

\- Compression pushes down peaks to reduce the dynamic range. This can help to even out the performance and help the bass be heard consistently all the time.

\- Hard compression can introduce distortion to a signal. This is what people usually describe as ""color"" and is unique to each compressor design. It's most apparent with brickwall limiters: if you put a sine wave in and apply lots of limiting, a square wave is coming out. You probably know from using synths that square waves have a distorted character while sine waves are very smooth. This has to do with how a wave is converted into frequencies by the Fourier transformation (google it if you want to dive in the deep end).

\- Compression can also add groove. If you set the release time on your compressor so that it ""vibes"" with the music, you can add a lot of groove and swing to an otherwise stale performance. Try this (learned it from URM academy): take any compressor with attack and release control, then take a track (high hat loop, bass, whatever), set the attack parameter at 50 %, and the release parameter to 100 % (fastest). Set highest possible ratio and apply 10-15 dB of gain reduction (so you can really HEAR the compressor work). Then take the release and, in an interval of some seconds, flip between 100% fastest and 25% (very slow). Repeat and make notes about how the energy of the track ""feels"" when you go to 25%. Then repeat the same procedure with 100%-50% and 100%-75%. Identify which setting enhances the natural groove of your track and use this as a starting point to fine tune attack and release. Then reduce the ratio and the gain reduction to something more reasonable. If you do this every now and then with different compressor plugins, you'll quickly learn their specific compression ""fingerprint"" and you'll learn which units work on what kind of material. Being able to REALLY HEAR compression is one of the hardest things to master (still struggling myself).

Now, the ""usual"" thing for me on bass would be to use a limiter with a very fast release on the low end portion of the split bass. I'll often apply up to 10-15 dB of gain reduction to really box the bass in and make it super consistent (this is for metal productions mostly; you'll absolutely kill your jazz or indie rock track if you do this). I will usually high pass around 40-60 Hz depending on how deep the kick drum is so that they can nicely coexist. After that, any further EQ is usually done on the sum signal of the low end and high end portion of the bass (which I'll put into a summing bus). Usually there will be insane amounts of low mids around 150 to 450 that need some cutting (some of that will in fact be harmonic distortion from the limiter on the low end split signal). Sometimes there's also the occasional note that jumps out in the core bass region (around 100 Hz) that needs attenuating but this is extremely specific to the performance, the signal, the performer, the bass, the amp, ...

&gt; Janelle Monáe (born Janelle Monáe Robinson on December 1, 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, actor and performer.

&gt;  She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

*Cassie has a whole new lease on life after being accepted into the prestigious Governor’s School for the Arts at Walnut Grove on full scholarship. At 16 years old, Cassie is just a bit older than her first year peers, and so finds herself stuck between newer students from prestigious families and the older students at the school. Striking up initial friendships with a small group of outcasts like herself, Cassie soon discovers that there is much more going on at the school and much more behind her scholarship than she had at first imagined.*

*In this second chapter, Cassie learns more about the inner workings of Walgrove’s Academy, meeting her new roommate Sarah and happily confirms that she can still access her private world of dreams.*

&gt; Janelle Monáe (born Janelle Monáe Robinson on December 1, 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, actor and performer.

&gt;  She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

Anyone looking to find out which companies, brands, and content creators have betrayed the trust of the American people by aligning with groups that support the deconstruction of Western values, this list will enlighten you as to who the traitors are so you can stay informed.
[Note:] Some of the people/brands/companies on this list are not headquartered in America. However, they still cater to and influence the American (consumer) audience, and in light of their influence to help sway the views of American citizens, they have been added to the list.

&gt; Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band formed in Bolton, Greater Manchester, UK in 1976, led by singer-songwriter and guitarist Pete Shelley (1955 – 2018) for nearly their entire existence.

&gt; They are commonly regarded as an important influence on the Manchester music scene, the independent record label movement and the punk rock, power pop, pop punk and indie rock genres in general. They are primarily remembered for their singles, a string of would-be hits that combined a strong grasp of pop song craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy. These singles were collected on Singles Going Steady, described by critic Ned Raggett as a ""punk masterpiece"" The widely covered ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" remains one of their best-known songs.

&gt; The name ""Buzzcocks"" partially comes from the Manchester slang term cock meaning youngster, and its use in the 1970s ITV drama serial Rock Follies which included the catch phrases ""that's the buzz, cocks"" and ""give me a buzz, cock!""

&gt; Buzzcocks were one of the key first generation British punk rock bands to form in the wake of the Sex Pistols in 1976. They were founded by Mancunians Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto, however Devoto left soon after the group released their Spiral Scratch EP (on their own independent label), leaving Shelley to take over vocals. 

&gt; They are best known for their catchy, poppy punk sound, which has been widely influential, which was adopted as Peter Shelley took over on the vocals, singing about what the whole punk rock scene opted not to sing about: love. Devoto in the meanwhile formed Magazine.

&gt; They rehearsed in a friend's kitchen and played at the all-day 100 club punk ""festival"", in London. At the end of 1977 the band signed to United Artists and released ""Orgasm Addict"", with Shelley's high-pitched vocal delivery and Ramones-esque fuzz-guitar sound ensuring the controversial single would be played over again. Later came ""What Do I Get?"" which hit the UK charts and showed Shelley's brilliance in songwriting.

&gt; An LP was then released, Another Music in a Different Kitchen which came with its own carrier bag, labelled ""Product"". In 1978-79 five chart-hitting singles were released including ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" and had captured a pop-loving audience by this time. Love Bites, their second LP was released later on, which had less excitement than the last album, though it did sell well, with Steve Diggle taking over lyric-writing.

&gt; October 1979 saw A Different Kind of Tension which was panned by some critics, quite unfairly, as it contains some excellent songs, the title track being the stand-out. It perhaps suffered from being the second album to be released that year, with the record company keen to capitalise on the band's chart success at the time. 

&gt; 3 more singles followed in 1980, but the spark had clearly gone out for a while. Musical differences and the long slog behind them led to the band splitting in early 1981. Pete Shelley embarked in a solo career.. 

&gt; He released three dance/electronic influenced solo albums: Homosapien, XL1 and Heaven and The Sea - all with the same fine songwriting skills. Meanwhile, Steve Diggle formed Flag of Convenience - a power pop combo -  and toured with some success. 

&gt; A 5 album/CD set was released in 1989 called Product, which contained all the albums to date, plus the greatest hits and B sides album, Singles Going Steady, and the last non-album singles, Why She's A Girl From the Chainstore, Airwaves Dream and Running Free, plus the B sides

&gt; In 1992 the Buzzcocks reformed, without original drummer John Maher and bassist Steve Garvey, and releasd Trade Test Transmissions in 1993, quite different from their earlier material, with nods to the power pop scene popular at the time. All Set in 1996 saw a return to form with familiar riffs and pin sharp lyrics pop-punk. Next year Chronology was released, the missing album, including outtakes from the three United Artists albums.  In 1999 they released Modern, which saw Shelley in reflective mode and Steve Diggle taking over more of the vocal duties.

&gt; Then followed another brief break in 2000, with Shelley teaming up with old band-mate Howard Devoto to release a largely disappointing album, Buzzkunst. Compilations followed, including Inventory in 2003, which contained every single to date, and 30 in 2005 to celebrate 30 years performing

&gt; 2005 saw the Buzzcocks back touring and in 2007 they released the superb Flat Pack Philosophy, widely agreed to rank up with the best of Buzzcocks output

&gt; 2008/9 saw a short tour where the band played tracks from Another Music and Love Bites.

&gt; In August 2011 they headlined the first night of The Rhythm Festival in Bedfordshire.

&gt; In November 2011 it was announced they would be playing two shows in 2012 that would feature the original line-up as well as the classic line-up of the band reunited for the first time in many years; these shows took place on 25 May 2012 in Manchester at the O2 Apollo and on 26 May in Brixton at the O2 Academy. It was announced on 26 May 2012 that, for the first time, they would headline Thursday night in the Empress Ballroom at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool sharing the stage with the likes of Rancid, Public Image Limited and Social Distortion.

&gt; On 1 May 2014 Buzzcocks released the album The Way via PledgeMusic. On 13 September 2014 Buzzcocks played ""a brief but triumphant set"" at Riot Fest 2014 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. In October 2014 Buzzcocks toured the U.K. for three weeks with The Dollyrots as main support.

&gt; In 2016, the band embarked on their 40th-anniversary tour (dubbed ""Buzzcocks 40""). In 2017, ""Why Can't I Touch It"" was featured in the opening segment of the Telltale game 'Guardians of the Galaxy.

&gt; Buzzcocks continue to be a huge influence on many bands and are still enjoyed by a large, and very loyal, fanbase.

&gt; Pete Shelley died on 6 December 2018. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; The rap music wasn’t really that gloomy either as I specifically remember [2015-2017] being the peak of extremely cheerful, almost childlike, bubblegum trap songs (Lil Yachty, Kyle, DRAM, even Chance The Rapper to some extent).

that's completely ignoring the existence of other artists from that time who made a *way* bigger impact though and whose production definitely aligned more with dark than bubblegum. future, uzi, thugger, travis, migos, etc. 2015-2017 was *so* much more than yachty, kyle, DRAM and chance lol

also, it's not just in the sound either, trap lyrics are not necessarily what qualifies as bubblegum most of the time

&gt; There was rap with darker themes, but it wasn’t that drastically different in tone from music with similar themes that came out in 2012-2013.

rap in 2012-2013 wasn't as big as rap from 2015 onwards though. once rap became the biggest genre, it shifted the whole mood in general

&gt; emo rappers like Xxxtentacion, Lil Peep, Post Malone

grouping these artists together doesn't make sense, it's like saying ""grunge bands like weezer, nirvana, and third eye blind""

rap aside, the mid 2010s was the peak for a lot of gloomy indie music as well. fox academy, fog lake, sam ray's projects, cyberbully mom club, etc. granted these artists were never huge but music is reflective of the mood of a time period regardless, and these artists were the precursors to the (more upbeat) clairo type stuff today",[],,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_gnnp0e,,light,,/r/Zillennials/comments/gnnp0e/am_i_the_only_one_that_never_thought_of_early_gen/frccsr9/,public,False,,,2000 (Zoomer),[],1590069659.0,r/Zillennials,0,#0a67c8,,,,,1542200696.0,,False,1596165466.0,,,

La La Land and Moonlight once again head to head

Acting categories exactly as expected.

Every single time you guys disappoint me in the animation category. Kubo deserved this. Are you guys only watching the Disney movies?

The Salesman for foreign film? Really? Come on guys, that's such a bland winner. I still stand by the belief that it won as a political point against the travel ban at the time, because Toni Erdmann was the front runner for so long before and then just got fucked up by a subpar Farhadi film

Also OJ winning still eludes me to this day. It's just a solid TV show, its not even a movie. That would be like the Academy awarding Tiger King this year (Netflix could make that happen).

Bro lmao I swear how is cinematography always lining up with the actual winners. La La Land is my fave of that year and it is definitely not the deserving winner in this category. Moonlight for me here.

Oscar Winner Suicide Squad no more...

Wow finally a movie with choreography and not just cool stunts wins Best Choreo/Stunts

2017

WOW see I thought previous years were split for Best Picture but this is something else entirely. (LOL 1 vote for The Post and Darkest Hour). Get Out ultimately winning is really disappointing to me, good movie but the hype still eludes me. I like Us more weirdly enough.

And Nolan takes Best Director?? Weird call, is The Shape of Water gonna be shafted everywhere?

TIMOTHEE

Willem Dafoe is wicked close in Supporting Actor wowee

Laurie Metcalf pulling a surprise win here, I guess the Lady Bird love pulls through in the end.

Glad that The Square at least got close to A Fantastic Woman here.

NO ICARUS NO THIS BELONGS TO FACES PLACES (51% of you are so wrong now apologize to St. Agnes)

Phantom Thread best score, good call, good taste.

And Sufjan edges out Coco in a not-so-surprising win because the internet likes indie music more than Academy does.

Oh hey Andy Serkis, back again for another Apes award? Here you goooo.

&amp;#x200B;

2018

Okay The Favourite over Roma is the best thing that could possibly win over Roma but it's still DEAD WRONG.

But Bradley Cooper taking A Star is Born is something right!

I swear the Supporting ladies from The Favourite could have easily both won this award if they didn't split the fucking vote.

Okay good I was gonna start a fucking riot if If Beale Street didn't win best score

You wanna know how I know y'all didn't see Roma in Atmos? It didn't win both sound awards, that's how I know.

The Favourite winning Best Editing is excellent, but expected

\*Insert the MCJ meme about Thanos being alone and still looking huge\*

Also glad that Fallout won stunts Tom Cruise didn't jump out of a jet 100 times for nothing.

Everything is about to change.** ***New York Times*** [**https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/business/media/streaming-hollywood-revolution.html**](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/business/media/streaming-hollywood-revolution.html)

This article addresses the changes in television and film media during the late 2010s, but specifically focuses on possible changes to the structure of Hollywood. Whether it is combining award shows to focus on film *and* shows or adjusting how creators/writers are paid for streaming content. Understanding how the prominence of streaming services impacts key players in the entertainment industry (creators, writers, crews, etc.) rather than focusing primarily on consumers, will give insight to a new platform for creativity and art that may be more accessible to all artists (well-known creators *and* “indie”/first timers).

James Poniewozik, the chief television critic for the New York Times, writes about the cultural impacts of streaming service. This includes the decline of “monoculture” or “watercooler talks” because people are no longer watching the same regularly scheduled tv shows. It would be interesting to take this idea even further in order to better understand the long-term implications on our culture, specifically popular culture. What will pop culture look like or will pop culture still exist when entertainment becomes more individualistic and personalized because people are watching shows that are chosen for them?

This infographic from the Internet and Television Association gives a brief history of cable television from its start in 1948 to its widespread use and economic impact in 2017.

4. **Massad, V. (2018). Understanding the cord-cutters: An adoption/self-efficacy approach.** ***International Journal on Media Management,*** ***20***(3), 216-237.

This article focuses on consumers transition from cable to streaming services or “cord-cutting.” The author describes the move away from cable as a “power shift” and identifies/explains the reasons consumers have made this change in the way they pay for and consume media. It would be interesting to further analyze this information to better understand what went wrong with cable and based on that information then identify possible issues that may arise with streaming services and their business structure.

5. **Patchunka, C. (2019). Netflix killed the cable tv star: Cable tv is definitionally disadvantaged for use of artificial intelligence.** ***Federal Communications Law Journal,*** ***71***(2), 275.

This article describes the ways in which cable would need to change and adapt in order to compete with streaming services. Along with this overall focus of what cable can do survive, the author also goes into detail about the rising cost of cable which makes it less appealing to consumers and the competition for income from advertisements. The author also provides some insight as to what technological advances cable providers could make in order to remain relevant amongst the changing media landscape.

One of the most common complaints about cable and reasons for cord-cutting is the price. The authors of this article focus on the various pricing strategies cable companies have utilized through the years, and that in order to succeed they would need to stray from their original methods, particularly bundling, which not something they are willing to do. Understanding the pricing or bundling of cable packages is useful because along with showing the possible faults and what led to its downfall, examining this information may help predict the future of paying for streaming services as the field becomes more crowded.

7. **Prince, J., &amp; Greenstein, S. (2017). Measuring consumer preferences for video content provision via cord-cutting behavior.** ***Journal of Economics &amp; Management Strategy,*** ***26***(2), 293-317.

The authors of this article understood that the cost of cable is a primary reason for cutting the cord, but took this idea a step further by trying to analyze *who* are the cord cutters. They found that young and less wealthy individuals are more likely to end their cable plans/subscriptions. With this information streaming services are able to identify who their “easy” demographic is (in this case young and less wealthy) and other demographics they should reach out to more. This may result in the creation of new services and/content to attract and accommodate those that may be reluctant to cut the cord.

8. **Herbert, D., Lotz, A., &amp; Marshall, L. (2019). Approaching media industries comparatively: A case study of streaming.** ***International Journal of Cultural Studies,*** ***22***(3), 349-366.

This article compared various streaming platforms (film, television, and music). One of the focuses of the article is how streaming services have forced other more traditional forms of media to adapt in order to complete with streaming. The authors argue that television and music have seen the most transformation in their business models/practice, while film has largely stayed the same, but expect a rather large change in the near future.

&gt; Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band formed in Bolton, Greater Manchester, UK in 1976, led by singer-songwriter and guitarist Pete Shelley (1955 – 2018) for nearly their entire existence.

&gt; They are commonly regarded as an important influence on the Manchester music scene, the independent record label movement and the punk rock, power pop, pop punk and indie rock genres in general. They are primarily remembered for their singles, a string of would-be hits that combined a strong grasp of pop song craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy. These singles were collected on Singles Going Steady, described by critic Ned Raggett as a ""punk masterpiece"" The widely covered ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" remains one of their best-known songs.

&gt; The name ""Buzzcocks"" partially comes from the Manchester slang term cock meaning youngster, and its use in the 1970s ITV drama serial Rock Follies which included the catch phrases ""that's the buzz, cocks"" and ""give me a buzz, cock!""

&gt; Buzzcocks were one of the key first generation British punk rock bands to form in the wake of the Sex Pistols in 1976. They were founded by Mancunians Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto, however Devoto left soon after the group released their Spiral Scratch EP (on their own independent label), leaving Shelley to take over vocals. 

&gt; They are best known for their catchy, poppy punk sound, which has been widely influential, which was adopted as Peter Shelley took over on the vocals, singing about what the whole punk rock scene opted not to sing about: love. Devoto in the meanwhile formed Magazine.

&gt; They rehearsed in a friend's kitchen and played at the all-day 100 club punk ""festival"", in London. At the end of 1977 the band signed to United Artists and released ""Orgasm Addict"", with Shelley's high-pitched vocal delivery and Ramones-esque fuzz-guitar sound ensuring the controversial single would be played over again. Later came ""What Do I Get?"" which hit the UK charts and showed Shelley's brilliance in songwriting.

&gt; An LP was then released, Another Music in a Different Kitchen which came with its own carrier bag, labelled ""Product"". In 1978-79 five chart-hitting singles were released including ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" and had captured a pop-loving audience by this time. Love Bites, their second LP was released later on, which had less excitement than the last album, though it did sell well, with Steve Diggle taking over lyric-writing.

&gt; October 1979 saw A Different Kind of Tension which was panned by some critics, quite unfairly, as it contains some excellent songs, the title track being the stand-out. It perhaps suffered from being the second album to be released that year, with the record company keen to capitalise on the band's chart success at the time. 

&gt; 3 more singles followed in 1980, but the spark had clearly gone out for a while. Musical differences and the long slog behind them led to the band splitting in early 1981. Pete Shelley embarked in a solo career.. 

&gt; He released three dance/electronic influenced solo albums: Homosapien, XL1 and Heaven and The Sea - all with the same fine songwriting skills. Meanwhile, Steve Diggle formed Flag of Convenience - a power pop combo -  and toured with some success. 

&gt; A 5 album/CD set was released in 1989 called Product, which contained all the albums to date, plus the greatest hits and B sides album, Singles Going Steady, and the last non-album singles, Why She's A Girl From the Chainstore, Airwaves Dream and Running Free, plus the B sides

&gt; In 1992 the Buzzcocks reformed, without original drummer John Maher and bassist Steve Garvey, and releasd Trade Test Transmissions in 1993, quite different from their earlier material, with nods to the power pop scene popular at the time. All Set in 1996 saw a return to form with familiar riffs and pin sharp lyrics pop-punk. Next year Chronology was released, the missing album, including outtakes from the three United Artists albums.  In 1999 they released Modern, which saw Shelley in reflective mode and Steve Diggle taking over more of the vocal duties.

&gt; Then followed another brief break in 2000, with Shelley teaming up with old band-mate Howard Devoto to release a largely disappointing album, Buzzkunst. Compilations followed, including Inventory in 2003, which contained every single to date, and 30 in 2005 to celebrate 30 years performing

&gt; 2005 saw the Buzzcocks back touring and in 2007 they released the superb Flat Pack Philosophy, widely agreed to rank up with the best of Buzzcocks output

&gt; 2008/9 saw a short tour where the band played tracks from Another Music and Love Bites.

&gt; In August 2011 they headlined the first night of The Rhythm Festival in Bedfordshire.

&gt; In November 2011 it was announced they would be playing two shows in 2012 that would feature the original line-up as well as the classic line-up of the band reunited for the first time in many years; these shows took place on 25 May 2012 in Manchester at the O2 Apollo and on 26 May in Brixton at the O2 Academy. It was announced on 26 May 2012 that, for the first time, they would headline Thursday night in the Empress Ballroom at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool sharing the stage with the likes of Rancid, Public Image Limited and Social Distortion.

&gt; On 1 May 2014 Buzzcocks released the album The Way via PledgeMusic. On 13 September 2014 Buzzcocks played ""a brief but triumphant set"" at Riot Fest 2014 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. In October 2014 Buzzcocks toured the U.K. for three weeks with The Dollyrots as main support.

&gt; In 2016, the band embarked on their 40th-anniversary tour (dubbed ""Buzzcocks 40""). In 2017, ""Why Can't I Touch It"" was featured in the opening segment of the Telltale game 'Guardians of the Galaxy.

&gt; Buzzcocks continue to be a huge influence on many bands and are still enjoyed by a large, and very loyal, fanbase.

&gt; Pete Shelley died on 6 December 2018. Read more on Last.fm.

I wasn't fond of the music there either, but it was vastly superior to anything Perfect Pussy did

On Meredith Graves, I just remember when the band came out and reading the pub behind it and it really came off as sanctimonious. Seemed like this was just a phase for her so she could spin into something else, which she ultimately did in working for MTV and now she works at kickstarter as like head of music or whatever. 

Really, it came down to that fact that a lot of the push behind her and the band came down to the politics were agreeable and that seemed to inflate how people perceived the record and she lapped it up/pushed it further. I looked up an old interview from pitchfork and she talked about the band having ""feeling sessions"" or something like that. It just came off as real forced and cringe worthy to me. My feeling at the time was ""I'm sorry, I agree with what you're saying, but you also made just kind of a shitty hardcore album. Your politics aren't going to make me like it any better"". Also, Bikini Kill did what you're trying way better and with far stronger conviction in the 90s.

edit: also, just to throw in. They got the big push right around the time when there was a lot of particularly, in my opinion of course, embarrassing media coverage that thrown on bands. This was the era of the cringe inducing (""The Unbearable Whiteness of Indie"")[https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/710-the-unbearable-whiteness-of-indie/] and everyone foaming at the mouth over Frankie Cosmos and her ""DIY Ethos/realness"" when her parents are world famous, academy award winning actors.

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

&gt; Clinton Shorter is a Canadian film and television composer.

&gt; He was recently hailed by The Hollywood Reporter as one of the ""Young Composers to Watch."" His original music to the block buster, ""District 9"" is described by film critic Kirk Honeycutt as a ""magnificent score."" Shorter has worked on over 300 episodes for television, numerous commercials, indie films and original music for the Olympics.

&gt; The Award winning Vancouver native, developed a love for music at a young age. While in high school, he discovered another school that had a recording studio so he was granted a transfer and spent all his free time in the studio. Clinton entered college as a music major specializing in Jazz Studies, but left to pursue writing music with an experimental rock trio.

&gt; Clinton Shorter said his love for film music began when he heard the score to the film ""Never Cry Wolf,"" scored by Mark Isham. ""It changed my life and made me want to go down the road of film scoring."" Shorter then reentered college to study music composition and synthesis. His first break came while working at a music store when a Canadian composer came in to buy equipment. Shorter left the store to work with him and the young composer began to hone his talents. It would be several years before he would begin gaining recognition on his own, which occurred when he had a Christmas party and his sister brought a friend, Jeff Macpherson, to the event. Macpherson, a director who was in the late stages of editing his first feature film, saw all the equipment and asked him what he did. Shorter said he was a composer, which led to Macpherson hiring him to score his film called Come Together.

&gt; Shorter began scoring digital shorts for friend and director Trevor Cawood who was working at a CG facility. Cawood introduced Shorter to a young director named Neill Blomkamp. Blomkamp later hired Shorter as his composer for commercials and short films. ""Neill was only 22 at the time but everyone at the office could see his talent and felt one day he would be a super star,"" said Shorter.

&gt; One of those collaborative projects was the short film, ""Alive in Joburg"" which was the catalyst for ""District 9."" Academy Award winning director Peter Jackson saw the short and came in as the producer of the feature with Blomkamp set as director. ""When he [Blomkamp] called in late 2008 and asked me if I'd score his first feature, I was all over it,"" explained Shorter.

&gt; For ""District 9,"" Shorter worked closely with Blomkamp, ""I spent the first several weeks experimenting with every African instrument I could think of. We incorporated African male vocals with some percussion from the region combined with other elements to give the film the darkness and edge it required. I knew from the beginning that I was going to go with more of a hybrid score of live and synthesized instruments. There’s a ""mutation"" of sorts in the film and I wanted to have that mirrored in the music."" Peter Jackson referred to Shorter’s music as a ""brilliant score.""

&gt; Clinton Shorter currently resides in Vancouver and Los Angeles. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Life began for Kamasi Washington on February 18, 1981 in Los Angeles, California. In the Washington family music was more of a prerequisite than a privilege. But Kamasi never saw it that way, his love for music began at first sound. His father, Rickey Washington is a professional saxophonist by night and a high school music teacher by day. Kamasi’s mother, Valerie Washington is an accomplished flutist who fell in love with the world of science and became a high school chemistry teacher after her stint as a genetic researcher. By the age of two Kamasi had already began to play the drums and piano, the only thing that kept him away from the wind instruments at that early age was his lack of dental development. He began his exploration into the world of the reeds and brass when he was about seven and his father gave him a clarinet. By the age of twelve Kamasi had found his voice in the form of a tenor saxophone, in fact it was the same saxophone that his father played in high school. 

&gt; Over the next year Kamasi’s development and devotion to music had out grown his academic environment. So he transferred from The Los Angeles Center of Enriched Studies (one the top academic high schools in the nation) and enrolled into the Hamilton High School Music Academy. It was around this time that Kamasi also joined The Multi School Jazz Band (M.S.J.B.), an assembly of the finest young jazz musicians in Los Angeles County and led by Reginald Andrews the same man that taught Kamasi’s father in high school. Because of the sheer vastness of talent that he was surrounded by it was in The Multi School Jazz Band that Kamasi was most inspired during his high school years. Through M.S.J.B. Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi’s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as “The Young Jazz Giants”. 
This fiery group of “Young Giants” wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year “The Young Jazz Giants” had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. 

&gt; After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson’s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album “In My Time” which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi’s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called “Bird Man Records” heard him playing with “The Young Jazz Giants” and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the “big break” for “The Young Jazz Giants” but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after its completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay “ready and waiting” for too long, thus “The Young Jazz Giants” unofficially disbanded. 

&gt; Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called “The Next Step” and that’s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking. 

&gt; (2) Kamasi Washington didn't pick up a saxophone until he was 13 years old, but by that point, he'd been playing several other instruments. That's when he found his calling. Within a couple years, he was the lead tenor saxophonist at Hamilton High School Music Academy in his native Los Angeles. After graduation, he attended UCLA to study ethnomusicology. While enrolled at UCLA, he recorded a self-titled album with Young Jazz Giants, a quartet he had formed with Cameron Graves and brothers Ronald Bruner, Jr. and Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner, released in 2004. From that point, Washington continually performed and recorded with an impressive variety of major artists across several genres, including Snoop Dogg, Raphael Saadiq, Gerald Wilson, McCoy Tyner, George Duke, and PJ Morton. In 2014 alone, Washington demonstrated tremendous range with appearances on Broken Bells' After the Disco, Harvey Mason's Chameleon, Stanley Clarke's Up, and Flying Lotus' You're Dead!, among other albums that covered indie rock, contemporary and progressive jazz, and experimental electronic music. 

&gt;  The following year, Washington contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly and finally debuted as a leader with The Epic, released on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label. An expansive triple album nearly three hours in duration, it involved the other three-quarters of Young Jazz Giants -- by then part of his larger ten piece collective, altnerately known as The Next Step and West Coast Get Down-- string orchestra and choir conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. 

&gt;  The Epic was a critical and commerial success. Not only did it land at number three on the jazz charts, it also found its way on to independent albums and heatseekers charts as well. Washington and his band were not only able to tour the U.S., but to play in Europe and Japan as well. ~ Andy Kellman

If you are looking for a must play story that could get you very hooked, then I have to recommend Danganronpa's main 3 games, who are story driven visual novels, a genre of games that isn't well-know or just ignored by most people. The gameplay is mostly just clicking and reading/inspecting, and having the simplest gameplay the game needs to heavily compensate in other ways, like the story. So, if you don't mind a kind of long review, I'd like start with a synopsis of the 1st game:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Someone, the Mastermind, turns the prestigious 'Hope's Peak Academy' into a prison for the 15 protagonists. All of them ""Ultimate Students"" handpicked all over the country, prodigies that stand out above all others, each one in a different talent. Imprisoned and isolated from the outside world, they've been granted a way to escape: Anyone capable to murder another student without being discovered, may leave.  
&gt;  
&gt;Trapped in a kill-or-be-killed situation, and motivated by the numerous incentives that the Mastermind drops on them, they'll face the true meaning of despair. It will be everyone's duty to search for clues and prepare, since shortly after a body is discovered, a Trial will take place, there you'll engage in a big showdown debate.  
&gt;  
&gt;Evidence in hand, use your logic to determine the culprit, shoot your arguments to everyone in the Trial to expose their lies or contradictions, and with that, get to place them on your side. Reveal the truth and the culprit will be punished, you must do it, otherwise everyone besides the culprit will be punished, and that culprit who deceived everyone else will get to escape.  
&gt;  
&gt;But those murder cases are not the only mysteries waiting to be faced...

&amp;#x200B;

So, to give you some key tags about this saga: Murder mystery, complex/smart story and writting, lots and lots of plot twists and mysteries, character development, great soundtrack, japanese or english dub (your choice)

Pros: —The tags I just mentioned. —Nice voice acting, fitting voices. —The soundtrack performs the job admirably, from making scenes more shocking/calm, to more sad/happy/funny, to more intese/suspenseful, succeeds in building atmosphere. —The gameplay becomes more complex when you get to the Trials, it's original in some aspects, it makes you think and overall it's very interesting (btw, there're many Trials in each game and despite being long, wich is very good, they're also fast paced). —The confrontations in those Trials are in form of conversations/debates, and those have a lot of action, in my opinion that's something very difficult to achieve just with words (it makes sense though, after all they need to go with everything they got, fighting for their lives). —The amount of mysteries and plot twists, plus the writting can make you get very hooked. —It was funny how I tried to find negative Steam reviews by users back when I was trying to know better the 1st game, and I had the hardest time because it took me a lot to find one, and when I read it was something like ""This game killed my waifu"", lol. I've seen many people like me who are not into animes and visual novels recommending the game, so you don't have to believe only in my word, there are lots of reviews you can read (but watch out for spoilers, google, youtube, the wikia, and even the danganronpa subreddit are NOT your friends)

Cons: —If you don't like to read very much, you may feel some parts slow, specially in the beggining, since the game needs to introduce you to the plot, characters, and location. —Only the Trials and the most important stuff outside the Trials are fully voice acted. —Some of the mini-games in the Trials feels unnecessary (for me, at least)

Are these pros or cons? depends on you: —You can play them on PC, PS4, PSP, Vita, Mac or Linux. —2.5D anime style visuals. —Dark humor, but also normal humor. —Mature content like strong language, intense violence, blood, drug reference, partial nudity, sexual themes, rated 16 by PEGI, and 17+ by ESRB. —You'll see almost everything in terms of variety of sub-genres throughout the games, like comedy, family, fantasy, horror, music, romance, sci-fi, sport, war, besides the big ones like drama, suspense, action, crime and mystery, most of them will be used to cause a strong emotional tension to you. —And that's another part, you'll feel a lot, from some of the highest to some of the lowest feels, specially the lowest ones, this saga will do whatever it wants to your emotions in every chapter. —These games have a little bit of fantasy/unreal stuff (but most of the game, let's say more than 90% its real and logic stuff; the second game has more fantasy than the others, but still, that doesn't affect the ""real life-like"" logic of the murder cases in any game). —Most of the characters are pretty normal, but a few of them have ""anime"" kind of exaggerated personalities. —The duration of the main story in each game is: First game: 24hs, second game: 33hs, third game: 38hs. —In between the killing game plot you have the character development, you will get to know better every character, a huge deal by the time you discover their fate (and there's even some ""free time"" you can skip, but you can use it to spend time with some characters of your choice)

&amp;#x200B;

The sequels have the same -""killing game"" with Trials and students with their own different talent- basic plot, so you will get more of the same basic thing that makes Danganronpa be what it is, but with different characters and location. And they all follow a sidestory, so it's better to play them in order

&gt; Cass McCombs (born in Concord, California in 1977) is an American singer-songwriter and performer.

&gt; An enigmatic folk nomad, McCombs is a quintessentially American artist; ""he's quietly become one of (the country's) finest chroniclers of fringe characters, a writer of heart-rending love songs and psychedelic odes to the natural world, a teller of tall-tales with a sense of humor dry as desert wood, and that rare folksinger who actually sings about the folk."" His vocals range somewhere between the anxious drone of Lou Reed, the hollow croon of Elliott Smith, the lilting melody of Morrissey, and the driving earnestness and complexity of bards such as Leonard Cohen or Bob Dylan. His lyrical style is alternately vivid and weary, laconic and yearning, or drifting into the high-spirited and whimsical.

&gt; After cutting his first EP, Not the Way in San Francisco in 2001, McCombs relocated to Baltimore, MD. There he released ""Not the Way"" in 2002 and recorded his first full-length, A, in 2003 on Monitor Records. He spent the next few years touring: playing All Tomorrow's Parties; and opening for bands such as Modest Mouse, The Decemberists, and Belle and Sebastian; before recording his second LP PREfection, which was released on 4AD in 2005. 

&gt; McCombs' subsequent releases have been on the highly successful British independent label Domino Recording Co. 2007's Dropping the Writ was named one of Amazon's Best Albums of that year. Catacombs was voted one of the 50 greatest albums of 2009 by Pitchfork Media, and features Academy Award-nominated actress and singer Karen Black on the track Dreams-Come-True-Girl. During this period, McCombs toured with the likes of Arcade Fire, Andrew Bird, Band of Horses, José González, Beach House, and The Walkmen.

&gt; Catacombs also established McCombs' relationship with engineer/producer Ariel Rechtshaid, member of The Hippos and Foreign Born, who produced Grammy-winning hit Climax for Usher, the Plain White T's Grammy-nominated No.1 platinum-selling single Hey There Delilah, and albums for Vampire Weekend, Sky Ferreira, Snoop Lion, and Haim, among others.

&gt; In 2010 McCombs played Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago, L.A.'s Culture Collide Festival and Invisible Children Benefit. 2011 offered an extensive headlining tour, an appearance at SXSW, and two albums released by McCombs and produced by Rechtshaid: Wit's End in April and Humor Risk in November. The two albums were made simultaneously. In an interview with Pitchfork, McCombs explains: ""Wit's End was started years ago and it slowly made its way to the finish line. Humor Risk was just punched out. They're friends but they're different. Wit's End is like a stew; Humor Risk is the raw food diet.""

&gt; Big Wheel and Others, McCombs' seventh full-length (and first double album) was released in October 2013. The album is rooted in the Americana mythos of the Wild West, from the San Francisco drug culture to the gunslingers and gold rush of the nineteenth century. The album once again features Karen Black on a version of the track Brighter!, her final recording before passing away due to ampullary cancer in August, 2013. Big Wheel is dedicated to her memory.

&gt; Mission of Burma is an American post-punk band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1979. The band was formed by Roger Miller (guitar), Clint Conley (bass), Peter Prescott (drums) and Martin Swope (tape manipulator/sound engineer). Miller, Conley and Prescott share singing and songwriting duties. Like many of their post-punk contemporaries, Mission of Burma's efforts are largely concerned with extending punk's original vocabulary without losing its essential rebellious spirit. Using rapid shifts in dynamics, unconventional time signatures and chord progressions along with tape effects, Mission of Burma challenges the prevailing idioms of punk while attempting to retain its power and immediacy.

&gt; In early years the band's audience was limited to the Boston area, with all their recordings released on the small Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. The band released only one album in its original form, Vs.. Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope, and has since recorded two more albums, ONoffON and The Obliterati.

&gt; Their wall-of-noise musical sound extended the vocabulary of punk while continuing to hold clear its sense of power and abandon.  They used a number of tape effects, different chord progressions, and time shifts to highlight their formal training in music.  Not only that but they are seen now as a highly influential band to both post-punk and experimental music to come after; many bands cite Burma as an inspiration, including Nirvana, Superchunk, Creed, The Grifters, R.E.M. (who regularly covered ""Academy Fight Song"" on their Green tour), Sonic Youth, Throwing Muses, Yo La Tengo, Soul Asylum, Pixies, Sugar, Catherine Wheel, Guided by Voices, Graham Coxon and Moby - the last two of which have covered """"That's When I Reach For My Revolver.""

&gt; The band were due to tour in 1980 with Joy Division but the suicide of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's singer, canceled the tour. In 1983, after releasing their only full-length studio record Vs., the group disbanded due to Miller's worsening tinnitus.

&gt; The band found increasing relevance throughout the 90s, culminating in the publication of Michael Azzerad's essays Our Band Could Be Your Life which featured Mission of Burma. In 2002, they reunited and began playing reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and formerly Prescott's Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller relates that ""when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin's position, we told him he could use current digital technology which accomplishes Martin's antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted for maintaining the original integrity, and uses a tape deck.""

There are a ton of places you should upload/register your song no matter *where* you release it. A shortlist would be:

* [BMI](https://youtu.be/Bvum75E14Jk) or [ASCAP](https://youtu.be/Bvum75E14Jk)
* SoundExchange
* SongTrust (or CD Baby Pro)
* US Copyright Office

You can even upload to more places like [Allmusic.com](https://Allmusic.com) to get your song properly credited in music databases.

I also agree with the others that using a distributor like Distrokid or CD Baby would be a good move.

Here is a YouTube video explaining everything I mentioned above in regards to where you need to register your song:

The headlines are wearying, but it’s almost impossible to look away. As the coronavirus pandemic impacts more aspects of our daily lives — from sports, to entertainment, to work life and school schedules — it can start to feel like it’s all outbreak, all the time.

But there’s still a lot going on in the Chicago area, and these stories might be the nonvirus news some people need right now, from a soaring sign of spring in the city, to honoring the best chefs across Chicago.

So if you find yourself burned out by the latest coronavirus news, take a break and read about some other happenings this week.

‘The sandhills are coming!’: Big, bugling cranes returning to local skies

Winter-weary Chicagoans are once again thrilling to one of the region’s most dramatic signs of spring: the return of flocks of crimson-capped, 5-foot tall, loudly bugling sandhill cranes from as far away as Georgia and Florida.

In the past week, neighbors have been alerting neighbors, Facebook birding pages have lit up with sightings, and text alerts have ricocheted back and forth among cellphones: “The sandhills are coming! The sandhills are coming!”

Hurt instead of helped: Foster children victimized in out-of-state facilities where oversight is lacking
An 18-year-old boy, shown walking in a Chicago suburb last August, spent nearly a year at Campagna Academy in Indiana after becoming a ward of the state at age 16. ""When I first got there, I got jumped every day by kids and staff,"" he said.

The Chicago Tribune teamed up with ProPublica Illinois in an investigation that unturned repeated breakdowns in oversight of foster children sent to mental health institutions in other states.

The report details allegations of harm and sexual assault that went unanswered.

One Chicago girl who was placed at institutions in Arkansas, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee said she was sedated, subjected to bruising restraints and sexually assaulted by a facility employee, according to government records and interviews.

“I basically felt like I was abandoned, like nobody wants to deal with me,” said the girl, who is now 17.

Ohmme offers remarkable music from a Chicago band in rare form

Chicago indie-rock duo Ohmme, named for an intentional misspelling of the French word for man, is set to perform at The Hideout this weekend.

Bandmates Macie Stewart and Sima Cunningham have been gradually unveiling songs from their second album “Fantasize Your Ghost,” due out June 5.

“For this new record, we wanted to give ourselves more room to play around, so there are more vocal and guitar overdubs and strings. It sounds bigger,” Stewart said. “And it’s a lot groovier than the last one — still weird, because we can’t not be weird.”

How Chicago homeowners — and apartment dwellers — can save with solar power

This year, solar power is likely to be a popular topic of conversation in Illinois as options for renters become available and the state looks to boost its use of renewable energy over the next five years.

&gt; Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band formed in Bolton, Greater Manchester, UK in 1976, led by singer-songwriter and guitarist Pete Shelley (1955 – 2018) for nearly their entire existence.

&gt; They are commonly regarded as an important influence on the Manchester music scene, the independent record label movement and the punk rock, power pop, pop punk and indie rock genres in general. They are primarily remembered for their singles, a string of would-be hits that combined a strong grasp of pop song craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy. These singles were collected on Singles Going Steady, described by critic Ned Raggett as a ""punk masterpiece"" The widely covered ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" remains one of their best-known songs.

&gt; The name ""Buzzcocks"" partially comes from the Manchester slang term cock meaning youngster, and its use in the 1970s ITV drama serial Rock Follies which included the catch phrases ""that's the buzz, cocks"" and ""give me a buzz, cock!""

&gt; Buzzcocks were one of the key first generation British punk rock bands to form in the wake of the Sex Pistols in 1976. They were founded by Mancunians Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto, however Devoto left soon after the group released their Spiral Scratch EP (on their own independent label), leaving Shelley to take over vocals. 

&gt; They are best known for their catchy, poppy punk sound, which has been widely influential, which was adopted as Peter Shelley took over on the vocals, singing about what the whole punk rock scene opted not to sing about: love. Devoto in the meanwhile formed Magazine.

&gt; They rehearsed in a friend's kitchen and played at the all-day 100 club punk ""festival"", in London. At the end of 1977 the band signed to United Artists and released ""Orgasm Addict"", with Shelley's high-pitched vocal delivery and Ramones-esque fuzz-guitar sound ensuring the controversial single would be played over again. Later came ""What Do I Get?"" which hit the UK charts and showed Shelley's brilliance in songwriting.

&gt; An LP was then released, Another Music in a Different Kitchen which came with its own carrier bag, labelled ""Product"". In 1978-79 five chart-hitting singles were released including ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" and had captured a pop-loving audience by this time. Love Bites, their second LP was released later on, which had less excitement than the last album, though it did sell well, with Steve Diggle taking over lyric-writing.

&gt; October 1979 saw A Different Kind of Tension which was panned by some critics, quite unfairly, as it contains some excellent songs, the title track being the stand-out. It perhaps suffered from being the second album to be released that year, with the record company keen to capitalise on the band's chart success at the time. 

&gt; 3 more singles followed in 1980, but the spark had clearly gone out for a while. Musical differences and the long slog behind them led to the band splitting in early 1981. Pete Shelley embarked in a solo career.. 

&gt; He released three dance/electronic influenced solo albums: Homosapien, XL1 and Heaven and The Sea - all with the same fine songwriting skills. Meanwhile, Steve Diggle formed Flag of Convenience - a power pop combo -  and toured with some success. 

&gt; A 5 album/CD set was released in 1989 called Product, which contained all the albums to date, plus the greatest hits and B sides album, Singles Going Steady, and the last non-album singles, Why She's A Girl From the Chainstore, Airwaves Dream and Running Free, plus the B sides

&gt; In 1992 the Buzzcocks reformed, without original drummer John Maher and bassist Steve Garvey, and releasd Trade Test Transmissions in 1993, quite different from their earlier material, with nods to the power pop scene popular at the time. All Set in 1996 saw a return to form with familiar riffs and pin sharp lyrics pop-punk. Next year Chronology was released, the missing album, including outtakes from the three United Artists albums.  In 1999 they released Modern, which saw Shelley in reflective mode and Steve Diggle taking over more of the vocal duties.

&gt; Then followed another brief break in 2000, with Shelley teaming up with old band-mate Howard Devoto to release a largely disappointing album, Buzzkunst. Compilations followed, including Inventory in 2003, which contained every single to date, and 30 in 2005 to celebrate 30 years performing

&gt; 2005 saw the Buzzcocks back touring and in 2007 they released the superb Flat Pack Philosophy, widely agreed to rank up with the best of Buzzcocks output

&gt; 2008/9 saw a short tour where the band played tracks from Another Music and Love Bites.

&gt; In August 2011 they headlined the first night of The Rhythm Festival in Bedfordshire.

&gt; In November 2011 it was announced they would be playing two shows in 2012 that would feature the original line-up as well as the classic line-up of the band reunited for the first time in many years; these shows took place on 25 May 2012 in Manchester at the O2 Apollo and on 26 May in Brixton at the O2 Academy. It was announced on 26 May 2012 that, for the first time, they would headline Thursday night in the Empress Ballroom at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool sharing the stage with the likes of Rancid, Public Image Limited and Social Distortion.

&gt; On 1 May 2014 Buzzcocks released the album The Way via PledgeMusic. On 13 September 2014 Buzzcocks played ""a brief but triumphant set"" at Riot Fest 2014 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. In October 2014 Buzzcocks toured the U.K. for three weeks with The Dollyrots as main support.

&gt; In 2016, the band embarked on their 40th-anniversary tour (dubbed ""Buzzcocks 40""). In 2017, ""Why Can't I Touch It"" was featured in the opening segment of the Telltale game 'Guardians of the Galaxy.

&gt; Buzzcocks continue to be a huge influence on many bands and are still enjoyed by a large, and very loyal, fanbase.

&gt; Pete Shelley died on 6 December 2018. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

&gt; Quotes:

&gt; Wonderful and strange —- pop music from the future (John Peel – BBC – UK)

&gt; 
A gothic galactic aesthetic of ten ton beats and space age melodies. (Dazed and Confused)

&gt; Robot Koch's sensational ""Sun“, which merges Zomby's methodology with the verve of Four Tet, looks back at early '90s UK hardcore through the shattered lens of contemporary bass music to produce a track that's effervescent, dramatic and astringently sad.

What is important is that they are being taking seriously and judged along with their peers and that people are being forced to put the effort in to do so but the actual opinions don’t matter in the real world and it’s the same with food, movies and almost everything these days, you can even read the critics lamenting how their positions in society and as authorities on what is good and bad are becoming more and more irrelevant. 

Reviews aren’t personal assessments of your tastes, which i see a lot of Armeries seem to take them as either making them ashamed of liking what they like or bolstering them to make them feel like they are the truth tellers with superior taste. Don’t sweat a review that doesn’t align with your own views and don’t use one review as a confirmation bias for what is the holy grail truth...at the end of the day no one cares lol (not even the academy so much really).

* [バイリンガルニュース (Bilingual News)](https://bilingualnews.jp/podcast/) \-- they discuss various news topics while intermingling both Japanese and English conversation. They also provide transcripts via their app (some transcripts are free, but the others you have to pay/subscribe for).  (WARNING: the most recent episode is on the Corona Virus -- LOL). 

Other podcasts:

* [Let's Learn Japanese through Small Talk](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/bvamyj/we_are_the_creators_of_the_japanese_podcast_lets/) \-- probably one of the easier podcasts to listen to for beginners, as the two women will pause and explain any words they think listeners may not know.  They also post a vocabulary list on their [blog site](https://smalltalkinjapanese.hatenablog.com/) for each episode, also read the list at end of every episode. (Note, it took them a little awhile to get better at podcasting so you could skip the early episodes if you want.)
* [4989 American Life](https://www.4989americanlife.com/) \-- this was already mentioned. It's especially nice since she very recently providing transcripts.  To find the transcripts, they are kind of buried in a sub-menu under ""Podcasts"", so here's the [direct link](https://www.4989americanlife.com/blog) to the transcripts on her blog. 
* Hikibiki -- already mentioned.  I liked the Virtual Reality gaming episode, and how he had to explain what it was to his host. 
* Nihongo Con Teppei -- I haven't listened to this but it's mentioned often for beginners. 

Stuff I've been listening to is more Japanese-native oriented, but you still may enjoy it because of the topics:

* [Mark NTR](https://player.fm/series/mark-tonight-ntr-2360960) \-- this Japanese dude Mark is a huge NBA fan and he gets his friends to talk about the latest happenings in the NBA, but from a Japanese perspective. 
* [IGN Japan しゃべりすぎGamer ポッドキャスト](https://jp.ign.com/shaberisugi-gamer) \-- Video gaming news, interviews, etc. They'll cover popular video games as well as indie stuff. 
* [IGN Japan 銀幕にポップコーン](https://jp.ign.com/ginmaku-podcast) \-- Film and TV discussions. They tend to cover Hollywood movies and streaming stuff (like on Netflix, Amazon), so you'll recognize many of the shows and films they mention. They'll also occasionally talk about anime too.  Their latest episode was on the Academy Awards. 

Alternatives to Podcasts:

I pay for YouTube Premium, so I can listen to the audio-only stream of videos as I work, and because I can download them to my phone without wasting bandwidth (I loop them throughout the day).

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

&gt; Floater began in 1993 when Robert Wynia (lead vocals, bass), Peter Cornett (drums), and Dave Amador (guitar), got together in Eugene, Oregon, making their start at garage parties and the U of O beer garden. With compelling lyrics and adept storytelling, their music shifts in mood from the insistent and heavy to the melodic and soulful, comprising the signature sound for which Floater is best known.

&gt; Floater's regional success was noticed by Elemental Records, who put out their first full-length record, ""Sink"" in 1994. That same year Floater began a string of sold out shows at the Community Center for the Performing Arts (The WOW Hall) that is still unbroken to this day.

&gt; In 1995 Floater released ""Glyph"" and toured the country for the next two years supporting the record. The single, ""Danny Boy"" received heavy college and commercial radio play, in many cities outselling major label releases. Floater received nominations to the preliminary level of the Grammy's from NARAS (National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences) in 1995 under Best Rock Performance for ""Sink"" and in 1996 under Best Alternative Performance for ""Glyph."" (Prelims are determined by nominations from the NARAS members).

&gt; In 1998, following their move to Portland, Oregon (where the band currently resides), Floater released their third full-length record, ""Angels in the Flesh and Devils in the Bone."" The second concept album by the band (""Sink"" was the first), ""Angel's"" brought a new vibe to Floater. It wasn't long before widespread audiences came to embrace what has now become the band's trademark - their versatility. 

&gt; September of 2000 brought the release of Floater's fourth full- length record, ""Burning Sosobra""; a musical collection that explores the band's broad range of song writing. Following its release, the band began to perform live acoustically. Both the band and the fans enjoyed this new avenue of performance that allowed the ""quieter"" side of Floater to emerge and be explored. Of late, the band has begun playing shows where acoustic Floater opens for electric Floater - giving a sort of Jekyll and Hyde feel to their performances.

&gt; In 2002 Floater released their most critically acclaimed record to date, ""Alter."" Combining the bands strongest musical elements, ""Alter"" moves fluidly from heavy riffs to lullabies and tells flowing stories of fear, love and above all change.

&gt; August of 2004 - The release of the band's acoustic record, ""Acoustics."" Fans of Floater's electric shows responded with enthusiasm to the band's occasional acoustic performance - with their record label's encouragement, the band put together a uniquely recorded album - one that mimics the sound of their actual performances. Recorded in a studio built in the ballroom of their producers house, the record was made without digital editing and has a fresh, live feeling. 

&gt; Floater is also the name of a late nineties indiepop band from Sheffield, UK. They briefly rename themselves Floater UK before later reforming as Dangerlust. Read more on Last.fm.

I tried arknights,but that game litteraly runs out of content after 2 weeks and thats only cause its energy system is super abusive to the player.Also no premium currency for f2p players,even by gatcha standards.

I tried honkai impact 3d for half a year and ended up losing 350$.Safe to say i learned i had a problem and immedietly removed it from my life.

[Devil eater](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loadcomplete.hankanaction)  is an amazing arcade game with amazing music

[Oceanhorn](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FDGEntertainment.Oceanhorn.gp) was heart touching

[Deemo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rayark.pluto) is the only mobile game to ever make me cry and is a well made rhythm piano game with a story.

[Dead ninja mortal shadow](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microgames.deadninja) is a really hard atmospheric platformer murder fest where you move by tapping on the screen and the goal is to reach the end of any given level while not dying to the plentyfull enemies.You die in one hit but so do they so be smart.Its really fun if you want a challenge that isnt strategy based.

[If my heart had wings](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.mediac3.imh) was my first introduction to VN games and i love it.Its no masterpiece but very worth a read.Its very hearwarming.

A steam version also exsists.It lead to me eventually reading CLANNAD which enriched my life forever.(dont watch the clannad anime,its the worst trash humans ever made.Just read the novel.They changed all the bloody characters in the anime to make it a bloody harem show which it never was.Its a well written master piece that didnt get the respect that it deserved. TL;DR GO BUY CLANNAD,cry your heart out, ITS WORTH IT!)

[Ace academy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aceacademy.myapp) is another VN game like above,but this one is way stronger on the humor side of things.Pixel fade is a fun little indie studio and this game is worth a check.Also has a steam version.

[Callys caves](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vdogames.callyscaves3) 3 is a kinda fun mobile platformer. Its not too deep or anything its just dumb fun. Callys caves 4 also exsists but i like 3 more.

[The greedy cave](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avalon.cave) is a grinders paradise.Its a roguelike with a ""Made in abyss"" feel to it,before ""made in abyss"" even existed.The story is amazing,but if you are less hardcore,this game will likely make you quit when you dont realise why you cant kill the floor 40 boss.Only play if you wanna learn its mechanics and grind like a mad man. This one also allows you to abuse the cloud saves to get the best daily rewards and allows you to watch many many ads(there are no other ads) to get premium currency.You can just leave it playing those in the background to generate resources when you do something else.

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD ""Edgy In Brixton"" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London. The DVD contains a full live performance of the debut album Costello Music, B-Sides from various singles and a new song called Pretty Like a Girl.

&gt; 2007-2008: Here We Stand

&gt; On November 20, 2007, it was announced on the Fratellis' official website that work had begun on the second album in rehearsal space in Glasgow. The band stated that they are self-producing the album and have their own studio to record in. Recording finished on January 13, 2008.

&gt; On February 22, 2008, they played a small show for fans at Queen Margaret Union to debut new songs from the upcoming album. About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. The first single from the album was called ""Mistress Mabel"" and was released on May 26, 2008. The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd. The Fratellis released a deluxe edition of Here We Stand internationally on December the 8th. The CD includes a new song titled 'Moriarty's Last Stand' and the accompanying DVD includes ""The Year Of The Thief"" (A documentary of the band on the road in the US); A live show filmed on June 18th 2008 at the Fillmore, San Francisco; performances of Milk and Money, Flathead and Mistress Mabel from Abbey Road Studios and the videos for the singles Mistress Mabel and Look Out Sunshine!

The band then announced an extensive UK tour during December 2012 to take place in April 2013. During the UK tour, 3 more songs were debuted live; ""She's Not Gone Yet (But She's Leaving), Seven Days and Whiskey Saga.
On February 4th 2013, The Fratellis announced they had finished recording their third album, which was revealed to be called We Need Medicine with a release date of October 7th 2013. ""Seven Nights Seven Days"" was released as a single on September 29th. The album was recorded in Glasgow with Jon Fratelli and Stuart McCredie on production duties.

&gt; On the 24th of April 2013 it was announced that The Fratellis would be headlining Brownstock Festival in Essex on Sunday the 1st of September.

&gt; On the 22nd June 2013 The Fratellis headlined New College Commemoration Ball, a white-tie Ball set in the grounds of New College, Oxford.

Just read her wikipedia page.  Some highlights from her biography, just going from memory: she was born to a world famous psychologist and couples counselor and her hippy boyfriend.  Her parents separated because among other things, her mom said her dad started giving her LSD as a toddler, like at 4 years old.  When she was in her early teens she ran away from home and became an exotic dancer on the west coast, but she occasionally toured Japan as a sex worker/dancer (this is still her teens).  She then became part of Andy Warhol's Factory scene, and was in some Warhol movies.  Then she started hanging out with really cool underground 80s indie/riot grrl bands, and was helping to promote shows.  After one big show she promoted, where she had collected something like $20k in covers, she ran away with the money, and had previously told people, ""I'm gonna go to LA and get my nose done and be famous"", which is exactly what she did.  She moved to LA and started getting acting roles and parts in music videos.  She was starting to get press attention as a new ""it girl"" and she decided she didnt want that and just dropped everything and moved to a cabin in Alaska.  Somehow she ends up in Chicago dating Billy Corgan and then in the Pacific Northwest where shes involved in early indie projects and K Records/Beat Happening events.  Then she turned 21 and met Kurt Cobain, then she became a rock star in her own right and became an academy award nominee actress.  This about covers up to age 30, and I left a bunch of shit out.

&gt; Life began for Kamasi Washington on February 18, 1981 in Los Angeles, California. In the Washington family music was more of a prerequisite than a privilege. But Kamasi never saw it that way, his love for music began at first sound. His father, Rickey Washington is a professional saxophonist by night and a high school music teacher by day. Kamasi’s mother, Valerie Washington is an accomplished flutist who fell in love with the world of science and became a high school chemistry teacher after her stint as a genetic researcher. By the age of two Kamasi had already began to play the drums and piano, the only thing that kept him away from the wind instruments at that early age was his lack of dental development. He began his exploration into the world of the reeds and brass when he was about seven and his father gave him a clarinet. By the age of twelve Kamasi had found his voice in the form of a tenor saxophone, in fact it was the same saxophone that his father played in high school. 

&gt; Over the next year Kamasi’s development and devotion to music had out grown his academic environment. So he transferred from The Los Angeles Center of Enriched Studies (one the top academic high schools in the nation) and enrolled into the Hamilton High School Music Academy. It was around this time that Kamasi also joined The Multi School Jazz Band (M.S.J.B.), an assembly of the finest young jazz musicians in Los Angeles County and led by Reginald Andrews the same man that taught Kamasi’s father in high school. Because of the sheer vastness of talent that he was surrounded by it was in The Multi School Jazz Band that Kamasi was most inspired during his high school years. Through M.S.J.B. Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi’s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as “The Young Jazz Giants”. 
This fiery group of “Young Giants” wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year “The Young Jazz Giants” had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. 

&gt; After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson’s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album “In My Time” which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi’s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called “Bird Man Records” heard him playing with “The Young Jazz Giants” and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the “big break” for “The Young Jazz Giants” but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after its completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay “ready and waiting” for too long, thus “The Young Jazz Giants” unofficially disbanded. 

&gt; Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called “The Next Step” and that’s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking. 

&gt; (2) Kamasi Washington didn't pick up a saxophone until he was 13 years old, but by that point, he'd been playing several other instruments. That's when he found his calling. Within a couple years, he was the lead tenor saxophonist at Hamilton High School Music Academy in his native Los Angeles. After graduation, he attended UCLA to study ethnomusicology. While enrolled at UCLA, he recorded a self-titled album with Young Jazz Giants, a quartet he had formed with Cameron Graves and brothers Ronald Bruner, Jr. and Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner, released in 2004. From that point, Washington continually performed and recorded with an impressive variety of major artists across several genres, including Snoop Dogg, Raphael Saadiq, Gerald Wilson, McCoy Tyner, George Duke, and PJ Morton. In 2014 alone, Washington demonstrated tremendous range with appearances on Broken Bells' After the Disco, Harvey Mason's Chameleon, Stanley Clarke's Up, and Flying Lotus' You're Dead!, among other albums that covered indie rock, contemporary and progressive jazz, and experimental electronic music. 

&gt;  The following year, Washington contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly and finally debuted as a leader with The Epic, released on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label. An expansive triple album nearly three hours in duration, it involved the other three-quarters of Young Jazz Giants -- by then part of his larger ten piece collective, altnerately known as The Next Step and West Coast Get Down-- string orchestra and choir conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. 

&gt;  The Epic was a critical and commerial success. Not only did it land at number three on the jazz charts, it also found its way on to independent albums and heatseekers charts as well. Washington and his band were not only able to tour the U.S., but to play in Europe and Japan as well. ~ Andy Kellman

&gt; Janelle Monáe (born Janelle Monáe Robinson on December 1, 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and performer.

&gt;  She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

&gt; Mission of Burma is an American post-punk band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1979. The band was formed by Roger Miller (guitar), Clint Conley (bass), Peter Prescott (drums) and Martin Swope (tape manipulator/sound engineer). Miller, Conley and Prescott share singing and songwriting duties. Like many of their post-punk contemporaries, Mission of Burma's efforts are largely concerned with extending punk's original vocabulary without losing its essential rebellious spirit. Using rapid shifts in dynamics, unconventional time signatures and chord progressions along with tape effects, Mission of Burma challenges the prevailing idioms of punk while attempting to retain its power and immediacy.

&gt; In early years the band's audience was limited to the Boston area, with all their recordings released on the small Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. The band released only one album in its original form, Vs.. Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope, and has since recorded two more albums, ONoffON and The Obliterati.

&gt; Their wall-of-noise musical sound extended the vocabulary of punk while continuing to hold clear its sense of power and abandon.  They used a number of tape effects, different chord progressions, and time shifts to highlight their formal training in music.  Not only that but they are seen now as a highly influential band to both post-punk and experimental music to come after; many bands cite Burma as an inspiration, including Nirvana, Superchunk, Creed, The Grifters, R.E.M. (who regularly covered ""Academy Fight Song"" on their Green tour), Sonic Youth, Throwing Muses, Yo La Tengo, Soul Asylum, Pixies, Sugar, Catherine Wheel, Guided by Voices, Graham Coxon and Moby - the last two of which have covered """"That's When I Reach For My Revolver.""

&gt; The band were due to tour in 1980 with Joy Division but the suicide of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's singer, canceled the tour. In 1983, after releasing their only full-length studio record Vs., the group disbanded due to Miller's worsening tinnitus.

&gt; The band found increasing relevance throughout the 90s, culminating in the publication of Michael Azzerad's essays Our Band Could Be Your Life which featured Mission of Burma. In 2002, they reunited and began playing reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and formerly Prescott's Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller relates that ""when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin's position, we told him he could use current digital technology which accomplishes Martin's antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted for maintaining the original integrity, and uses a tape deck.""

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD ""Edgy In Brixton"" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London. The DVD contains a full live performance of the debut album Costello Music, B-Sides from various singles and a new song called Pretty Like a Girl. Extras on the DVD include the band being asked questions by members of The Fratellis' website, and on the deluxe edition, highlights from the T In The Park 2007 festival. It was released in the United States on the 30 October 2007

&gt; 2007-2008: Here We Stand

&gt; On November 20, 2007, it was announced on the Fratellis' official website that work had begun on the second album in rehearsal space in Glasgow. The band stated that they are self-producing the album and have their own studio to record in. Recording finished on January 13, 2008.

&gt; On February 22, 2008, they played a small show for fans at Queen Margaret Union to debut new songs from the upcoming album. About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. The first single from the album was called ""Mistress Mabel"" and was released on May 26, 2008. The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd. The Fratellis released a deluxe edition of Here We Stand internationally on December the 8th. The CD includes a new song titled 'Moriarty's Last Stand' and the accompanying DVD includes ""The Year Of The Thief"" (A documentary of the band on the road in the US); A live show filmed on June 18th 2008 at the Fillmore, San Francisco; performances of Milk and Money, Flathead and Mistress Mabel from Abbey Road Studios and the videos for the singles Mistress Mabel and Look Out Sunshine!

&gt; Sin Fang is the stage name of Sindri Már Sigfússon, an Icelandic musician and member of the band Seabear.

&gt; It was in 2011 that Iceland's king of lo-fi layered lushness, Sindri Már Sigfússon released “Summer Echoes” as an album under the name of his solo-project Sin Fang (he had previously recorded as Sin Fang Bous). The album oscillated wildly unearthing glimpses of familiarity - vintage Flying Nun here, Paw Tracks there and a Belle and Sebastian pop nous - while retaining the own stark originality of this uber-talented artist and producer. 

&gt; And Sigfússon is a pretty unlikely ambassador of the Icelandic indie pop scene: in his teens he was a skateboard and Hip Hop aficionado, his arms are covered with a colourful mess of self designed tattoos and besides doing visual arts his true favourite obsessions are soccer and pizza: what makes him pretty much an antidote to the all too present cliché of the Icelandic nature boy. Sigfússon didn’t pick up a guitar until he was 20 but after graduating from art academy and moving to London he became sick and bought his first proper home recording equipment from the insurance money he got. And within just a few years, his infamous work ethic (he has a very strict 9 to 5 routine working on songs in his basement studio) and distinctive do-it-yourself production style culminated in the Sin Fang (Bous) debut album “Clangour” which was released on Morr Music in 2009 to worldwide acclaim and suddenly propelled him in the midst of a new wave of bands redefining the indie rock game in thus far unexpected directions. 

&gt; Enthusiastic media and blog coverage and live shows in Europe, North America and Brazil followed. 

&gt; After having set himself the task of playing all instruments on his debut solo album ""Clangour"", this time around Sigfússon wanted to move closer to the sound of a live band and recruited a number of his friends from múm, Amiina and Seabear to record “Summer Echoes” in his own studio and Sigur Rós Sundlaugin studio. The arrangements are more band oriented, grander in scope and more transparent than their predecessor’s and there is a diverse breadth of sounds across ""Summer Echoes"" dozen songs, reaching from a heart-breaking intimate piano ballad like “Two Boys” to sudden outbursts of guitar noise in “Bruises”. Not even the one-off appearance of synthetic beats in ""Sing For A Dream"" sound out of place when drenched in Sin Fang's signature layered wash of sound and it is the album's first single, ""Because Of The Blood"" that encapsulates the essence of this album in an euphoric orchestral pop song that manages to merge epic tune sculpting with several layers of choir abundance. 

&gt; The fact that Sigfússon did not only write all the music but also was doing most of the recording and production promises a lot for his future and “Summer Echoes” conveys the feeling that the real story has only just begun: and in fact a next Sin Fang album is already fully written and Sigfússon shows no willingness to slow down. Summer Echoes will be released on Morr Music in March 2011. A limited edition Sin Fang 7"" featuring the non-album coverversions of Fleetwood Mac's ""Landslide"" and Simon &amp; Garfunkel's ""The Only Living Boy In New York"" is available as of December 2010 while the album's first single, ""Because Of The Blood/Two Boys"" will be out in February 2011. The artwork for the release was done together with Sigfússons partner Inga Birgisdóttir.

&gt; 2016 saw the release of Spaceland and, with it, Sin Fang's total conversion to electronic music.  Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; British-born Carina Round is a singer-songwriter whom has earned tremendous accolades from fans, critics and the artistic community alike for both her distinctive, yet versatile vocal style and gut wrenchingly honest songwriting.

&gt; Her critically acclaimed performances are nothing short of spectacular. She runs the gamut from “howling siren” to the performer of ethereal confessional tales, disbanding all concepts of musical tags. It is no wonder she has shared stages with an array of diverse artists such as Annie Lennox, Billy Corgan, Maynard James Keenan, Ryan Adams, Elbow, The Gutter Twins, Snow Patrol, Miles Hunt (The Wonder Stuff), Mark Eitzel, and the legendary James Brown. 

&gt; Growing up in Wolverhampton, England, Carina, starting from a very young age, always had an affinity towards music and began to follow her musical dreams. Never losing sight of her goals, her determination and passion led to the recording of her first album The First Blood Mystery (2001). Shaped in the erratic but gripping sounds, her love of legends Patti Smith and Jeff Buckley resonates undeniably. 

&gt; The follow-up and Interscope re-released debut album: The Disconnection (2004) took those influences into much more powerful and personal realms. It landed Carina worldwide exposure in the process, which ultimately brought her career to Los Angeles, California. The relocation proved worthwhile. For Slow Motion Addict (2007), Carina teamed up with notable producer Glen Ballard to create a bewitching and seductive new album. Accompanying the release was a 12-part episodic series that cleverly coincided with each track, creating a visual story for the album. It gave Carina another medium to showcase her artistic ability by acting and starring as the troubled lead character, Maisie Scarlett. 

&gt; Two years later, Carina self-released the EP Things You Should Know in 2009 that resulted in more critical success, having multiple film &amp; TV shows feature her music as well as multiple radio stations, including KCRW, champion her music. Opportunities came flooding in to work with other artists Carina has admired over the years. 

&gt; Since 2009 she is also a member of the band Puscifer, the Solo-Project of Tool- and A Perfect Circle-Vocalist Maynard James Keenan, contributing the female and 2nd voice in live shows and on albums of the band. She also sang vocals on The Twilight Singers new album ‘Dynamite Steps’ along with other artists Nick McCabe (The Verve), Mark Lanegan, and Ani DiFranco, among others. In addition to this, Carina moved into the world of composing and writing for film, working with the award winning film composers John Debney and Glen Ballard on a song that was composed for the film Valentine’s Day, writing with Academy Award winner Marco Beltrami, as well as various others. 

&gt; In one of Carina’s co-writing sessions for film &amp; TV, a band was created called Early Winters with EMI Canadian artist Justin Rutledge, L.A. producer/musician Dan Burns and multi-instrumentalist Zac Rae. The band is an indie rock band with touches of country and folk flare, which draw comparisons to Neko Case and the Swell Season. 

&gt; All of these projects were an inspirational stepping stone for Carina to completing her newest album Tigermending which was released May 1st 2012 through her label Dehisce.

&gt; Life began for Kamasi Washington on February 18, 1981 in Los Angeles, California. In the Washington family music was more of a prerequisite than a privilege. But Kamasi never saw it that way, his love for music began at first sound. His father, Rickey Washington is a professional saxophonist by night and a high school music teacher by day. Kamasi’s mother, Valerie Washington is an accomplished flutist who fell in love with the world of science and became a high school chemistry teacher after her stint as a genetic researcher. By the age of two Kamasi had already began to play the drums and piano, the only thing that kept him away from the wind instruments at that early age was his lack of dental development. He began his exploration into the world of the reeds and brass when he was about seven and his father gave him a clarinet. By the age of twelve Kamasi had found his voice in the form of a tenor saxophone, in fact it was the same saxophone that his father played in high school. 

&gt; Over the next year Kamasi’s development and devotion to music had out grown his academic environment. So he transferred from The Los Angeles Center of Enriched Studies (one the top academic high schools in the nation) and enrolled into the Hamilton High School Music Academy. It was around this time that Kamasi also joined The Multi School Jazz Band (M.S.J.B.), an assembly of the finest young jazz musicians in Los Angeles County and led by Reginald Andrews the same man that taught Kamasi’s father in high school. Because of the sheer vastness of talent that he was surrounded by it was in The Multi School Jazz Band that Kamasi was most inspired during his high school years. Through M.S.J.B. Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi’s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as “The Young Jazz Giants”. 
This fiery group of “Young Giants” wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year “The Young Jazz Giants” had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. 

&gt; After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson’s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album “In My Time” which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi’s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called “Bird Man Records” heard him playing with “The Young Jazz Giants” and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the “big break” for “The Young Jazz Giants” but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after its completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay “ready and waiting” for too long, thus “The Young Jazz Giants” unofficially disbanded. 

&gt; Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called “The Next Step” and that’s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking. 

&gt; (2) Kamasi Washington didn't pick up a saxophone until he was 13 years old, but by that point, he'd been playing several other instruments. That's when he found his calling. Within a couple years, he was the lead tenor saxophonist at Hamilton High School Music Academy in his native Los Angeles. After graduation, he attended UCLA to study ethnomusicology. While enrolled at UCLA, he recorded a self-titled album with Young Jazz Giants, a quartet he had formed with Cameron Graves and brothers Ronald Bruner, Jr. and Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner, released in 2004. From that point, Washington continually performed and recorded with an impressive variety of major artists across several genres, including Snoop Dogg, Raphael Saadiq, Gerald Wilson, McCoy Tyner, George Duke, and PJ Morton. In 2014 alone, Washington demonstrated tremendous range with appearances on Broken Bells' After the Disco, Harvey Mason's Chameleon, Stanley Clarke's Up, and Flying Lotus' You're Dead!, among other albums that covered indie rock, contemporary and progressive jazz, and experimental electronic music. 

&gt;  The following year, Washington contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly and finally debuted as a leader with The Epic, released on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label. An expansive triple album nearly three hours in duration, it involved the other three-quarters of Young Jazz Giants -- by then part of his larger ten piece collective, altnerately known as The Next Step and West Coast Get Down-- string orchestra and choir conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. 

&gt;  The Epic was a critical and commerial success. Not only did it land at number three on the jazz charts, it also found its way on to independent albums and heatseekers charts as well. Washington and his band were not only able to tour the U.S., but to play in Europe and Japan as well. ~ Andy Kellman

&gt; The Murmurs were an American alternative pop music duo composed of singers/songwriters Leisha Hailey and Heather Grody. They began performing in 1991 while the duo were both students of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. With their self-released, debut album, Who We Are, the duo quickly attracted a cult following on the East Village club circuit. In 1994, The Murmurs signed with MCA Records. They released their self-titled LP the same year. The duo expanded into a four-woman group in 1997 with the addition of bassist Sheri Ozeki and drummer Sherri Solinger. They released Pristine Smut in 1997 and, a year later, Blender.

&gt; Hailey and Grody rejoined in 2001 as a new band entitled Gush. But the band Gush later split up due to Hailey's busy acting schedule.

&gt; In 2007 Leisha Hailey started another band called Uh Huh Her with Camila Grey and Alicia Warrington.

&gt; As of now Uh Huh Her consists of Leisha Hailey and Camila Grey. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Janelle Monáe (born Janelle Monáe Robinson on December 1, 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and performer.

&gt;  She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

I'm curious as to why this stigma ONLY exists in publishing. Doesn't exist in indie music. Indie artists who paint or sculpt don't see this stigma. Indie bookstores don't see this stigma. You never hear someone mock an indie bookstore for not being ""Waterstones"" or a ""Barnes and Noble"" type traditional big box store for books do you? A local computer repair shop owner isn't mocked or shunned for not being Geek Squad, are they? The small burger shop on the corner isn't mocked for having shitty burgers because they are a small mom and pop shop are they? No, they aren't, even though their music may suck, their art may suck, their books collection and store atmosphere and customer service may suck, their repair skills may suck, and their burgers and quality of meat may suck in comparison to another more popular and well established in the traditional arena for burger chains. Yet... if you see someone has indie published a book... it sucks right away without even reading it (the traditional stigma on indie publishing)? What?

I've always wondered exactly WHY indie publishing has had this stigma around it. It really seems like the only profession that does. The only thing I can think is that the indie label has been dragging self publishers down, but then that doesn't work across the board because indie music artists are doing amazingly well. Maybe indie music artists suffered this same stigma in the late 80s and it will just take another decade or two for this stigma to finally go away for book publishers? I don't know.

EDIT: indie video game developers don't suffer this stigma either, even though their first video games SUCK (for a great example of this, see the indie game publisher known as CD Project Red. The Witcher video game series? Yeah, the first one sucks ass, but the third is widely considered to be one of the best games of the last few decades). To expand on this further, you don't say that the first witcher video game sucks BECAUSE CD Project Red is an indie publisher. You say that the first witcher game sucks BECAUSE of the terrible combat and control scheme. You see the difference? Actual critique verses what amounts to a form of deeply held belief against or discrimination against the company (individual) because of the status of said company (individual) which made the product. I would never say that the game had terrible combat and terrible controls BECAUSE they were an indie publisher. NEVER. Big video game companies (like EA or Sony or Microsoft, etc.) publish many games with the same weaknesses as what the first witcher had.

Discrimination is NEVER justifiable. The sentiment you made in your post is just... absolutely terrible. Are you an indie reviewer or do you work for a company and review for them? If you're an indie reviewer... do people mock you for that status and not take your reviews seriously?

SECOND EDIT: Shit, I completely forgot to even mention indie film makers. Is there a stigma against them? Yeah, that's why some indie films have been nominated for academy awards, right? Because for every great indie film out there, they get bogged down by the thousands of shitty indie movies with terrible acting and editing, right?",[],,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_elegsb,,,,/r/selfpublish/comments/elegsb/backlash_for_being_selfpubbed/fdk5448/,public,False,,,,[],1578496266.0,r/selfpublish,0,,,,,,1372415431.0,,False,1587413917.0,,,

&gt; Mission of Burma is an American post-punk band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1979. The band was formed by Roger Miller (guitar), Clint Conley (bass), Peter Prescott (drums) and Martin Swope (tape manipulator/sound engineer). Miller, Conley and Prescott share singing and songwriting duties. Like many of their post-punk contemporaries, Mission of Burma's efforts are largely concerned with extending punk's original vocabulary without losing its essential rebellious spirit. Using rapid shifts in dynamics, unconventional time signatures and chord progressions along with tape effects, Mission of Burma challenges the prevailing idioms of punk while attempting to retain its power and immediacy.

&gt; In early years the band's audience was limited to the Boston area, with all their recordings released on the small Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. The band released only one album in its original form, Vs.. Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope, and has since recorded two more albums, ONoffON and The Obliterati.

&gt; Their wall-of-noise musical sound extended the vocabulary of punk while continuing to hold clear its sense of power and abandon.  They used a number of tape effects, different chord progressions, and time shifts to highlight their formal training in music.  Not only that but they are seen now as a highly influential band to both post-punk and experimental music to come after; many bands cite Burma as an inspiration, including Nirvana, Superchunk, Creed, The Grifters, R.E.M. (who regularly covered ""Academy Fight Song"" on their Green tour), Sonic Youth, Throwing Muses, Yo La Tengo, Soul Asylum, Pixies, Sugar, Catherine Wheel, Guided by Voices, Graham Coxon and Moby - the last two of which have covered """"That's When I Reach For My Revolver.""

&gt; The band were due to tour in 1980 with Joy Division but the suicide of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's singer, canceled the tour. In 1983, after releasing their only full-length studio record Vs., the group disbanded due to Miller's worsening tinnitus.

&gt; The band found increasing relevance throughout the 90s, culminating in the publication of Michael Azzerad's essays Our Band Could Be Your Life which featured Mission of Burma. In 2002, they reunited and began playing reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and formerly Prescott's Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller relates that ""when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin's position, we told him he could use current digital technology which accomplishes Martin's antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted for maintaining the original integrity, and uses a tape deck.""

EDIT: Thank you kind stranger! I always knew this day would come, but I never knew when. After every post, every comment, I ask myself ""is this the one? Will this be the piece of content to finally move someone to spend two bucks to make my experience on this app slightly better?"" That usually gets me thinking about the unique social dynamic Reddit's premium system fosters. Although most of their profits come from advertisers and their main product is us - the audience- it is interesting that the only product they provide for us to purchase is charity. It makes sense from a business perspective, as any free platform makes most of their money from a select group of high-spending users, their ""Whales"". However, standard premium memberships limit the spending capacity of each whale, since they can't buy themselves two premium memberships on the same account. However, by allowing them to provide that membership and recognition of quality to whatever other user they deem fit, Reddit allows the whales to spend as much as they want and keep the money flowing. This dependency on the altruism of Whales naturally draws some parallels to nature (pun intended). Nature's whales provide food, aid, and transport to all kinds of organisms, from the barnacle to the remora? But they are not essential to their survival. So too do the whales of Reddit help those who don't really need it but sure do appreciate it. Which brings me to my next point: the perceived value of gold and currency's worth in modern society. People often argue that money as a concept is manipulative because of its lack of inherent value, and that we should bring back some form of gold or silver standard. But that also presents a bit of a problem, because gold has no reason to be considered to be considered any more valuable than any other metal. Sure it looks nice, but what else has it got going for it? It's conductive, but I really doubt the gold sitting in Fort Knox is being used for circuitboards. It's not. It's only there to serve itself and sit around being valuable. And yet our entire world economy, and every system that depends on money, rely entirely on our perception that gold and currency hold value. What would happen if everyone decided to move on from gold? How would society collapse? What would end us first? Would we fight until there were none of us left? Would the collapse of every government bring about famine and disease, which would spread unchecked with no health organizations to stop it? Or would we mostly be fine, since most people are decent at heart? These apocalyptic hypotheticals entertain me, which is probably why I'm so drawn to high-brow intellectual entertainment on the nature of man, like Undertale or Rick and Morty. Stories like those just shake me to my core, with their potent character moments and plot twists, and I really can't understand how people can criticize them. If you can't appreciate the quality storytelling, acting, music, and tone that these tales convey, I'm sorry, but I will not weep for you. At that point, it's a choice you've made to ignore high-class intellectual entertainment. On a lighter note, I do appreciate the resurgence in popularity of Undertale, Megolovania in particular. This is naturally due to the post-launch support the game is receiving, which is unprecedented in scale, quality, and haste among indie games, and games in general. Never, in the history of entertainment, ever, has a piece of media received a second part of the scale or quality Undertale has this quickly, and I don't expect it ever to be topped. The only piece of entertainment media I could see getting the treatment Undertale has is Rick and Morty, because of the intense care and effort put in by the entire creative team, day and night, nonstop, for intellectuals like me. With that said, I really think we should discuss the creative bankruptcy of the television and film industries, since Rick's quest for galactic redemption seems to be at odds with the whims of studio executives. Funding seems to be driving everything dangerously towards what will make a profit rather than what is artistically valuable. Take Illumination studios. They take classic tales like The Grinch and Sing and push out the most unremarkable product they can on the lowest budget reasonable, and then market like they're on borrowed time. You cannot escape the Illumination marketing team. They're everywhere. Your TV, your memes, your aunts, etc. I liked Despicable Me, I thought it was a fine film, Steve Carrell was great, but the marketing for the spinoff made me retroactively hate a movie that used to be a favorite of mine. Hopefully their studio burns down before they finish work on that Shrek reboot, because I cannot stand to see that (Academy Award Winning) series tarnished by such a morally corrupt corporation.",[],,,AT-6,False,False,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Styria (Austria)'}]",False,,{'gid_2': 2},,,False,False,True,t3_eial97,,dark,,/r/europe/comments/eial97/happy_new_year_fellow_europeans/fcopl5k/,public,False,,,Styria (Austria),[],1577838194.0,r/europe,0,,,,,,1476292526.0,,False,1586451325.0,,,

With compelling lyrics and adept storytelling, their music shifts in mood from the insistent and heavy to the melodic and soulful, comprising the signature sound for which Floater is best known.

&gt; Floater's regional success was noticed by Elemental Records, who put out their first full-length record, ""Sink"" in 1994. That same year Floater began a string of sold out shows at the Community Center for the Performing Arts (The WOW Hall) that is still unbroken to this day.

&gt; In 1995 Floater released ""Glyph"" and toured the country for the next two years supporting the record. The single, ""Danny Boy"" received heavy college and commercial radio play, in many cities outselling major label releases. Floater received nominations to the preliminary level of the Grammy's from NARAS (National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences) in 1995 under Best Rock Performance for ""Sink"" and in 1996 under Best Alternative Performance for ""Glyph."" (Prelims are determined by nominations from the NARAS members).

&gt; In 1998, following their move to Portland, Oregon (where the band currently resides), Floater released their third full-length record, ""Angels in the Flesh and Devils in the Bone."" The second concept album by the band (""Sink"" was the first), ""Angel's"" brought a new vibe to Floater. It wasn't long before widespread audiences came to embrace what has now become the band's trademark - their versatility. 

&gt; September of 2000 brought the release of Floater's fourth full- length record, ""Burning Sosobra""; a musical collection that explores the band's broad range of song writing. Following its release, the band began to perform live acoustically. Both the band and the fans enjoyed this new avenue of performance that allowed the ""quieter"" side of Floater to emerge and be explored. Of late, the band has begun playing shows where acoustic Floater opens for electric Floater - giving a sort of Jekyll and Hyde feel to their performances.

&gt; In 2002 Floater released their most critically acclaimed record to date, ""Alter."" Combining the bands strongest musical elements, ""Alter"" moves fluidly from heavy riffs to lullabies and tells flowing stories of fear, love and above all change.

&gt; August of 2004 - The release of the band's acoustic record, ""Acoustics."" Fans of Floater's electric shows responded with enthusiasm to the band's occasional acoustic performance - with their record label's encouragement, the band put together a uniquely recorded album - one that mimics the sound of their actual performances. Recorded in a studio built in the ballroom of their producers house, the record was made without digital editing and has a fresh, live feeling. 

&gt; Floater is also the name of a late nineties indiepop band from Sheffield, UK. They briefly rename themselves Floater UK before later reforming as Dangerlust. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Mission of Burma is an American post-punk band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1979. The band was formed by Roger Miller (guitar), Clint Conley (bass), Peter Prescott (drums) and Martin Swope (tape manipulator/sound engineer). Miller, Conley and Prescott share singing and songwriting duties. Like many of their post-punk contemporaries, Mission of Burma's efforts are largely concerned with extending punk's original vocabulary without losing its essential rebellious spirit. Using rapid shifts in dynamics, unconventional time signatures and chord progressions along with tape effects, Mission of Burma challenges the prevailing idioms of punk while attempting to retain its power and immediacy.

&gt; In early years the band's audience was limited to the Boston area, with all their recordings released on the small Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. The band released only one album in its original form, Vs.. Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope, and has since recorded two more albums, ONoffON and The Obliterati.

&gt; Their wall-of-noise musical sound extended the vocabulary of punk while continuing to hold clear its sense of power and abandon.  They used a number of tape effects, different chord progressions, and time shifts to highlight their formal training in music.  Not only that but they are seen now as a highly influential band to both post-punk and experimental music to come after; many bands cite Burma as an inspiration, including Nirvana, Superchunk, Creed, The Grifters, R.E.M. (who regularly covered ""Academy Fight Song"" on their Green tour), Sonic Youth, Throwing Muses, Yo La Tengo, Soul Asylum, Pixies, Sugar, Catherine Wheel, Guided by Voices, Graham Coxon and Moby - the last two of which have covered """"That's When I Reach For My Revolver.""

&gt; The band were due to tour in 1980 with Joy Division but the suicide of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's singer, canceled the tour. In 1983, after releasing their only full-length studio record Vs., the group disbanded due to Miller's worsening tinnitus.

&gt; The band found increasing relevance throughout the 90s, culminating in the publication of Michael Azzerad's essays Our Band Could Be Your Life which featured Mission of Burma. In 2002, they reunited and began playing reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and formerly Prescott's Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller relates that ""when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin's position, we told him he could use current digital technology which accomplishes Martin's antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted for maintaining the original integrity, and uses a tape deck.""

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

it just feels like less because of two main reasons: 1. the way things are distributed now, for songs, on a song by song basis primarily, through digital providers like Spotify, Apple Music, etc; for films through streaming services and online rental sites, and

 2. the films now are mostly crap, and GOOD films are fewer and farther between that they ever were before. 

gone are the days of big summer blockbusters, fall tear jerkers with academy award promise, and regular cycles of distribution and promotion, now it's everything, at any time, with little or no promotion...and also indie films are more ""in"" than they have ever been because its now possible for anyone with an iPhone to make a fucking movie and release it (and they DO, several films in recent years have been done entirely on iPhones, and released in theatres to critical acclaim and commercial success)...plain and simple the quality just isn't there anymore like it once was

same for music, anyone can now make music and upload it to Apple music or Spotify or other sites and distributors, meaning there are more musicians than ever actually releasing stuff...but of course no one buys albums anymore, they buy songs, one at a time, for the most part

Frogger was 1 of my favourite Ps1 games and this gave me all those feels. addictive as hell 


9. TOTM (Tomb is the mask) 

Brilliant platform game. Fast satisfying gameplay excellent sound/visual  design. Play it 


8. PEGGLE 

I’ve bought this game on every platform over the years, just love this game. I see my old version doesn’t existed anymore. It’s probably a monetised shit show now

7. HERO ACADEMY

IMO one of the  best turn-based games to grace iOS. It had a system like ‘words with friends’ where you could make a move and return to it hours later. No idea why more games havn’t used this system, real shame they re-released it as a P2W piece of shit. R.I.P 

6. CLASH ROYALE

Even though it’s a P2W whore fest, the gameplay is so solid it had me addicted for years. The core game is undeniably brilliant 


5. TINY WINGS

a real classic iOS game, first app I ever brought and still holds up. bang on a chill playlist &amp; could play this for hours 

4. SLAYIN

insanely addictive RPG style game. Plays abit like a Roguelite. The music on this is Legit. Sometimes I just cruise the menus and jam out to the tracks 

3. HEARTHSTONE 

Best CCG I’ve played on all platforms, lives up to the hype has a passionate team behind it that isn’t trying to screw over the fanbase at every turn. I’ve spent a scary amount of time in this game. 

2. DEAD CELLS

I get massive stiffy for Roguelikes and this game is the king. Probably the best Indie game in recent years. 


1. DOWNWELL 

Probably the best platformer on iOS, it’s cool as fuck and requires real skill. It’s also a Roguelike which makes it that much more fun. Pure brilliance should come pre-installed on IOS.

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD ""Edgy In Brixton"" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London. The DVD contains a full live performance of the debut album Costello Music, B-Sides from various singles and a new song called Pretty Like a Girl. Extras on the DVD include the band being asked questions by members of The Fratellis' website, and on the deluxe edition, highlights from the T In The Park 2007 festival. It was released in the United States on the 30 October 2007

&gt; 2007-2008: Here We Stand

&gt; On November 20, 2007, it was announced on the Fratellis' official website that work had begun on the second album in rehearsal space in Glasgow. The band stated that they are self-producing the album and have their own studio to record in. Recording finished on January 13, 2008.

&gt; On February 22, 2008, they played a small show for fans at Queen Margaret Union to debut new songs from the upcoming album. About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. The first single from the album was called ""Mistress Mabel"" and was released on May 26, 2008. The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd. The Fratellis released a deluxe edition of Here We Stand internationally on December the 8th. The CD includes a new song titled 'Moriarty's Last Stand' and the accompanying DVD includes ""The Year Of The Thief"" (A documentary of the band on the road in the US); A live show filmed on June 18th 2008 at the Fillmore, San Francisco; performances of Milk and Money, Flathead and Mistress Mabel from Abbey Road Studios and the videos for the singles Mistress Mabel and Look Out Sunshine!
On April, 22 2010, both singer Jon Lawler and bassist Barry Wallace posted messages on their forum saying the band are unlikely to record together again soon.

&gt; The Fratellis have announced during June 2012 that they have decided to reform to help raise money for The Eilidh Brown Memorial Fund on the 15th of June at the MacRobert Centre in Stirling. The band plans on announcing more dates for later in the year.
The band then announced an extensive UK tour during December 2012 to take place in April 2013. During the UK tour, 3 more songs were debuted live; ""She's Not Gone Yet (But She's Leaving), Seven Days and Whiskey Saga.
On February 4th 2013, The Fratellis announced they had finished recording their third album, which was revealed to be called We Need Medicine with a release date of October 7th 2013. ""Seven Nights Seven Days"" was released as a single on September 29th. The album was recorded in Glasgow with Jon Fratelli and Stuart McCredie on production duties.

&gt; On the 24th of April 2013 it was announced that The Fratellis would be headlining Brownstock Festival in Essex on Sunday the 1st of September.

&gt; On the 22nd June 2013 The Fratellis headlined New College Commemoration Ball, a white-tie Ball set in the grounds of New College, Oxford.

&gt; Janelle Monáe (born Janelle Monáe Robinson on December 1, 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and performer.

&gt;  She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

* Network
* Network
* Network
* Network
* Network

Also - fucking mega top tip.  Go to festivals and *pay for the VIP access*.  The guest area in festivals is like shooting fish in a barrel for making friends in the industry.  Trust me.  They all go for a freebie to get pissed.

It is very much who you know - friends-of-friends kind of thing.  Obviously you can get lucky but it will help massively if you've met people at gigs, festivals or whatever.

Don't go in to the guest area trying to be professional, don't hand out business cards or whatever.  Literally make friends.  Just don't get too fucked up (not because anyone in the music industry will care, just because it's easier to keep on your toes a bit, chat-wise).  Make as many friends as you can.  You want to meet people around your age, but a bit older, with experience in an agency / label.

The way big agencies / labels work is, when they need to hire interns or whatever, they'll ask their juniors if they know anyone.

Hmm... wasn't actually expecting to give you decent advice here but I think this is pretty bloody sound.

Alternatively, get some experience in a marketing agency first.  Are you UK based?

Look for small indie labels and offer your services.  It's easier to get a foot in the door with them.

We run a free training academy at my agency twice a year in London, UK.  Next one's in January.

&gt; Life began for Kamasi Washington on February 18, 1981 in Los Angeles, California. In the Washington family music was more of a prerequisite than a privilege. But Kamasi never saw it that way, his love for music began at first sound. His father, Rickey Washington is a professional saxophonist by night and a high school music teacher by day. Kamasi’s mother, Valerie Washington is an accomplished flutist who fell in love with the world of science and became a high school chemistry teacher after her stint as a genetic researcher. By the age of two Kamasi had already began to play the drums and piano, the only thing that kept him away from the wind instruments at that early age was his lack of dental development. He began his exploration into the world of the reeds and brass when he was about seven and his father gave him a clarinet. By the age of twelve Kamasi had found his voice in the form of a tenor saxophone, in fact it was the same saxophone that his father played in high school. 

&gt; Over the next year Kamasi’s development and devotion to music had out grown his academic environment. So he transferred from The Los Angeles Center of Enriched Studies (one the top academic high schools in the nation) and enrolled into the Hamilton High School Music Academy. It was around this time that Kamasi also joined The Multi School Jazz Band (M.S.J.B.), an assembly of the finest young jazz musicians in Los Angeles County and led by Reginald Andrews the same man that taught Kamasi’s father in high school. Because of the sheer vastness of talent that he was surrounded by it was in The Multi School Jazz Band that Kamasi was most inspired during his high school years. Through M.S.J.B. Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi’s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as “The Young Jazz Giants”. 
This fiery group of “Young Giants” wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year “The Young Jazz Giants” had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. 

&gt; After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson’s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album “In My Time” which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi’s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called “Bird Man Records” heard him playing with “The Young Jazz Giants” and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the “big break” for “The Young Jazz Giants” but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after its completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay “ready and waiting” for too long, thus “The Young Jazz Giants” unofficially disbanded. 

&gt; Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called “The Next Step” and that’s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking. 

&gt; (2) Kamasi Washington didn't pick up a saxophone until he was 13 years old, but by that point, he'd been playing several other instruments. That's when he found his calling. Within a couple years, he was the lead tenor saxophonist at Hamilton High School Music Academy in his native Los Angeles. After graduation, he attended UCLA to study ethnomusicology. While enrolled at UCLA, he recorded a self-titled album with Young Jazz Giants, a quartet he had formed with Cameron Graves and brothers Ronald Bruner, Jr. and Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner, released in 2004. From that point, Washington continually performed and recorded with an impressive variety of major artists across several genres, including Snoop Dogg, Raphael Saadiq, Gerald Wilson, McCoy Tyner, George Duke, and PJ Morton. In 2014 alone, Washington demonstrated tremendous range with appearances on Broken Bells' After the Disco, Harvey Mason's Chameleon, Stanley Clarke's Up, and Flying Lotus' You're Dead!, among other albums that covered indie rock, contemporary and progressive jazz, and experimental electronic music. 

&gt;  The following year, Washington contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly and finally debuted as a leader with The Epic, released on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label. An expansive triple album nearly three hours in duration, it involved the other three-quarters of Young Jazz Giants -- by then part of his larger ten piece collective, altnerately known as The Next Step and West Coast Get Down-- string orchestra and choir conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. 

&gt;  The Epic was a critical and commerial success. Not only did it land at number three on the jazz charts, it also found its way on to independent albums and heatseekers charts as well. Washington and his band were not only able to tour the U.S., but to play in Europe and Japan as well. ~ Andy Kellman

&gt; Thurston Joseph Moore (born July 25, 1958) is an American musician best known as a singer, songwriter and guitarist of Sonic Youth. He has also participated in many solo and group collaborations outside of Sonic Youth, as well as running the Ecstatic Peace! record label. 
In 2012, Moore started a new band Chelsea Light Moving, with their first track, ""Burroughs"", released as a free download. Chelsea Light Moving's eponymous debut was released on 5 March 2013.

&gt; Moore was ranked 34th in Rolling Stone's 2004 edition of the ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time."" In May 2012, Spin published a staff-selected top 100 ranking Moore and his Sonic Youth bandmate Lee Ranaldo together on number 1.

&gt; Moore was born in Coral Gables, Florida and was raised in Bethel, Connecticut. Although he enrolled at Western Connecticut State University, he opted to move to New York City instead. There he learned to play guitar from Glenn Branca and soon co-founded Sonic Youth, serving as the band's guitarist and lead vocalist.

&gt; In 1985, he married Sonic Youth bassist, guitarist and vocalist Kim Gordon, with whom he has a daughter, Coco Hayley Gordon Moore. Thurston is known for playing Fender Jazzmaster guitars along with a host of other Fender models like the Mustang and Jaguar. Thurston is also very well known for being very harsh on his guitars.

&gt; In addition to his work with Sonic Youth, Moore has also released albums as a solo artist, one under the moniker David Adelmen, including 1995's ""Psychic Hearts"". He has collaborated with scores of artists, including My Cat is an Alien, DJ Spooky, Nels Cline, William Hooker, Christian Marclay, Loren Mazzacane Connors, R.E.M. and Cock E.S.P. In the mid-90's Moore formed a side band, The Dim Stars, with punk legend Richard Hell of Richard Hell and the Voidoids. In 2004, Moore performed in and produced an album for the all-star noise band To Live and Shave in L.A., the lineup of which also features Andrew W.K..

&gt; In 2004 Rolling Stone ranked him and Lee Ranaldo, of Sonic Youth, the 33rd and 34th best guitarists of all time. Their playing style is very innovative and they both use a large variety of extended techniques, like for instance their 3rd Bridge screwdriver technique.

&gt; Outside of his work as musical performer Moore runs the independent record label Ecstatic Peace and reviews new music in Arthur Magazine. In May 2005, he released the book Mix Tape: The Art of Cassette Culture.

The realm of imagination. That’s how I describe The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit, a journey of pain, loss and imagination presented through a creative child. Captain Spirit is able to touch mature themes such as alcoholism and loneliness by using representations of the imagination of Chris.

The main enemy of Chris is Mantroid, the combination of Mantle Street and Asteroid Drive, the place where Chris’s mom was murdered. This explains how Chris deals with the loss of his mother.

Chris’s father, Charles is someone who uses alcohol as a way to deal with the trauma of losing his wife, Emily. The interactions between Chris and Charles unveils sadness and impotence, at difference of the first time I played Charles seems how he wanted to blame someone, but after replaying it, his actions still bad, but represents his pain, even if that was not his intention.

There was some nice Links to Life is Strange such as Emily going to Blackwell Academy, or Mark Jefferson’s photography book, also Beaver Creek is not so far away from Arcadia Bay.

&gt; C Duncan (born Christopher Duncan, 29 July 1989) is a Scottish composer and musician. His debut album, Architect, was nominated for the 2015 Mercury Music Prize.

&gt; The son of two classical musicians, he was surrounded by music throughout his childhood. He initially took up piano and viola. His teens led him to school bands – learning to play guitar, bass and drums – but did little to quell his fascination with the composition and performance of classical music. He eventually enrolled in Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland) to study music composition, where his pieces were performed by various ensembles across the UK.

&gt; To hear C Duncan’s music now is to grasp those two common threads between his interests in classical and modern music. The pieces that make up his forthcoming debut LP are formed from lush choral harmonies and acoustic instrumentation, textured like contemporary dreampop and all recorded at home in Glasgow on his bedroom studio setup, gradually built up one layer and one instrument at a time. The results of this methodical and isolationist recording process give us charming lo-fi folk with the harmonic width of choral composition, the sweetness of barbershop and the rough eloquence that has so readily soundtracked Glasgow over the past decades.

&gt; He is also an accomplished painter, naming Grant Wood and Gerhard Richter as influences. His work has been exhibited throughout Scotland and he provides cover art for his own records, expressing the same musical ideas through painted image. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band formed in Bolton, Greater Manchester, UK in 1976, led by singer-songwriter and guitarist Pete Shelley (1955 – 2018) for nearly their entire existence.

&gt; They are commonly regarded as an important influence on the Manchester music scene, the independent record label movement and the punk rock, power pop, pop punk and indie rock genres in general. They are primarily remembered for their singles, a string of would-be hits that combined a strong grasp of pop song craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy. These singles were collected on Singles Going Steady, described by critic Ned Raggett as a ""punk masterpiece"" The widely covered ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" remains one of their best-known songs.

&gt; The name ""Buzzcocks"" partially comes from the Manchester slang term cock meaning youngster, and its use in the 1970s ITV drama serial Rock Follies which included the catch phrases ""that's the buzz, cocks"" and ""give me a buzz, cock!""

&gt; Buzzcocks were one of the key first generation British punk rock bands to form in the wake of the Sex Pistols in 1976. They were founded by Mancunians Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto, however Devoto left soon after the group released their Spiral Scratch EP (on their own independent label), leaving Shelley to take over vocals. 

&gt; They are best known for their catchy, poppy punk sound, which has been widely influential, which was adopted as Peter Shelley took over on the vocals, singing about what the whole punk rock scene opted not to sing about: love. Devoto in the meanwhile formed Magazine.

&gt; They rehearsed in a friend's kitchen and played at the all-day 100 club punk ""festival"", in London. At the end of 1977 the band signed to United Artists and released ""Orgasm Addict"", with Shelley's high-pitched vocal delivery and Ramones-esque fuzz-guitar sound ensuring the controversial single would be played over again. Later came ""What Do I Get?"" which hit the UK charts and showed Shelley's brilliance in songwriting.

&gt; An LP was then released, Another Music in a Different Kitchen which came with its own carrier bag, labelled ""Product"". In 1978-79 five chart-hitting singles were released including ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" and had captured a pop-loving audience by this time. Love Bites, their second LP was released later on, which had less excitement than the last album, though it did sell well, with Steve Diggle taking over lyric-writing.

&gt; October 1979 saw A Different Kind of Tension which was panned by some critics, quite unfairly, as it contains some excellent songs, the title track being the stand-out. It perhaps suffered from being the second album to be released that year, with the record company keen to capitalise on the band's chart success at the time. 

&gt; 3 more singles followed in 1980, but the spark had clearly gone out for a while. Musical differences and the long slog behind them led to the band splitting in early 1981. Pete Shelley embarked in a solo career.. 

&gt; He released three dance/electronic influenced solo albums: Homosapien, XL1 and Heaven and The Sea - all with the same fine songwriting skills. Meanwhile, Steve Diggle formed Flag of Convenience - a power pop combo -  and toured with some success. 

&gt; A 5 album/CD set was released in 1989 called Product, which contained all the albums to date, plus the greatest hits and B sides album, Singles Going Steady, and the last non-album singles, Why She's A Girl From the Chainstore, Airwaves Dream and Running Free, plus the B sides

&gt; In 1992 the Buzzcocks reformed, without original drummer John Maher and bassist Steve Garvey, and releasd Trade Test Transmissions in 1993, quite different from their earlier material, with nods to the power pop scene popular at the time. All Set in 1996 saw a return to form with familiar riffs and pin sharp lyrics pop-punk. Next year Chronology was released, the missing album, including outtakes from the three United Artists albums.  In 1999 they released Modern, which saw Shelley in reflective mode and Steve Diggle taking over more of the vocal duties.

&gt; Then followed another brief break in 2000, with Shelley teaming up with old band-mate Howard Devoto to release a largely disappointing album, Buzzkunst. Compilations followed, including Inventory in 2003, which contained every single to date, and 30 in 2005 to celebrate 30 years performing

&gt; 2005 saw the Buzzcocks back touring and in 2007 they released the superb Flat Pack Philosophy, widely agreed to rank up with the best of Buzzcocks output

&gt; 2008/9 saw a short tour where the band played tracks from Another Music and Love Bites.

&gt; In August 2011 they headlined the first night of The Rhythm Festival in Bedfordshire.

&gt; In November 2011 it was announced they would be playing two shows in 2012 that would feature the original line-up as well as the classic line-up of the band reunited for the first time in many years; these shows took place on 25 May 2012 in Manchester at the O2 Apollo and on 26 May in Brixton at the O2 Academy. It was announced on 26 May 2012 that, for the first time, they would headline Thursday night in the Empress Ballroom at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool sharing the stage with the likes of Rancid, Public Image Limited and Social Distortion.

&gt; On 1 May 2014 Buzzcocks released the album The Way via PledgeMusic. On 13 September 2014 Buzzcocks played ""a brief but triumphant set"" at Riot Fest 2014 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. In October 2014 Buzzcocks toured the U.K. for three weeks with The Dollyrots as main support.

&gt; In 2016, the band embarked on their 40th-anniversary tour (dubbed ""Buzzcocks 40""). In 2017, ""Why Can't I Touch It"" was featured in the opening segment of the Telltale game 'Guardians of the Galaxy.

&gt; Buzzcocks continue to be a huge influence on many bands and are still enjoyed by a large, and very loyal, fanbase.

&gt; (musical) artist, vegan &amp; alien luver.

&gt; Young Indie singer, multi-instrumentalist and producer creating eclectic digital pop with a soulful throwback voice.  

&gt; Meresha’s music has landed on Top 40 Billboard charts 3 times while her videos have been played internationally, including on MTV properties.  She's been the #1 Indie artist in the US for a month.   

&gt; In July 2017, Billboard named Meresha the #3 emerging artist globally. 

&gt; Meresha is a voting member in the Grammy process as part of The Recording Academy. 

&gt; Her 2017 EP is called ""Enter the Dreamland"" and includes production from multi-Grammy winner Joe Chiccarelli.  The song charts on the Billboard Heatseeker chart and was Top 10 on iTunes, Amazon and HMV charts.

&gt; * * * 

&gt; At the age of 12, Meresha recorded her song ""Fool Don't Be"" in a CD booth at a mall. Fun, refreshing, and totally independent, the song revealed exciting potential. Born in Europe, at 15 the singer and multi-instrumentalist uprooted her family, and headed for Florida. Her intense focus and Indie attitude garnered interest with young fans and supporters of independent music alike.  While her deep, soulful voice recalled a young Annie Lennox and Katy Perry, her quirky sonic vision drew comparisons to a Björk or Lorde. 

&gt; In 2015, she released the EP New Revolution, which included the title track and a trio of other songs that ranged in style from the Florence &amp; The Machine to FKA Twigs. Her sometimes frenetic eclecticism and eccentric beats created a fresh sound that brought old styles into contemporary production.  She performed songs from the EP live in concert with Adam Lambert and Third Eye Blind.

&gt; That same forward-thinking pop vibe carried into 2016 when she released the single ""My Love Has Come,"" which shifted focus from her innovative production to her vocal strength. 

&gt; Her late 2016 releases are""Together"" and ""Juntos"", which is Meresha's first song in Spanish.  A fun lyric video shot in the Bahamas and Florida introduces the song.

&gt; In December 2016, Billboard named Meresha the #6 emerging artist in the World, based on their ""Next Big Sound"" chart.

&gt; In June 2017, Meresha released her EP ""Enter the Dreamland"", including production from multi-Grammy winner Joe Chiccarelli.   She debuted 2 of the EP's song for some 40,000 fans at SunFest in Florida.  A video for the song ""Enter The Dreamland"" was directed by David Rousseau and shot in the L.A. River and at El Matador beach in Malibu.

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD ""Edgy In Brixton"" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London. The DVD contains a full live performance of the debut album Costello Music, B-Sides from various singles and a new song called Pretty Like a Girl. Extras on the DVD include the band being asked questions by members of The Fratellis' website, and on the deluxe edition, highlights from the T In The Park 2007 festival. It was released in the United States on the 30 October 2007

&gt; 2007-2008: Here We Stand

&gt; On November 20, 2007, it was announced on the Fratellis' official website that work had begun on the second album in rehearsal space in Glasgow. The band stated that they are self-producing the album and have their own studio to record in. Recording finished on January 13, 2008.

&gt; On February 22, 2008, they played a small show for fans at Queen Margaret Union to debut new songs from the upcoming album. About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. The first single from the album was called ""Mistress Mabel"" and was released on May 26, 2008. The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd. The Fratellis released a deluxe edition of Here We Stand internationally on December the 8th. The CD includes a new song titled 'Moriarty's Last Stand' and the accompanying DVD includes ""The Year Of The Thief"" (A documentary of the band on the road in the US); A live show filmed on June 18th 2008 at the Fillmore, San Francisco; performances of Milk and Money, Flathead and Mistress Mabel from Abbey Road Studios and the videos for the singles Mistress Mabel and Look Out Sunshine!
On April, 22 2010, both singer Jon Lawler and bassist Barry Wallace posted messages on their forum saying the band are unlikely to record together again soon.

&gt; The Fratellis have announced during June 2012 that they have decided to reform to help raise money for The Eilidh Brown Memorial Fund on the 15th of June at the MacRobert Centre in Stirling. The band plans on announcing more dates for later in the year.
The band then announced an extensive UK tour during December 2012 to take place in April 2013. During the UK tour, 3 more songs were debuted live; ""She's Not Gone Yet (But She's Leaving), Seven Days and Whiskey Saga.
On February 4th 2013, The Fratellis announced they had finished recording their third album, which was revealed to be called We Need Medicine with a release date of October 7th 2013. ""Seven Nights Seven Days"" was released as a single on September 29th. The album was recorded in Glasgow with Jon Fratelli and Stuart McCredie on production duties.

&gt; On the 24th of April 2013 it was announced that The Fratellis would be headlining Brownstock Festival in Essex on Sunday the 1st of September.

&gt; On the 22nd June 2013 The Fratellis headlined New College Commemoration Ball, a white-tie Ball set in the grounds of New College, Oxford.

Fine Arts - We have what is virtually universally considered the best ballet and opera companies in the US outside of NYC, and our symphony continues their triumphant march up the rankings (and the incoming director is one of the biggest coups for any symphony to nab in some time).  SF Ballet does well with the classics, but they are (IMO) untouchable when it comes to contemporary works.  The symphony does really fantastic live scorings of film (just got back last night from the composer of Get Out conducting the symphony through the music while the film ran, with the original vocal chorus from the film present as well).

Black Horse London Deli - The smallest bar in the city.  A true gem.  It is *maybe* six feet wide by 15 feet deep, and can fit 8-9 people at most.  They buy a couple different types of beers each day and that's it.  It forces everybody into conversation with each other, a true treat.

Li Po Cocktail Lounge - A classic dive in Chinatown.  Beware of the Chinese Mai Tais - they are at least four times stronger than you think they are.

An Japanese Restaurant - My favorite sushi omakase outside of Tokyo.  Expensive but not as pricy as the other high-end omakases.  Maybe seats 15 in the sadder part of the Japantown mall, but don't let that dissuade you.  Sit at the bar and get the nigiri omakase.

Alamo Drafthouse - My favorite place to watch a movie in the entire US.  Really good food and drink.  They do a lot of very fun events.  For example, the third Monday of each month they show a classic film (often sci-fi) and then afterwards an astrophysicist and chemist come on stage (often drunk out of their minds) and give a 15 minute powerpoint about the science in the movie.  We also went to a Jeff Goldblum mystery marathon where they screened four Jeff Goldblum movies back-to-back from 5:00-1:00 and you didn't know what the movie was going to be until each one started (and everybody got Jeff Goldblum jewelry).  They had a super fun Love Actually party where people got the infamous cue-cards.

August 1 Five - This one gets seriously fucking slept on in the SF restaurant pantheon.  Inventive modern Indian cuisine with killer cocktails, it's right by the Opera House/Symphony so you can combine it.

Smugglers Cove - A bit of a tourist trap at this point and always a wait, but it was voted Best Bar in America for a reason.  Super cool three-level Tiki bar with out of control decorations.

Park Days - On a beautiful sunny day, all the parks are buzzing.  Dolores is the most known, but I also love Alamo Square (very mellow), Washington Square in North Beach (very mellow + pizza) and Fort Mason (frat-tastic with incredible views).  If Alamo Square, get a sandwich at Fatted Calf before.  If Fort Mason, get a sandwich at Lucca Deli before.  If Washington Square, get a sandwich at Molinari's before.

Hayes Valley - Has some very fun outdoor bars (Anina, Biergarten, etc) when the sun is out.

Oracle Park - Top three ballpark in the country with incredible views.  Even if you don't like baseball, worth checking out.  Great food and the Giants suck right now so tickets will probably be dirt cheap next season.

Concerts - Fillmore and The Independent are two of my favorite venues ever.  Fillmore is steeped in history (free poster if the show sells out) and The Independent is really intimate.

Museums - Our fine arts museums (DeYoung and Legion of Honor) can't compete with NY and Chicago and DC when it comes to permanent collections, but they have deals with the Louvre which lends itself to some A+++ utterly incredible temporary exhibits at any given time.  SF MOMA is one of the best modern art museums in the world with masterworks galore.  I also love the Asian Art Museum (great permanent collection and phenomenal temporary exhibits) and they have Thursday nights where you can get cocktails etc.  Academy of Science also has Thursday nights where you can wander around the aquarium, rainforest dome, etc with cocktails.  Very fun date night.

Tommy's Mexican in the Richmond - SF institution.  Passable food, but the best margaritas ever and (I believe?) one of the widest selections of tequila in the world.  I read 300+ tequilas somewhere and I believe it.  Edit: Their website lists 311 currently available and claims it is the ""best selection on Earth"" whatever that entails.

Stern Grove - A beautiful wooded outdoor concert venue.  In the summer they have a free concert series with everything from indie rock to 70s funk to the ballet/opera/symphony.

&gt; Janelle Monáe (born Janelle Monáe Robinson on December 1, 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and performer.

&gt;  She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

&gt; Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band formed in Bolton, Greater Manchester, UK in 1976, led by singer-songwriter and guitarist Pete Shelley (1955 – 2018) for nearly their entire existence.

&gt; They are commonly regarded as an important influence on the Manchester music scene, the independent record label movement and the punk rock, power pop, pop punk and indie rock genres in general. They are primarily remembered for their singles, a string of would-be hits that combined a strong grasp of pop song craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy. These singles were collected on Singles Going Steady, described by critic Ned Raggett as a ""punk masterpiece"" The widely covered ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" remains one of their best-known songs.

&gt; The name ""Buzzcocks"" partially comes from the Manchester slang term cock meaning youngster, and its use in the 1970s ITV drama serial Rock Follies which included the catch phrases ""that's the buzz, cocks"" and ""give me a buzz, cock!""

&gt; Buzzcocks were one of the key first generation British punk rock bands to form in the wake of the Sex Pistols in 1976. They were founded by Mancunians Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto, however Devoto left soon after the group released their Spiral Scratch EP (on their own independent label), leaving Shelley to take over vocals. 

&gt; They are best known for their catchy, poppy punk sound, which has been widely influential, which was adopted as Peter Shelley took over on the vocals, singing about what the whole punk rock scene opted not to sing about: love. Devoto in the meanwhile formed Magazine.

&gt; They rehearsed in a friend's kitchen and played at the all-day 100 club punk ""festival"", in London. At the end of 1977 the band signed to United Artists and released ""Orgasm Addict"", with Shelley's high-pitched vocal delivery and Ramones-esque fuzz-guitar sound ensuring the controversial single would be played over again. Later came ""What Do I Get?"" which hit the UK charts and showed Shelley's brilliance in songwriting.

&gt; An LP was then released, Another Music in a Different Kitchen which came with its own carrier bag, labelled ""Product"". In 1978-79 five chart-hitting singles were released including ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" and had captured a pop-loving audience by this time. Love Bites, their second LP was released later on, which had less excitement than the last album, though it did sell well, with Steve Diggle taking over lyric-writing.

&gt; October 1979 saw A Different Kind of Tension which was panned by some critics, quite unfairly, as it contains some excellent songs, the title track being the stand-out. It perhaps suffered from being the second album to be released that year, with the record company keen to capitalise on the band's chart success at the time. 

&gt; 3 more singles followed in 1980, but the spark had clearly gone out for a while. Musical differences and the long slog behind them led to the band splitting in early 1981. Pete Shelley embarked in a solo career.. 

&gt; He released three dance/electronic influenced solo albums: Homosapien, XL1 and Heaven and The Sea - all with the same fine songwriting skills. Meanwhile, Steve Diggle formed Flag of Convenience - a power pop combo -  and toured with some success. 

&gt; A 5 album/CD set was released in 1989 called Product, which contained all the albums to date, plus the greatest hits and B sides album, Singles Going Steady, and the last non-album singles, Why She's A Girl From the Chainstore, Airwaves Dream and Running Free, plus the B sides

&gt; In 1992 the Buzzcocks reformed, without original drummer John Maher and bassist Steve Garvey, and releasd Trade Test Transmissions in 1993, quite different from their earlier material, with nods to the power pop scene popular at the time. All Set in 1996 saw a return to form with familiar riffs and pin sharp lyrics pop-punk. Next year Chronology was released, the missing album, including outtakes from the three United Artists albums.  In 1999 they released Modern, which saw Shelley in reflective mode and Steve Diggle taking over more of the vocal duties.

&gt; Then followed another brief break in 2000, with Shelley teaming up with old band-mate Howard Devoto to release a largely disappointing album, Buzzkunst. Compilations followed, including Inventory in 2003, which contained every single to date, and 30 in 2005 to celebrate 30 years performing

&gt; 2005 saw the Buzzcocks back touring and in 2007 they released the superb Flat Pack Philosophy, widely agreed to rank up with the best of Buzzcocks output

&gt; 2008/9 saw a short tour where the band played tracks from Another Music and Love Bites.

&gt; In August 2011 they headlined the first night of The Rhythm Festival in Bedfordshire.

&gt; In November 2011 it was announced they would be playing two shows in 2012 that would feature the original line-up as well as the classic line-up of the band reunited for the first time in many years; these shows took place on 25 May 2012 in Manchester at the O2 Apollo and on 26 May in Brixton at the O2 Academy. It was announced on 26 May 2012 that, for the first time, they would headline Thursday night in the Empress Ballroom at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool sharing the stage with the likes of Rancid, Public Image Limited and Social Distortion.

&gt; On 1 May 2014 Buzzcocks released the album The Way via PledgeMusic. On 13 September 2014 Buzzcocks played ""a brief but triumphant set"" at Riot Fest 2014 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. In October 2014 Buzzcocks toured the U.K. for three weeks with The Dollyrots as main support.

&gt; In 2016, the band embarked on their 40th-anniversary tour (dubbed ""Buzzcocks 40""). In 2017, ""Why Can't I Touch It"" was featured in the opening segment of the Telltale game 'Guardians of the Galaxy.

&gt; Buzzcocks continue to be a huge influence on many bands and are still enjoyed by a large, and very loyal, fanbase.

&gt; Pete Shelley died on 6 December 2018. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Thurston Joseph Moore (born July 25, 1958) is an American musician best known as a singer, songwriter and guitarist of Sonic Youth. He has also participated in many solo and group collaborations outside of Sonic Youth, as well as running the Ecstatic Peace! record label. 
In 2012, Moore started a new band Chelsea Light Moving, with their first track, ""Burroughs"", released as a free download. Chelsea Light Moving's eponymous debut was released on 5 March 2013.

&gt; Moore was ranked 34th in Rolling Stone's 2004 edition of the ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time."" In May 2012, Spin published a staff-selected top 100 ranking Moore and his Sonic Youth bandmate Lee Ranaldo together on number 1.

&gt; Moore was born in Coral Gables, Florida and was raised in Bethel, Connecticut. Although he enrolled at Western Connecticut State University, he opted to move to New York City instead. There he learned to play guitar from Glenn Branca and soon co-founded Sonic Youth, serving as the band's guitarist and lead vocalist.

&gt; In 1985, he married Sonic Youth bassist, guitarist and vocalist Kim Gordon, with whom he has a daughter, Coco Hayley Gordon Moore. Thurston is known for playing Fender Jazzmaster guitars along with a host of other Fender models like the Mustang and Jaguar. Thurston is also very well known for being very harsh on his guitars.

&gt; In addition to his work with Sonic Youth, Moore has also released albums as a solo artist, one under the moniker David Adelmen, including 1995's ""Psychic Hearts"". He has collaborated with scores of artists, including My Cat is an Alien, DJ Spooky, Nels Cline, William Hooker, Christian Marclay, Loren Mazzacane Connors, R.E.M. and Cock E.S.P. In the mid-90's Moore formed a side band, The Dim Stars, with punk legend Richard Hell of Richard Hell and the Voidoids. In 2004, Moore performed in and produced an album for the all-star noise band To Live and Shave in L.A., the lineup of which also features Andrew W.K..

&gt; In 2004 Rolling Stone ranked him and Lee Ranaldo, of Sonic Youth, the 33rd and 34th best guitarists of all time. Their playing style is very innovative and they both use a large variety of extended techniques, like for instance their 3rd Bridge screwdriver technique.

&gt; Outside of his work as musical performer Moore runs the independent record label Ecstatic Peace and reviews new music in Arthur Magazine. In May 2005, he released the book Mix Tape: The Art of Cassette Culture.

&gt; Life began for Kamasi Washington on February 18, 1981 in Los Angeles, California. In the Washington family music was more of a prerequisite than a privilege. But Kamasi never saw it that way, his love for music began at first sound. His father, Rickey Washington is a professional saxophonist by night and a high school music teacher by day. Kamasi’s mother, Valerie Washington is an accomplished flutist who fell in love with the world of science and became a high school chemistry teacher after her stint as a genetic researcher. By the age of two Kamasi had already began to play the drums and piano, the only thing that kept him away from the wind instruments at that early age was his lack of dental development. He began his exploration into the world of the reeds and brass when he was about seven and his father gave him a clarinet. By the age of twelve Kamasi had found his voice in the form of a tenor saxophone, in fact it was the same saxophone that his father played in high school. 

&gt; Over the next year Kamasi’s development and devotion to music had out grown his academic environment. So he transferred from The Los Angeles Center of Enriched Studies (one the top academic high schools in the nation) and enrolled into the Hamilton High School Music Academy. It was around this time that Kamasi also joined The Multi School Jazz Band (M.S.J.B.), an assembly of the finest young jazz musicians in Los Angeles County and led by Reginald Andrews the same man that taught Kamasi’s father in high school. Because of the sheer vastness of talent that he was surrounded by it was in The Multi School Jazz Band that Kamasi was most inspired during his high school years. Through M.S.J.B. Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi’s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as “The Young Jazz Giants”. 
This fiery group of “Young Giants” wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year “The Young Jazz Giants” had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. 

&gt; After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson’s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album “In My Time” which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi’s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called “Bird Man Records” heard him playing with “The Young Jazz Giants” and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the “big break” for “The Young Jazz Giants” but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after its completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay “ready and waiting” for too long, thus “The Young Jazz Giants” unofficially disbanded. 

&gt; Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called “The Next Step” and that’s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking. 

&gt; (2) Kamasi Washington didn't pick up a saxophone until he was 13 years old, but by that point, he'd been playing several other instruments. That's when he found his calling. Within a couple years, he was the lead tenor saxophonist at Hamilton High School Music Academy in his native Los Angeles. After graduation, he attended UCLA to study ethnomusicology. While enrolled at UCLA, he recorded a self-titled album with Young Jazz Giants, a quartet he had formed with Cameron Graves and brothers Ronald Bruner, Jr. and Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner, released in 2004. From that point, Washington continually performed and recorded with an impressive variety of major artists across several genres, including Snoop Dogg, Raphael Saadiq, Gerald Wilson, McCoy Tyner, George Duke, and PJ Morton. In 2014 alone, Washington demonstrated tremendous range with appearances on Broken Bells' After the Disco, Harvey Mason's Chameleon, Stanley Clarke's Up, and Flying Lotus' You're Dead!, among other albums that covered indie rock, contemporary and progressive jazz, and experimental electronic music. 

&gt;  The following year, Washington contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly and finally debuted as a leader with The Epic, released on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label. An expansive triple album nearly three hours in duration, it involved the other three-quarters of Young Jazz Giants -- by then part of his larger ten piece collective, altnerately known as The Next Step and West Coast Get Down-- string orchestra and choir conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. 

&gt;  The Epic was a critical and commerial success. Not only did it land at number three on the jazz charts, it also found its way on to independent albums and heatseekers charts as well. Washington and his band were not only able to tour the U.S., but to play in Europe and Japan as well. ~ Andy Kellman

&gt; For London-bred band BONES UK, every song is a chance to speak their minds, and to shed light on the disconnect between the status quo and the far more glorious world inside their heads. On their self-titled debut album, vocalist Rosie Bones and guitarist Carmen Vandenberg confront everything from the beauty industrial complex to toxic masculinity to music-scene sexism, embedding each track with choruses primed for passionate shouting-along. BONES UK offer up an album that’s both provocative and endlessly exhilarating, even in its most outraged moments.

&gt; True to the L.A.-based band’s anti-conformist spirit, BONES UK unfolds with an entirely uncontainable sound, a riff-heavy collision of rock-and-roll and rough-edged electronic music. On the album-opening “Beautiful Is Boring,” BONES UK bring artful riffs and sinister grooves to a feverish statement against societal expectations of beauty. “We’re living in an era when everyone’s being airbrushed into looking all the same, when really it’s imperfections that make you beautiful,” says Rosie. On “Filthy Freaks,” the band twists the narrative to an all-out celebration of the perfectly imperfect, the song’s bright tempo and surf-rock rhythms backed by Rosie’s brazen lyrics (e.g., “I like your leather/But I like it better on my floor”).

&gt; Growing up in Italy, Carmen began playing violin at age five, but soon felt compelled to take up guitar. “My dad played me a VHS of Woodstock, and when I saw Jimi Hendrix I just went, That’s what I wanna do,” she recalls. Classically trained in guitar from age six, she later ventured into blues and rock, eventually crossing paths with Rosie after playing a 2014 gig at a blues bar in Camden. “I went up to her afterward and we drank several bottles of whiskey, and we pretty much started playing together right away,” says Rosie. Born and raised in London, Rosie had gotten her start as a drummer but switched to guitar as a tool for her songwriting. “It’s always been all about the lyrics for me—using songs to tell stories and paint a picture, in a way that actually says something about the world,” she notes. Rosie also designs all the artwork for BONES UK, with the band working together to create each of their outrageously cinematic videos.

&gt; After recruiting Filippo (a former classmate of Carmen’s at The Academy of Contemporary Music in Surrey), BONES UK began pushing toward the complexity that now defines their music. “We all come from such different backgrounds, and BONES UK is the amalgamation of that,” says Carmen. “When we realized what we could create together, it was like we didn’t have a choice—we had to just keep going.” Moving to L.A. in 2017, the band made their name as an explosive live act, soon taking the stage at major festivals like Lollapalooza and touring with bands like Stone Temple Pilots, Bush, and The Cult.

&gt; BONES UK now see their live set as the ideal medium for their ever-expanding message, a vehicle for both catharsis and transformation. “Music is the most powerful platform you could possibly have, because it has the potential to move people in so many ways,” says Rosie. “We feel like we have a duty to use our platform to talk about the things we care about, and hopefully end up empowering and inspiring people, and help give them the confidence to be who they really are.”

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD ""Edgy In Brixton"" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London. The DVD contains a full live performance of the debut album Costello Music, B-Sides from various singles and a new song called Pretty Like a Girl. Extras on the DVD include the band being asked questions by members of The Fratellis' website, and on the deluxe edition, highlights from the T In The Park 2007 festival. It was released in the United States on the 30 October 2007

&gt; 2007-2008: Here We Stand

&gt; On November 20, 2007, it was announced on the Fratellis' official website that work had begun on the second album in rehearsal space in Glasgow. The band stated that they are self-producing the album and have their own studio to record in. Recording finished on January 13, 2008.

&gt; On February 22, 2008, they played a small show for fans at Queen Margaret Union to debut new songs from the upcoming album. About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; Mission of Burma is an American post-punk band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1979. The band was formed by Roger Miller (guitar), Clint Conley (bass), Peter Prescott (drums) and Martin Swope (tape manipulator/sound engineer). Miller, Conley and Prescott share singing and songwriting duties. Like many of their post-punk contemporaries, Mission of Burma's efforts are largely concerned with extending punk's original vocabulary without losing its essential rebellious spirit. Using rapid shifts in dynamics, unconventional time signatures and chord progressions along with tape effects, Mission of Burma challenges the prevailing idioms of punk while attempting to retain its power and immediacy.

&gt; In early years the band's audience was limited to the Boston area, with all their recordings released on the small Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. The band released only one album in its original form, Vs.. Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope, and has since recorded two more albums, ONoffON and The Obliterati.

&gt; Their wall-of-noise musical sound extended the vocabulary of punk while continuing to hold clear its sense of power and abandon.  They used a number of tape effects, different chord progressions, and time shifts to highlight their formal training in music.  Not only that but they are seen now as a highly influential band to both post-punk and experimental music to come after; many bands cite Burma as an inspiration, including Nirvana, Superchunk, Creed, The Grifters, R.E.M. (who regularly covered ""Academy Fight Song"" on their Green tour), Sonic Youth, Throwing Muses, Yo La Tengo, Soul Asylum, Pixies, Sugar, Catherine Wheel, Guided by Voices, Graham Coxon and Moby - the last two of which have covered """"That's When I Reach For My Revolver.""

&gt; The band were due to tour in 1980 with Joy Division but the suicide of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's singer, canceled the tour. In 1983, after releasing their only full-length studio record Vs., the group disbanded due to Miller's worsening tinnitus.

&gt; The band found increasing relevance throughout the 90s, culminating in the publication of Michael Azzerad's essays Our Band Could Be Your Life which featured Mission of Burma. In 2002, they reunited and began playing reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and formerly Prescott's Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller relates that ""when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin's position, we told him he could use current digital technology which accomplishes Martin's antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted for maintaining the original integrity, and uses a tape deck.""

&gt; Thurston Joseph Moore (born July 25, 1958) is an American musician best known as a singer, songwriter and guitarist of Sonic Youth. He has also participated in many solo and group collaborations outside of Sonic Youth, as well as running the Ecstatic Peace! record label. 
In 2012, Moore started a new band Chelsea Light Moving, with their first track, ""Burroughs"", released as a free download. Chelsea Light Moving's eponymous debut was released on 5 March 2013.

&gt; Moore was ranked 34th in Rolling Stone's 2004 edition of the ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time."" In May 2012, Spin published a staff-selected top 100 ranking Moore and his Sonic Youth bandmate Lee Ranaldo together on number 1.

&gt; Moore was born in Coral Gables, Florida and was raised in Bethel, Connecticut. Although he enrolled at Western Connecticut State University, he opted to move to New York City instead. There he learned to play guitar from Glenn Branca and soon co-founded Sonic Youth, serving as the band's guitarist and lead vocalist.

&gt; In 1985, he married Sonic Youth bassist, guitarist and vocalist Kim Gordon, with whom he has a daughter, Coco Hayley Gordon Moore. Thurston is known for playing Fender Jazzmaster guitars along with a host of other Fender models like the Mustang and Jaguar. Thurston is also very well known for being very harsh on his guitars.

&gt; In addition to his work with Sonic Youth, Moore has also released albums as a solo artist, one under the moniker David Adelmen, including 1995's ""Psychic Hearts"". He has collaborated with scores of artists, including My Cat is an Alien, DJ Spooky, Nels Cline, William Hooker, Christian Marclay, Loren Mazzacane Connors, R.E.M. and Cock E.S.P. In the mid-90's Moore formed a side band, The Dim Stars, with punk legend Richard Hell of Richard Hell and the Voidoids. In 2004, Moore performed in and produced an album for the all-star noise band To Live and Shave in L.A., the lineup of which also features Andrew W.K..

&gt; In 2004 Rolling Stone ranked him and Lee Ranaldo, of Sonic Youth, the 33rd and 34th best guitarists of all time. Their playing style is very innovative and they both use a large variety of extended techniques, like for instance their 3rd Bridge screwdriver technique.

&gt; Outside of his work as musical performer Moore runs the independent record label Ecstatic Peace and reviews new music in Arthur Magazine. In May 2005, he released the book Mix Tape: The Art of Cassette Culture.

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

&gt; Anya Marina is a singer-songwriter and radio disc jockey based in San Diego, Calif. Her music has been featured on the ABC television drama Grey's Anatomy (and its second soundtrack) and on shows such as MTV's The Real World. She is also track 6 on New Moon soundtrack. Anya is a former deejay on KBZT (FM94/9) in San Diego.

&gt; Anya was born in Ann Arbor, Mich., and grew up in the Silicon Valley area of California as a capricious child with Russian-Agnostic/Irish-Catholic professor parents (psychology and russian literature/math) and a younger sister. After finishing high school, Anya moved to Los Angeles as an aspiring actress. With stints in the British American Drama Academy (taught by Richard Dreyfuss, Marsha Mason, Anne Jackson and Eli Wallach) and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Pasadena, Anya has also acted in television and film (in 2001, she starred in the feature film, 100 Girls). She eventually moved back home to earn a college degree in English and writing at Santa Clara University. She continued to struggle as an artist -- working in acting, musical theatre, music, improv and comedy -- but eventually found a job as a radio DJ on KSCU, Santa Clara University's college station.

&gt; After graduating, Anya took a radio station job in San Diego with Mike Halloran at XHRM-FM (92.5). After the station was bought out by another corporation, Halloran hired Anya at Y107 in Los Angeles before they both moved to Premium Radio 92/1 in San Diego's North County. After leaving that station, both disc jockeys landed at FM94/9.

&gt; It was in San Diego that Anya played her first open mic night and began to write her own songs. She quickly developed a live stage act using what she learned as an actress, comic and impressionist. Her recorded debut was a five-song EP called Exercises in Racketeering, which eventually led to a full-length album, Miss Halfway, which was released in early 2005. Anya subsequently opened for such artists as Jason Mraz and Rhett Miller. She was named one of the ""Best Unsigned"" acts by San Diego CityBeat.

&gt; The songs on Miss Halfway talk about her upbringing, ex-boyfriends and all the after-effects. Anya's album was also produced by Scott Russo, the frontman for rockers Unwritten Law, along with Peter King from The Surfers. The record eventually earned a San Diego Music Award for Best Recording. The title track also landed on Grey's Anatomy and was featured as the fifth song on the second Grey's Anatomy (soundtrack) disc along with The Fray, KT Tunstall, Gomez and Snow Patrol.

&gt; The internet radio station KGRL featured her as their Flower-Powered Artist for March of 2007. The feature includes an exclusive interview, CD Review of Miss Halfway, and an on-demand audio stream of an unreleased Anya Marina track titled ""Try It And Like It."" Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band formed in Bolton, Greater Manchester, UK in 1976, led by singer-songwriter and guitarist Pete Shelley (1955 – 2018) for nearly their entire existence.

&gt; They are commonly regarded as an important influence on the Manchester music scene, the independent record label movement and the punk rock, power pop, pop punk and indie rock genres in general. They are primarily remembered for their singles, a string of would-be hits that combined a strong grasp of pop song craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy. These singles were collected on Singles Going Steady, described by critic Ned Raggett as a ""punk masterpiece"" The widely covered ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" remains one of their best-known songs.

&gt; The name ""Buzzcocks"" partially comes from the Manchester slang term cock meaning youngster, and its use in the 1970s ITV drama serial Rock Follies which included the catch phrases ""that's the buzz, cocks"" and ""give me a buzz, cock!""

&gt; Buzzcocks were one of the key first generation British punk rock bands to form in the wake of the Sex Pistols in 1976. They were founded by Mancunians Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto, however Devoto left soon after the group released their Spiral Scratch EP (on their own independent label), leaving Shelley to take over vocals. 

&gt; They are best known for their catchy, poppy punk sound, which has been widely influential, which was adopted as Peter Shelley took over on the vocals, singing about what the whole punk rock scene opted not to sing about: love. Devoto in the meanwhile formed Magazine.

&gt; They rehearsed in a friend's kitchen and played at the all-day 100 club punk ""festival"", in London. At the end of 1977 the band signed to United Artists and released ""Orgasm Addict"", with Shelley's high-pitched vocal delivery and Ramones-esque fuzz-guitar sound ensuring the controversial single would be played over again. Later came ""What Do I Get?"" which hit the UK charts and showed Shelley's brilliance in songwriting.

&gt; An LP was then released, Another Music in a Different Kitchen which came with its own carrier bag, labelled ""Product"". In 1978-79 five chart-hitting singles were released including ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" and had captured a pop-loving audience by this time. Love Bites, their second LP was released later on, which had less excitement than the last album, though it did sell well, with Steve Diggle taking over lyric-writing.

&gt; October 1979 saw A Different Kind of Tension which was panned by some critics, quite unfairly, as it contains some excellent songs, the title track being the stand-out. It perhaps suffered from being the second album to be released that year, with the record company keen to capitalise on the band's chart success at the time. 

&gt; 3 more singles followed in 1980, but the spark had clearly gone out for a while. Musical differences and the long slog behind them led to the band splitting in early 1981. Pete Shelley embarked in a solo career.. 

&gt; He released three dance/electronic influenced solo albums: Homosapien, XL1 and Heaven and The Sea - all with the same fine songwriting skills. Meanwhile, Steve Diggle formed Flag of Convenience - a power pop combo -  and toured with some success. 

&gt; A 5 album/CD set was released in 1989 called Product, which contained all the albums to date, plus the greatest hits and B sides album, Singles Going Steady, and the last non-album singles, Why She's A Girl From the Chainstore, Airwaves Dream and Running Free, plus the B sides

&gt; In 1992 the Buzzcocks reformed, without original drummer John Maher and bassist Steve Garvey, and releasd Trade Test Transmissions in 1993, quite different from their earlier material, with nods to the power pop scene popular at the time. All Set in 1996 saw a return to form with familiar riffs and pin sharp lyrics pop-punk. Next year Chronology was released, the missing album, including outtakes from the three United Artists albums.  In 1999 they released Modern, which saw Shelley in reflective mode and Steve Diggle taking over more of the vocal duties.

&gt; Then followed another brief break in 2000, with Shelley teaming up with old band-mate Howard Devoto to release a largely disappointing album, Buzzkunst. Compilations followed, including Inventory in 2003, which contained every single to date, and 30 in 2005 to celebrate 30 years performing

&gt; 2005 saw the Buzzcocks back touring and in 2007 they released the superb Flat Pack Philosophy, widely agreed to rank up with the best of Buzzcocks output

&gt; 2008/9 saw a short tour where the band played tracks from Another Music and Love Bites.

&gt; In August 2011 they headlined the first night of The Rhythm Festival in Bedfordshire.

&gt; In November 2011 it was announced they would be playing two shows in 2012 that would feature the original line-up as well as the classic line-up of the band reunited for the first time in many years; these shows took place on 25 May 2012 in Manchester at the O2 Apollo and on 26 May in Brixton at the O2 Academy. It was announced on 26 May 2012 that, for the first time, they would headline Thursday night in the Empress Ballroom at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool sharing the stage with the likes of Rancid, Public Image Limited and Social Distortion.

&gt; On 1 May 2014 Buzzcocks released the album The Way via PledgeMusic. On 13 September 2014 Buzzcocks played ""a brief but triumphant set"" at Riot Fest 2014 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. In October 2014 Buzzcocks toured the U.K. for three weeks with The Dollyrots as main support.

&gt; In 2016, the band embarked on their 40th-anniversary tour (dubbed ""Buzzcocks 40""). In 2017, ""Why Can't I Touch It"" was featured in the opening segment of the Telltale game 'Guardians of the Galaxy.

&gt; Buzzcocks continue to be a huge influence on many bands and are still enjoyed by a large, and very loyal, fanbase.

&gt; Pete Shelley died on 6 December 2018. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US.

&gt; Thurston Joseph Moore (born July 25, 1958) is an American musician best known as a singer, songwriter and guitarist of Sonic Youth. He has also participated in many solo and group collaborations outside of Sonic Youth, as well as running the Ecstatic Peace! record label. 
In 2012, Moore started a new band Chelsea Light Moving, with their first track, ""Burroughs"", released as a free download. Chelsea Light Moving's eponymous debut was released on 5 March 2013.

&gt; Moore was ranked 34th in Rolling Stone's 2004 edition of the ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time."" In May 2012, Spin published a staff-selected top 100 ranking Moore and his Sonic Youth bandmate Lee Ranaldo together on number 1.

&gt; Moore was born in Coral Gables, Florida and was raised in Bethel, Connecticut. Although he enrolled at Western Connecticut State University, he opted to move to New York City instead. There he learned to play guitar from Glenn Branca and soon co-founded Sonic Youth, serving as the band's guitarist and lead vocalist.

&gt; In 1985, he married Sonic Youth bassist, guitarist and vocalist Kim Gordon, with whom he has a daughter, Coco Hayley Gordon Moore. Thurston is known for playing Fender Jazzmaster guitars along with a host of other Fender models like the Mustang and Jaguar. Thurston is also very well known for being very harsh on his guitars.

&gt; In addition to his work with Sonic Youth, Moore has also released albums as a solo artist, one under the moniker David Adelmen, including 1995's ""Psychic Hearts"". He has collaborated with scores of artists, including My Cat is an Alien, DJ Spooky, Nels Cline, William Hooker, Christian Marclay, Loren Mazzacane Connors, R.E.M. and Cock E.S.P. In the mid-90's Moore formed a side band, The Dim Stars, with punk legend Richard Hell of Richard Hell and the Voidoids. In 2004, Moore performed in and produced an album for the all-star noise band To Live and Shave in L.A., the lineup of which also features Andrew W.K..

&gt; In 2004 Rolling Stone ranked him and Lee Ranaldo, of Sonic Youth, the 33rd and 34th best guitarists of all time. Their playing style is very innovative and they both use a large variety of extended techniques, like for instance their 3rd Bridge screwdriver technique.

&gt; Outside of his work as musical performer Moore runs the independent record label Ecstatic Peace and reviews new music in Arthur Magazine. In May 2005, he released the book Mix Tape: The Art of Cassette Culture.

&gt; Janelle Monáe (born Janelle Monáe Robinson on December 1, 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and performer.

&gt;  She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

&gt; 3 more singles followed in 1980, but the spark had clearly gone out for a while. Musical differences and the long slog behind them led to the band splitting in early 1981. Pete Shelley embarked in a solo career.. 

&gt; He released three dance/electronic influenced solo albums: Homosapien, XL1 and Heaven and The Sea - all with the same fine songwriting skills. Meanwhile, Steve Diggle formed Flag of Convenience - a power pop combo -  and toured with some success. 

&gt; A 5 album/CD set was released in 1989 called Product, which contained all the albums to date, plus the greatest hits and B sides album, Singles Going Steady, and the last non-album singles, Why She's A Girl From the Chainstore, Airwaves Dream and Running Free, plus the B sides

&gt; In 1992 the Buzzcocks reformed, without original drummer John Maher and bassist Steve Garvey, and releasd Trade Test Transmissions in 1993, quite different from their earlier material, with nods to the power pop scene popular at the time. All Set in 1996 saw a return to form with familiar riffs and pin sharp lyrics pop-punk. Next year Chronology was released, the missing album, including outtakes from the three United Artists albums.  In 1999 they released Modern, which saw Shelley in reflective mode and Steve Diggle taking over more of the vocal duties.

&gt; Then followed another brief break in 2000, with Shelley teaming up with old band-mate Howard Devoto to release a largely disappointing album, Buzzkunst. Compilations followed, including Inventory in 2003, which contained every single to date, and 30 in 2005 to celebrate 30 years performing

&gt; 2005 saw the Buzzcocks back touring and in 2007 they released the superb Flat Pack Philosophy, widely agreed to rank up with the best of Buzzcocks output

&gt; 2008/9 saw a short tour where the band played tracks from Another Music and Love Bites.

&gt; In August 2011 they headlined the first night of The Rhythm Festival in Bedfordshire.

&gt; In November 2011 it was announced they would be playing two shows in 2012 that would feature the original line-up as well as the classic line-up of the band reunited for the first time in many years; these shows took place on 25 May 2012 in Manchester at the O2 Apollo and on 26 May in Brixton at the O2 Academy. It was announced on 26 May 2012 that, for the first time, they would headline Thursday night in the Empress Ballroom at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool sharing the stage with the likes of Rancid, Public Image Limited and Social Distortion.

&gt; On 1 May 2014 Buzzcocks released the album The Way via PledgeMusic. On 13 September 2014 Buzzcocks played ""a brief but triumphant set"" at Riot Fest 2014 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. In October 2014 Buzzcocks toured the U.K. for three weeks with The Dollyrots as main support.

&gt; In 2016, the band embarked on their 40th-anniversary tour (dubbed ""Buzzcocks 40""). In 2017, ""Why Can't I Touch It"" was featured in the opening segment of the Telltale game 'Guardians of the Galaxy.

&gt; Buzzcocks continue to be a huge influence on many bands and are still enjoyed by a large, and very loyal, fanbase.

&gt; Pete Shelley died on 6 December 2018. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; The Academy Is... was a rock band which formed in 2003 in Chicago, Illinois, United States. The band's longest lasting lineup consisted of William Beckett (vocals, guitar), Mike Carden (guitar, vocals), Michael Chislett (guitar, keyboards), Adam Siska (bass) and Andy Mrotek (drums). The band released three albums - ""Almost Here"" (2005), ""Santi"" (2007) and ""Fast Times at Barrington High"" (2008) - before disbanding in 2011, several months after Chislett and Mrotek left the band.

&gt; William Beckett (singer) and Adam T. Siska's (bass) plans for starting a band together came to fruition on March 4, 2003 recruiting Mike Carden (guitar) after his former band, Jodie, which had members of Victory Records act June, broke up then eventually adding AJ LaTrace as a lead guitarist and Michael DelPrincipe (Little Mike) as a drummer. They recorded their self-titled debut EP, The Academy (2004), for the Chicago-based label LLR Recordings. LLR Recordings had previously released Beckett's solo project Remember Maine's debut album The Last Place You Look in 2002 and Mike Carden's solo folk album in 2003. The EP was recorded in Villa Park, IL at The Gallery of Carpet by producer Brian Zieske. Pete Wentz from Fall Out Boy heard it and was impressed. The label Fueled by Ramen immediately signed the band.

&gt; In 2004 the band headed to Florida to record their Fueled by Ramen debut Almost Here, produced by James Paul Wisner, who has worked with Dashboard Confessional, Something Corporate, Further Seems Forever, and Underoath. After recording the album and a doing a summer tour, the band underwent a lineup change. Thomas Conrad, formerly of Chicago local band 5o4plan, replaced LaTrace as the second guitarist/backing vocalist and Andy Mrotek, formerly of Last Place Champs, replaced DelPrincipe as the drummer. Andy Mrotek and Thomas Conrad are listed in the liner notes, but were added to the band after the recording of Almost Here to replace DelPrincipe and LaTrace, respectively. They hit the road hard, touring with Fall Out Boy, Something Corporate, Midtown, Matchbook Romance, Motion City Soundtrack and Armor for Sleep. The album was released on February 8, 2005 and the following summer, the band embarked on their first headlining tour alongside Plain White T's, Days Away and June. On Billboard's charts Almost Here peaked at #7 on Top Heatseekers, #16 on Independent Albums, and #185 on The Billboard 200.

&gt; On October 26, 2006, The Academy Is... had announced via the blog on their official website that Thomas Conrad and the band had parted ways. Michael Guy Chislett joined the band to replace Conrad on guitar.

&gt; While touring as a main act on the 2006 Warped Tour, the band began the process of writing songs for their second album. Once finished, the band flew to Los Angeles to record their record with Butch Walker. As of December 23, 2006, the band had officially finished the recording process and the album, entitled Santi, was released April 3, 2007 on the Fueled By Ramen label. The release of this album was listed on Blender's 25 reasons to love 2007. On January 26, 2007 a sample of ""LAX to O'Hare"" was released on the band's AbsolutePunk profile. The album peaked at #32 on the Billboard 200.

&gt; The band went on to release the song ""We've Got a Big Mess on Our Hands"" as the album's first single, before releasing the album on April 3, 2007. Fall Out Boy, +44, Cobra Starship, and Paul Wall all joined the band on the 2007 Honda Civic Tour, after which the band moved on to the ""Sleeping With Giants"" tour with support from The Rocket Summer, Armor for Sleep and Sherwood. Partly through the tour, Cobra Starship was added to the support. The tour ended on November 24, 2007 in Chicago.

&gt; The band's third studio album, Fast Times at Barrington High, was released on August 19, 2008 through Fueled by Ramen. The title refers to the high school William Beckett, Adam Siska, and videographer Jack Edinger attended. The first single, ""About a Girl,"" was added to the band's MySpace page on July 15, 2008 and was subsequently made available from various download sites. The lead model in the official music video for ""About a Girl"", Brittany Moser, also went to Barrington the same time Adam and William were in high school. On August 25, 2008 ""About a Girl"" was played on The Hills (season 4, episode 2). They also released the songs ""Summer Hair = Forever Young"" and ""His Girl Friday"" of FTABH on their MySpace page and PureVolume page. The album made it onto Rolling Stone Magazine's 50 Best Albums of the Year ranked as #46. It peaked at #17 on The Billboard 200

&gt; On William Beckett's Twitter page, it was said The Academy Is... have finished recording their new EP, Lost in Pacific Time: The AP/EP. It was released on September 22, 2009 on iTunes, and will be sold on the AP Fall Ball Tour. A limited number will also be sold on their webstore The track ""I'm Yours Tonight"" has already been released, and is on the band's Myspace page. Another track, ""Days Like Masquerades"" was played at an anti-suicide benefit at Barrington High School, in Barrington, Illinois. William has also been posting or linking lyrics on his blog. The newest song, ""Sputter"" (featuring Jack's Mannequin singer Andrew McMahon), is streaming on Banana's Music club, linked by both William and Pete Wentz via Twitter on September 21.[citation needed] On September 29, 2009, Pete Wentz announced via Twitter that TAI would replace The All-American Rejects for the St. Louis date of the Blink-182 tour, due to an injury to the AAR lead singer Tyson Ritter.

&gt; On May 26, the band announced that they will be supporting Kiss on their upcoming summer tour. The band also said that this tour will not affect the release date or direction of their new record.

&gt; On the tour with Kiss, they have been playing a cover of Sweet's ""Fox on the Run"", of which they contributed a recorded version to the soundtrack of the movie When In Rome. It is unclear though, whether the song will appear on the band's upcoming studio album.

&gt; On March 23, 2011, William Beckett tweeted that the band is currently making demos for the upcoming album.

&gt; On May 24, 2011, The Academy Is... made an announcement on their official website that said that fellow bandmates, Andy Mrotek &amp; Michael Guy Chislett, were leaving the band to pursue their own musical careers. There has reportedly been no hard feelings during this decision. William Beckett also stated that the three remaining members would be entering the studio soon to record their fourth full-length album. This announcement featured a minute-and-a-half snippet of a track called ""Chicago"". Whether or not Mrotek and Chislett collaborated on the track is unknown.

&gt; On May 26, 2011, William Beckett tweeted that they had entered and recorded in the studio.

&gt; On October 8, 2011, The Academy Is... announced their disbanding on their official Facebook page, stating that they had ""decided to go [their] separate ways."" Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Mission of Burma is an American post-punk band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1979. The band was formed by Roger Miller (guitar), Clint Conley (bass), Peter Prescott (drums) and Martin Swope (tape manipulator/sound engineer). Miller, Conley and Prescott share singing and songwriting duties. Like many of their post-punk contemporaries, Mission of Burma's efforts are largely concerned with extending punk's original vocabulary without losing its essential rebellious spirit. Using rapid shifts in dynamics, unconventional time signatures and chord progressions along with tape effects, Mission of Burma challenges the prevailing idioms of punk while attempting to retain its power and immediacy.

&gt; In early years the band's audience was limited to the Boston area, with all their recordings released on the small Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. The band released only one album in its original form, Vs.. Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope, and has since recorded two more albums, ONoffON and The Obliterati.

&gt; Their wall-of-noise musical sound extended the vocabulary of punk while continuing to hold clear its sense of power and abandon.  They used a number of tape effects, different chord progressions, and time shifts to highlight their formal training in music.  Not only that but they are seen now as a highly influential band to both post-punk and experimental music to come after; many bands cite Burma as an inspiration, including Nirvana, Superchunk, Creed, The Grifters, R.E.M. (who regularly covered ""Academy Fight Song"" on their Green tour), Sonic Youth, Throwing Muses, Yo La Tengo, Soul Asylum, Pixies, Sugar, Catherine Wheel, Guided by Voices, Graham Coxon and Moby - the last two of which have covered """"That's When I Reach For My Revolver.""

&gt; The band were due to tour in 1980 with Joy Division but the suicide of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's singer, canceled the tour. In 1983, after releasing their only full-length studio record Vs., the group disbanded due to Miller's worsening tinnitus.

&gt; The band found increasing relevance throughout the 90s, culminating in the publication of Michael Azzerad's essays Our Band Could Be Your Life which featured Mission of Burma. In 2002, they reunited and began playing reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and formerly Prescott's Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller relates that ""when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin's position, we told him he could use current digital technology which accomplishes Martin's antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted for maintaining the original integrity, and uses a tape deck.""

&gt; Luis Enríquez Bacalov (Buenos Aires, Argentina, 30 March, 1933 - 15 November 2017)) was a prolific Argentine-born composer of film scores, of Bulgarian origin. Early on in his career, he composed scores for Spaghetti Western films, including Django, Storm Rider and The Price of Power. Bacalov was nominated twice for the Academy Award for Original Score -music adaptation or treatment-, in 1967 for Pasolini's The Gospel According to St. Matthew, and winning the award for Il Postino in 1996.

&gt; You can hear ""The Grand Duel (Parte Prima)"" in the Volume 1 of Kill Bill, a film by Quentin Tarantino.
In the early 1970s, he collaborated with Italian progressive rock bands New Trolls and Osanna.

&gt; In recent years, Bacalov has also composed significant works for chorus and orchestra, including his Missa Tango , a work setting the classic liturgical mass to the rhythms of his native Argentina, which was debuted in Rome by Placido Domingo in 2000. This work was later recorded by Domingo for Deutsche Grammophon. Bacalov recently composed Cantones de Nuestro Tiempos (Psalms for our Times): The Cambridge Psalms, a commissioned work with text from the Psalms of David for baritone and soprano soloists, orchestra and chorus, which had its world premiere at Sanders Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts in spring 2006 by the Cambridge Community Chorus (William E. Thomas, Music Director).

&gt; Two of his songs, ""The Grand Duel (Parte Prima)"" and ""Summertime Killer"", were used in Quentin Tarantino's film Kill Bill (2003). Tarantino also used three Bacalov songs from the Spaghetti western era in his 2012 movie Django Unchained: ""Django"" and ""La Corsa (2nd Version)"" originally from Django (1966), and ""Lo Chiamavano King"" from His Name Was King.

&gt; Bacalov was the first to write a triple-concerto for bandoneón, piano, soprano and symphony orchestra: Tango Music with Symphonic Proportions.

&gt; From 2005 to his death, he was the principal director of Orchestra della Magna Grecia in Taranto, southern Italy.

&gt; He was considered a brilliant pianist in his time.

&gt; He died in Rome on 15 November 2017 at the age of 84.

&gt; Floater began in 1993 when Robert Wynia (lead vocals, bass), Peter Cornett (drums), and Dave Amador (guitar), got together in Eugene, Oregon, making their start at garage parties and the U of O beer garden. With compelling lyrics and adept storytelling, their music shifts in mood from the insistent and heavy to the melodic and soulful, comprising the signature sound for which Floater is best known.

&gt; Floater's regional success was noticed by Elemental Records, who put out their first full-length record, ""Sink"" in 1994. That same year Floater began a string of sold out shows at the Community Center for the Performing Arts (The WOW Hall) that is still unbroken to this day.

&gt; In 1995 Floater released ""Glyph"" and toured the country for the next two years supporting the record. The single, ""Danny Boy"" received heavy college and commercial radio play, in many cities outselling major label releases. Floater received nominations to the preliminary level of the Grammy's from NARAS (National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences) in 1995 under Best Rock Performance for ""Sink"" and in 1996 under Best Alternative Performance for ""Glyph."" (Prelims are determined by nominations from the NARAS members).

&gt; In 1998, following their move to Portland, Oregon (where the band currently resides), Floater released their third full-length record, ""Angels in the Flesh and Devils in the Bone."" The second concept album by the band (""Sink"" was the first), ""Angel's"" brought a new vibe to Floater. It wasn't long before widespread audiences came to embrace what has now become the band's trademark - their versatility. 

&gt; September of 2000 brought the release of Floater's fourth full- length record, ""Burning Sosobra""; a musical collection that explores the band's broad range of song writing. Following its release, the band began to perform live acoustically. Both the band and the fans enjoyed this new avenue of performance that allowed the ""quieter"" side of Floater to emerge and be explored. Of late, the band has begun playing shows where acoustic Floater opens for electric Floater - giving a sort of Jekyll and Hyde feel to their performances.

&gt; In 2002 Floater released their most critically acclaimed record to date, ""Alter."" Combining the bands strongest musical elements, ""Alter"" moves fluidly from heavy riffs to lullabies and tells flowing stories of fear, love and above all change.

&gt; August of 2004 - The release of the band's acoustic record, ""Acoustics."" Fans of Floater's electric shows responded with enthusiasm to the band's occasional acoustic performance - with their record label's encouragement, the band put together a uniquely recorded album - one that mimics the sound of their actual performances. Recorded in a studio built in the ballroom of their producers house, the record was made without digital editing and has a fresh, live feeling. 

&gt; Floater is also the name of a late nineties indiepop band from Sheffield, UK. They briefly rename themselves Floater UK before later reforming as Dangerlust. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; The Murmurs were an American alternative pop music duo composed of singers/songwriters Leisha Hailey and Heather Grody. They began performing in 1991 while the duo were both students of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. With their self-released, debut album, Who We Are, the duo quickly attracted a cult following on the East Village club circuit. In 1994, The Murmurs signed with MCA Records. They released their self-titled LP the same year. The duo expanded into a four-woman group in 1997 with the addition of bassist Sheri Ozeki and drummer Sherri Solinger. They released Pristine Smut in 1997 and, a year later, Blender.

&gt; Hailey and Grody rejoined in 2001 as a new band entitled Gush. But the band Gush later split up due to Hailey's busy acting schedule.

&gt; In 2007 Leisha Hailey started another band called Uh Huh Her with Camila Grey and Alicia Warrington.

&gt; As of now Uh Huh Her consists of Leisha Hailey and Camila Grey. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Jóhann Gunnar Jóhannsson (19 September 1969 – 9 February 2018) was an Icelandic composer who wrote music for a wide array of media including theatre, dance, television and films. His work is stylized by its blending of traditional orchestration with contemporary electronic elements.

&gt; Jóhann released solo albums from 2002 onward. In 2016, he signed with Deutsche Grammophon, through which he released his last solo album, Orphée. Some of his works in film include the original scores for Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners, Sicario, and Arrival, and James Marsh's The Theory of Everything. Jóhann was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score for both The Theory of Everything and Sicario, and won a Golden Globe for Best Original Score for the former. He was a music and sound consultant on Mother!, directed by Darren Aronofsky in 2017. His scores for Mary Magdalene and Mandy were released posthumously. 

&gt; Jóhann was born on 19 September 1969 in Reykjavík, Iceland to Jóhann Gunnarsson and Edda Thorkelsdóttir. He learned piano and trombone from age 11, but had given them up by the time he went on to study languages and literature at the University of Iceland. Jóhann started his musical career in the late 1980s in the proto-shoegaze influenced band Daisy Hill Puppy Farm who released a couple of EPs which were played by British DJ John Peel and received a fan letter from Steve Albini. He went on to work as a guitarist and producer playing in Icelandic indie rock bands, like Olympia, Unun and Ham. In 1999, Jóhann co-founded Kitchen Motors; a think tank, art organisation and music label that encouraged interdisciplinary collaborations between artists from punk, jazz, classical, metal and electronic music. His own sound arose out of these musical experimentations. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Floater began in 1993 when Robert Wynia (lead vocals, bass), Peter Cornett (drums), and Dave Amador (guitar), got together in Eugene, Oregon, making their start at garage parties and the U of O beer garden. With compelling lyrics and adept storytelling, their music shifts in mood from the insistent and heavy to the melodic and soulful, comprising the signature sound for which Floater is best known.

&gt; Floater's regional success was noticed by Elemental Records, who put out their first full-length record, ""Sink"" in 1994. That same year Floater began a string of sold out shows at the Community Center for the Performing Arts (The WOW Hall) that is still unbroken to this day.

&gt; In 1995 Floater released ""Glyph"" and toured the country for the next two years supporting the record. The single, ""Danny Boy"" received heavy college and commercial radio play, in many cities outselling major label releases. Floater received nominations to the preliminary level of the Grammy's from NARAS (National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences) in 1995 under Best Rock Performance for ""Sink"" and in 1996 under Best Alternative Performance for ""Glyph."" (Prelims are determined by nominations from the NARAS members).

&gt; In 1998, following their move to Portland, Oregon (where the band currently resides), Floater released their third full-length record, ""Angels in the Flesh and Devils in the Bone."" The second concept album by the band (""Sink"" was the first), ""Angel's"" brought a new vibe to Floater. It wasn't long before widespread audiences came to embrace what has now become the band's trademark - their versatility. 

&gt; September of 2000 brought the release of Floater's fourth full- length record, ""Burning Sosobra""; a musical collection that explores the band's broad range of song writing. Following its release, the band began to perform live acoustically. Both the band and the fans enjoyed this new avenue of performance that allowed the ""quieter"" side of Floater to emerge and be explored. Of late, the band has begun playing shows where acoustic Floater opens for electric Floater - giving a sort of Jekyll and Hyde feel to their performances.

&gt; In 2002 Floater released their most critically acclaimed record to date, ""Alter."" Combining the bands strongest musical elements, ""Alter"" moves fluidly from heavy riffs to lullabies and tells flowing stories of fear, love and above all change.

&gt; August of 2004 - The release of the band's acoustic record, ""Acoustics."" Fans of Floater's electric shows responded with enthusiasm to the band's occasional acoustic performance - with their record label's encouragement, the band put together a uniquely recorded album - one that mimics the sound of their actual performances. Recorded in a studio built in the ballroom of their producers house, the record was made without digital editing and has a fresh, live feeling. 

&gt; Floater is also the name of a late nineties indiepop band from Sheffield, UK. They briefly rename themselves Floater UK before later reforming as Dangerlust. Read more on Last.fm.

For Blue October I totally would suggest checking out Frightened Rabbit's album [Midnight Organ Fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlvydBPSBLM). It's got that dark, introspective and emotional feel and some great music. [Manchester Orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9ZGN_eAEbA) is another good band for this type of music.  
  
 For A Day To Remember I would totally recommend Tell All your Friends by [Taking Back Sunday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uci5svBndfE). I'm not a big fan of their other albums but Tell All Your Friends is an amazing album. You might even dig [Full Collapse by Thursday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zlnil-v3dg). It's a bit screamy but not band. If you like them don't mind the screamed vocals check out Under [The Radar by Grade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_kyk0TNEeY). It's not all screaming but it's a bit more that way than Thursday, but it's got some KILLER catchy music. One other amazing album is [Domestica by Cursive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9olfqw7wX48). It's one of my all time favorite albums....Ok so I just listened to a bit of Wage War and all of those suggestions I mentioned you will probably really love.

There's the lack of diversity in music interests in Korea, with most people just gravitating towards K-pop because, hey, it's their nationality and they're sort of obligated to support this national-branded music endeavour, even if they don't like idol pop. So there's very little competition from actual indie labels which operate on a much smaller scale. 

The creation of idol groups is highly standardised, from training to audition to debut, and there's a high volume of trainees going into countless idol groups you never end up hearing about. It's sort of a McDonaldised approach to running a music industry.

The major entertainment companies are involved in horizontal and vertical integration. Horizontal meaning they have a wide range of interests including TV shows, nightclubs, talent agencies, academies, real estate, and other less related and less legal businesses, and vertical meaning there's a lot of economic activity to take a young child and turn it into a K-pop idol, meaning a lot of parents are paying a fortune for their children to one day have a shot at fame.",[],,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,,True,t3_chbkhs,,,,/r/korea/comments/chbkhs/why_sks_music_industry_is_dominated_by_indie/eutcyal/,public,False,,,,,1564023811.0,r/korea,0,,,,,,1407903285.0,,False,1572821313.0,[],,

I always knew this day would come, but I never knew when. After every post, every comment, I ask myself ""is this the one? Will this be the piece of content to finally move someone to spend five bucks to make my experience on this app slightly better?"" That usually gets me thinking about the unique social dynamic Reddit's premium system fosters. Although most of their profits come from advertisers and their main product is us - the audience- it is interesting that the only product they provide for us to purchase is charity. It makes sense from a business perspective, as any free platform makes most of their money from a select group of high-spending users, their ""Whales"". However, standard premium memberships limit the spending capacity of each whale, since they can't buy themselves two premium memberships on the same account. However, by allowing them to provide that membership and recognition of quality to whatever other user they deem fit, Reddit allows the whales to spend as much as they want and keep the money flowing. This dependency on the altruism of Whales naturally draws some parallels to nature (pun intended). Nature's whales provide food, aid, and transport to all kinds of organisms, from the barnacle to the remora? But they are not essential to their survival. So too do the whales of Reddit help those who don't really need it but sure do appreciate it. Which brings me to my next point: the perceived value of gold and currency's worth in modern society. People often argue that money as a concept is manipulative because of its lack of inherent value, and that we should bring back some form of gold or silver standard. But that also presents a bit of a problem, because gold has no reason to be considered to be considered any more valuable than any other metal. Sure it looks nice, but what else has it got going for it? It's conductive, but I really doubt the gold sitting in Fort Knox is being used for circuitboards. It's not. It's only there to serve itself and sit around being valuable. And yet our entire world economy, and every system that depends on money, rely entirely on our perception that gold and currency hold value. What would happen if everyone decided to move on from gold? How would society collapse? What would end us first? Would we fight until there were none of us left? Would the collapse of every government bring about famine and disease, which would spread unchecked with no health organizations to stop it? Or would we mostly be fine, since most people are decent at heart? These apocalyptic hypotheticals entertain me, which is probably why I'm so drawn to high-brow intellectual entertainment on the nature of man, like Undertale or Rick and Morty. Stories like those just shake me to my core, with their potent character moments and plot twists, and I really can't understand how people can criticize them. If you can't appreciate the quality storytelling, acting, music, and tone that these tales convey, I'm sorry, but I will not weep for you. At that point, it's a choice you've made to ignore high-class intellectual entertainment. On a lighter note, I do appreciate the resurgence in popularity of Undertale, Megolovania in particular. This is naturally due to the post-launch support the game is receiving, which is unprecedented in scale, quality, and haste among indie games, and games in general. Never, in the history of entertainment, ever, has a piece of media received a second part of the scale or quality Undertale has this quickly, and I don't expect it ever to be topped. The only piece of entertainment media I could see getting the treatment Undertale has is Rick and Morty, because of the intense care and effort put in by the entire creative team, day and night, nonstop, for intellectuals like me. With that said, I really think we should discuss the creative bankruptcy of the television and film industries, since Rick's quest for galactic redemption seems to be at odds with the whims of studio executives. Funding seems to be driving everything dangerously towards what will make a profit rather than what is artistically valuable. Take Illumination studios. They take classic tales like The Grinch and Sing and push out the most unremarkable product they can on the lowest budget reasonable, and then market like they're on borrowed time. You cannot escape the Illumination marketing team. They're everywhere. Your TV, your memes, your aunts, etc. I liked Despicable Me, I thought it was a fine film, Steve Carrell was great, but the marketing for the spinoff made me retroactively hate a movie that used to be a favorite of mine. Hopefully their studio burns down before they finish work on that Shrek reboot, because I cannot stand to see that (Academy Award Winning) series tarnished by such a morally corrupt corporation.",[],,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,,True,t3_cgrjyn,,,,/r/unpopularopinion/comments/cgrjyn/im_so_tired_of_reddits_uncontrollable_need_to_be/eunxlj0/,public,False,,,,,1563934838.0,r/unpopularopinion,0,,,,,,1494698619.0,,False,1572718631.0,[],,

I haven't seen anyone suggest this and I am appalled...his face, height, poses, body proportions, the number of high drama looks he has given us in their limited fashion magazine photoshoots...he could give professional models a run for their money!

**Yoongi:**  Somewhere out in an alternate universe there may be a version of Yoongi where music is not his life but even that seems like an impossibility to me. Yoongi will continue to live and breathe music (singing, rapping, producing, composing, writing lyrics). I hope if has the time maybe even host a radio show. In the future he could definitely start a label of his own or open up a sub-label under Bighit

**Hobi:** He's Bangtan's Golden Hyung for a reason!! I see him rapping, dancing, singing, writing lyrics!! He could also branch out into choreography and he also seems to be interested in touring as a solo artist and I look forward to his eventual collabs with American and Korean artists. I could also see him start a dance academy in the future? 

**Jimin:** Jimin would do really well as a solo artist. With the way he dances and his unique voice I see him being a perfect soloist...I'd love to see him do OSTs and tour extensively (given how much he seems to love  and live for doing concerts). 

**Tae:** V definitely seems like he will go into acting and keep up releasing how own music. He's a lovely baritone and I really love the direction of his music and the kind of music he wants to put out. He'll also probably do a lot of OSTs in the future! And as our resident art boy I could see him continue painting, making art and doing photography and maybe one day even exhibiting them? He could also open a fashion line in the future? And maybe even try out modelling?

**Jungkook:** Jungkook earned the title of 'golden maknae' for a reason. I think he would do amazingly well as a soloist. His voice is so sweet and melodic and combined with his dancing ability I would love to see the direction his solo career takes off in. I also think his voice is amazingly suited for American pop music and I hope he specifically does English collabs too in the future. He's also so young and has time on his side so eventually in the future I see him producing a lot of music. Also lol if he ever decides to open up a Youtube channel of his own I would be the first to subscribe :D

**Jin:** ACTING! ACTING! ACTING! ACTING! ACTING! And I'm gonna say it louder for the people in the back!!! Jin in a romantic comedy, an action thriller, a murder mystery, a detective series, a medical drama, a legal drama, a historical drama, an indie comedy, a zombie movie, a period drama, etc. Jin as a leading man, Jin as a second lead, Jin as an antagonist,villain and other negative roles...I hope he gets to try it all and wins those acting awards! Actor Jin will rise! I also see him singing in OSTs and maybe once in a couple of years a releasing an album of his own self-produced songs. He will definitely branch out into variety but I hope he also considers theatre, voice acting and maybe even film producing (later on in life!).

&gt; Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band formed in Bolton, Greater Manchester, UK in 1976, led by singer-songwriter and guitarist Pete Shelley (1955 – 2018) for nearly their entire existence.

&gt; They are commonly regarded as an important influence on the Manchester music scene, the independent record label movement and the punk rock, power pop, pop punk and indie rock genres in general. They are primarily remembered for their singles, a string of would-be hits that combined a strong grasp of pop song craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy. These singles were collected on Singles Going Steady, described by critic Ned Raggett as a ""punk masterpiece"" The widely covered ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" remains one of their best-known songs.

&gt; The name ""Buzzcocks"" partially comes from the Manchester slang term cock meaning youngster, and its use in the 1970s ITV drama serial Rock Follies which included the catch phrases ""that's the buzz, cocks"" and ""give me a buzz, cock!""

&gt; Buzzcocks were one of the key first generation British punk rock bands to form in the wake of the Sex Pistols in 1976. They were founded by Mancunians Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto, however Devoto left soon after the group released their Spiral Scratch EP (on their own independent label), leaving Shelley to take over vocals. 

&gt; They are best known for their catchy, poppy punk sound, which has been widely influential, which was adopted as Peter Shelley took over on the vocals, singing about what the whole punk rock scene opted not to sing about: love. Devoto in the meanwhile formed Magazine.

&gt; They rehearsed in a friend's kitchen and played at the all-day 100 club punk ""festival"", in London. At the end of 1977 the band signed to United Artists and released ""Orgasm Addict"", with Shelley's high-pitched vocal delivery and Ramones-esque fuzz-guitar sound ensuring the controversial single would be played over again. Later came ""What Do I Get?"" which hit the UK charts and showed Shelley's brilliance in songwriting.

&gt; An LP was then released, Another Music in a Different Kitchen which came with its own carrier bag, labelled ""Product"". In 1978-79 five chart-hitting singles were released including ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" and had captured a pop-loving audience by this time. Love Bites, their second LP was released later on, which had less excitement than the last album, though it did sell well, with Steve Diggle taking over lyric-writing.

&gt; October 1979 saw A Different Kind of Tension which was panned by some critics, quite unfairly, as it contains some excellent songs, the title track being the stand-out. It perhaps suffered from being the second album to be released that year, with the record company keen to capitalise on the band's chart success at the time. 

&gt; 3 more singles followed in 1980, but the spark had clearly gone out for a while. Musical differences and the long slog behind them led to the band splitting in early 1981. Pete Shelley embarked in a solo career.. 

&gt; He released three dance/electronic influenced solo albums: Homosapien, XL1 and Heaven and The Sea - all with the same fine songwriting skills. Meanwhile, Steve Diggle formed Flag of Convenience - a power pop combo -  and toured with some success. 

&gt; A 5 album/CD set was released in 1989 called Product, which contained all the albums to date, plus the greatest hits and B sides album, Singles Going Steady, and the last non-album singles, Why She's A Girl From the Chainstore, Airwaves Dream and Running Free, plus the B sides

&gt; In 1992 the Buzzcocks reformed, without original drummer John Maher and bassist Steve Garvey, and releasd Trade Test Transmissions in 1993, quite different from their earlier material, with nods to the power pop scene popular at the time. All Set in 1996 saw a return to form with familiar riffs and pin sharp lyrics pop-punk. Next year Chronology was released, the missing album, including outtakes from the three United Artists albums.  In 1999 they released Modern, which saw Shelley in reflective mode and Steve Diggle taking over more of the vocal duties.

&gt; Then followed another brief break in 2000, with Shelley teaming up with old band-mate Howard Devoto to release a largely disappointing album, Buzzkunst. Compilations followed, including Inventory in 2003, which contained every single to date, and 30 in 2005 to celebrate 30 years performing

&gt; 2005 saw the Buzzcocks back touring and in 2007 they released the superb Flat Pack Philosophy, widely agreed to rank up with the best of Buzzcocks output

&gt; 2008/9 saw a short tour where the band played tracks from Another Music and Love Bites.

&gt; In August 2011 they headlined the first night of The Rhythm Festival in Bedfordshire.

&gt; In November 2011 it was announced they would be playing two shows in 2012 that would feature the original line-up as well as the classic line-up of the band reunited for the first time in many years; these shows took place on 25 May 2012 in Manchester at the O2 Apollo and on 26 May in Brixton at the O2 Academy. It was announced on 26 May 2012 that, for the first time, they would headline Thursday night in the Empress Ballroom at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool sharing the stage with the likes of Rancid, Public Image Limited and Social Distortion.

&gt; On 1 May 2014 Buzzcocks released the album The Way via PledgeMusic. On 13 September 2014 Buzzcocks played ""a brief but triumphant set"" at Riot Fest 2014 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. In October 2014 Buzzcocks toured the U.K. for three weeks with The Dollyrots as main support.

&gt; In 2016, the band embarked on their 40th-anniversary tour (dubbed ""Buzzcocks 40""). In 2017, ""Why Can't I Touch It"" was featured in the opening segment of the Telltale game 'Guardians of the Galaxy.

&gt; Buzzcocks continue to be a huge influence on many bands and are still enjoyed by a large, and very loyal, fanbase.

&gt; Pete Shelley died on 6 December 2018. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD ""Edgy In Brixton"" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London. The DVD contains a full live performance of the debut album Costello Music, B-Sides from various singles and a new song called Pretty Like a Girl.

About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles.

The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd.

""Seven Nights Seven Days"" was released as a single on September 29th. The album was recorded in Glasgow with Jon Fratelli and Stuart McCredie on production duties.

&gt; On the 24th of April 2013 it was announced that The Fratellis would be headlining Brownstock Festival in Essex on Sunday the 1st of September.

&gt; On the 22nd June 2013 The Fratellis headlined New College Commemoration Ball, a white-tie Ball set in the grounds of New College, Oxford.

I'll answer the first and last questions together:   


I'm taking an MA to essentially give me a lift-up from my previous background (music production) which I have GCSE, A-Level and BA (1:1) qualifications in. It's been difficult to make the transition without having a proper academic lift to my game design skills.   


Being able to network at a London uni for a year, benefiting from a loan (thus not yet having to work long hours part-time in a job that isn't relevant) and attaining the additional skills on offer at said uni (postgrad academy, in which I can take additional courses in a multitude of things, such as programming, 2D art - allows me to further my secondary skills,) sounds like a solid deal for me. I've always benefited from remaining in academics, and I feel doing an MA gives me that little bit of extra time I need to expand my portfolio, network and benefit from alumni networking (and job opportunities/possible placements) thereafter.   


I'm not just relying on the qualification in hopes it'll give me a magical key to all these opportunities ahead. It's the time and opportunities that come with it that I'm riding on. There are no entry-level jobs in game design, so using this time wisely is my key priority here - to get myself closer to actual game design jobs.   


I hear you on the qualification point though - I don't want to potentially misdirect myself, only for it to hurt later.   


As for what game dev is for me - a year and a half ago, it was simply a hobby, but a really great remote job opportunity made me realise that I'd greatly prefer working in the games industry as a designer and generalist, as opposed to a freelance sound engineer and producer. I've got some experience here and there with remote indie game studios on steam titles, but nothing substantial - nothing that indicates this is my career aspiration. I'm wanting to get to that level.

&gt; Floater began in 1993 when Robert Wynia (lead vocals, bass), Peter Cornett (drums), and Dave Amador (guitar), got together in Eugene, Oregon, making their start at garage parties and the U of O beer garden. With compelling lyrics and adept storytelling, their music shifts in mood from the insistent and heavy to the melodic and soulful, comprising the signature sound for which Floater is best known.

&gt; Floater's regional success was noticed by Elemental Records, who put out their first full-length record, ""Sink"" in 1994. That same year Floater began a string of sold out shows at the Community Center for the Performing Arts (The WOW Hall) that is still unbroken to this day.

&gt; In 1995 Floater released ""Glyph"" and toured the country for the next two years supporting the record. The single, ""Danny Boy"" received heavy college and commercial radio play, in many cities outselling major label releases. Floater received nominations to the preliminary level of the Grammy's from NARAS (National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences) in 1995 under Best Rock Performance for ""Sink"" and in 1996 under Best Alternative Performance for ""Glyph."" (Prelims are determined by nominations from the NARAS members).

&gt; In 1998, following their move to Portland, Oregon (where the band currently resides), Floater released their third full-length record, ""Angels in the Flesh and Devils in the Bone."" The second concept album by the band (""Sink"" was the first), ""Angel's"" brought a new vibe to Floater. It wasn't long before widespread audiences came to embrace what has now become the band's trademark - their versatility. 

&gt; September of 2000 brought the release of Floater's fourth full- length record, ""Burning Sosobra""; a musical collection that explores the band's broad range of song writing. Following its release, the band began to perform live acoustically. Both the band and the fans enjoyed this new avenue of performance that allowed the ""quieter"" side of Floater to emerge and be explored. Of late, the band has begun playing shows where acoustic Floater opens for electric Floater - giving a sort of Jekyll and Hyde feel to their performances.

&gt; In 2002 Floater released their most critically acclaimed record to date, ""Alter."" Combining the bands strongest musical elements, ""Alter"" moves fluidly from heavy riffs to lullabies and tells flowing stories of fear, love and above all change.

&gt; August of 2004 - The release of the band's acoustic record, ""Acoustics."" Fans of Floater's electric shows responded with enthusiasm to the band's occasional acoustic performance - with their record label's encouragement, the band put together a uniquely recorded album - one that mimics the sound of their actual performances. Recorded in a studio built in the ballroom of their producers house, the record was made without digital editing and has a fresh, live feeling. 

&gt; Floater is also the name of a late nineties indiepop band from Sheffield, UK. They briefly rename themselves Floater UK before later reforming as Dangerlust. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band formed in Bolton, Greater Manchester, UK in 1976, led by singer-songwriter and guitarist Pete Shelley (1955 – 2018) for nearly their entire existence.

&gt; They are commonly regarded as an important influence on the Manchester music scene, the independent record label movement and the punk rock, power pop, pop punk and indie rock genres in general. They are primarily remembered for their singles, a string of would-be hits that combined a strong grasp of pop song craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy. These singles were collected on Singles Going Steady, described by critic Ned Raggett as a ""punk masterpiece"" The widely covered ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" remains one of their best-known songs.

&gt; The name ""Buzzcocks"" partially comes from the Manchester slang term cock meaning youngster, and its use in the 1970s ITV drama serial Rock Follies which included the catch phrases ""that's the buzz, cocks"" and ""give me a buzz, cock!""

&gt; Buzzcocks were one of the key first generation British punk rock bands to form in the wake of the Sex Pistols in 1976. They were founded by Mancunians Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto, however Devoto left soon after the group released their Spiral Scratch EP (on their own independent label), leaving Shelley to take over vocals. 

&gt; They are best known for their catchy, poppy punk sound, which has been widely influential, which was adopted as Peter Shelley took over on the vocals, singing about what the whole punk rock scene opted not to sing about: love. Devoto in the meanwhile formed Magazine.

&gt; They rehearsed in a friend's kitchen and played at the all-day 100 club punk ""festival"", in London. At the end of 1977 the band signed to United Artists and released ""Orgasm Addict"", with Shelley's high-pitched vocal delivery and Ramones-esque fuzz-guitar sound ensuring the controversial single would be played over again. Later came ""What Do I Get?"" which hit the UK charts and showed Shelley's brilliance in songwriting.

&gt; An LP was then released, Another Music in a Different Kitchen which came with its own carrier bag, labelled ""Product"". In 1978-79 five chart-hitting singles were released including ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" and had captured a pop-loving audience by this time. Love Bites, their second LP was released later on, which had less excitement than the last album, though it did sell well, with Steve Diggle taking over lyric-writing.

&gt; October 1979 saw A Different Kind of Tension which was panned by some critics, quite unfairly, as it contains some excellent songs, the title track being the stand-out. It perhaps suffered from being the second album to be released that year, with the record company keen to capitalise on the band's chart success at the time. 

&gt; 3 more singles followed in 1980, but the spark had clearly gone out for a while. Musical differences and the long slog behind them led to the band splitting in early 1981. Pete Shelley embarked in a solo career.. 

&gt; He released three dance/electronic influenced solo albums: Homosapien, XL1 and Heaven and The Sea - all with the same fine songwriting skills. Meanwhile, Steve Diggle formed Flag of Convenience - a power pop combo -  and toured with some success. 

&gt; A 5 album/CD set was released in 1989 called Product, which contained all the albums to date, plus the greatest hits and B sides album, Singles Going Steady, and the last non-album singles, Why She's A Girl From the Chainstore, Airwaves Dream and Running Free, plus the B sides

&gt; In 1992 the Buzzcocks reformed, without original drummer John Maher and bassist Steve Garvey, and releasd Trade Test Transmissions in 1993, quite different from their earlier material, with nods to the power pop scene popular at the time. All Set in 1996 saw a return to form with familiar riffs and pin sharp lyrics pop-punk. Next year Chronology was released, the missing album, including outtakes from the three United Artists albums.  In 1999 they released Modern, which saw Shelley in reflective mode and Steve Diggle taking over more of the vocal duties.

&gt; Then followed another brief break in 2000, with Shelley teaming up with old band-mate Howard Devoto to release a largely disappointing album, Buzzkunst. Compilations followed, including Inventory in 2003, which contained every single to date, and 30 in 2005 to celebrate 30 years performing

&gt; 2005 saw the Buzzcocks back touring and in 2007 they released the superb Flat Pack Philosophy, widely agreed to rank up with the best of Buzzcocks output

&gt; 2008/9 saw a short tour where the band played tracks from Another Music and Love Bites.

&gt; In August 2011 they headlined the first night of The Rhythm Festival in Bedfordshire.

&gt; In November 2011 it was announced they would be playing two shows in 2012 that would feature the original line-up as well as the classic line-up of the band reunited for the first time in many years; these shows took place on 25 May 2012 in Manchester at the O2 Apollo and on 26 May in Brixton at the O2 Academy. It was announced on 26 May 2012 that, for the first time, they would headline Thursday night in the Empress Ballroom at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool sharing the stage with the likes of Rancid, Public Image Limited and Social Distortion.

&gt; On 1 May 2014 Buzzcocks released the album The Way via PledgeMusic. On 13 September 2014 Buzzcocks played ""a brief but triumphant set"" at Riot Fest 2014 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. In October 2014 Buzzcocks toured the U.K. for three weeks with The Dollyrots as main support.

&gt; In 2016, the band embarked on their 40th-anniversary tour (dubbed ""Buzzcocks 40""). In 2017, ""Why Can't I Touch It"" was featured in the opening segment of the Telltale game 'Guardians of the Galaxy.

&gt; Buzzcocks continue to be a huge influence on many bands and are still enjoyed by a large, and very loyal, fanbase.

I always knew this day would come, but I never knew when. After every post, every comment, I ask myself ""is this the one? Will this be the piece of content to finally move someone to spend five bucks to make my experience on this app slightly better?"" That usually gets me thinking about the unique social dynamic Reddit's premium system fosters. Although most of their profits come from advertisers and their main product is us - the audience- it is interesting that the only product they provide for us to purchase is charity. It makes sense from a business perspective, as any free platform makes most of their money from a select group of high-spending users, their ""Whales"". However, standard premium memberships limit the spending capacity of each whale, since they can't buy themselves two premium memberships on the same account. However, by allowing them to provide that membership and recognition of quality to whatever other user they deem fit, Reddit allows the whales to spend as much as they want and keep the money flowing. This dependency on the altruism of Whales naturally draws some parallels to nature (pun intended). Nature's whales provide food, aid, and transport to all kinds of organisms, from the barnacle to the remora? But they are not essential to their survival. So too do the whales of Reddit help those who don't really need it but sure do appreciate it. Which brings me to my next point: the perceived value of gold and currency's worth in modern society. People often argue that money as a concept is manipulative because of its lack of inherent value, and that we should bring back some form of gold or silver standard. But that also presents a bit of a problem, because gold has no reason to be considered to be considered any more valuable than any other metal. Sure it looks nice, but what else has it got going for it? It's conductive, but I really doubt the gold sitting in Fort Knox is being used for circuitboards. It's not. It's only there to serve itself and sit around being valuable. And yet our entire world economy, and every system that depends on money, rely entirely on our perception that gold and currency hold value. What would happen if everyone decided to move on from gold? How would society collapse? What would end us first? Would we fight until there were none of us left? Would the collapse of every government bring about famine and disease, which would spread unchecked with no health organizations to stop it? Or would we mostly be fine, since most people are decent at heart? These apocalyptic hypotheticals entertain me, which is probably why I'm so drawn to high-brow intellectual entertainment on the nature of man, like Undertale or Rick and Morty. Stories like those just shake me to my core, with their potent character moments and plot twists, and I really can't understand how people can criticize them. If you can't appreciate the quality storytelling, acting, music, and tone that these tales convey, I'm sorry, but I will not weep for you. At that point, it's a choice you've made to ignore high-class intellectual entertainment. On a lighter note, I do appreciate the resurgence in popularity of Undertale, Megolovania in particular. This is naturally due to the post-launch support the game is receiving, which is unprecedented in scale, quality, and haste among indie games, and games in general. Never, in the history of entertainment, ever, has a piece of media received a second part of the scale or quality Undertale has this quickly, and I don't expect it ever to be topped. The only piece of entertainment media I could see getting the treatment Undertale has is Rick and Morty, because of the intense care and effort put in by the entire creative team, day and night, nonstop, for intellectuals like me. With that said, I really think we should discuss the creative bankruptcy of the television and film industries, since Rick's quest for galactic redemption seems to be at odds with the whims of studio executives. Funding seems to be driving everything dangerously towards what will make a profit rather than what is artistically valuable. Take Illumination studios. They take classic tales like The Grinch and Sing and push out the most unremarkable product they can on the lowest budget reasonable, and then market like they're on borrowed time. You cannot escape the Illumination marketing team. They're everywhere. Your TV, your memes, your aunts, etc. I liked Despicable Me, I thought it was a fine film, Steve Carrell was great, but the marketing for the spinoff made me retroactively hate a movie that used to be a favorite of mine. Hopefully their studio burns down before they finish work on that Shrek reboot, because I cannot stand to see that (Academy Award Winning) series tarnished by such a morally corrupt corporation.",[],,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,,True,t3_c44fwv,,,,/r/starterpacks/comments/c44fwv/over_used_comments_on_reddit_starterpack/es230ys/,public,False,,,,,1561512561.0,r/starterpacks,0,,,,,,1494698619.0,,False,1570933230.0,[],,

&gt; Mission of Burma is an American post-punk band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1979. The band was formed by Roger Miller (guitar), Clint Conley (bass), Peter Prescott (drums) and Martin Swope (tape manipulator/sound engineer). Miller, Conley and Prescott share singing and songwriting duties. Like many of their post-punk contemporaries, Mission of Burma's efforts are largely concerned with extending punk's original vocabulary without losing its essential rebellious spirit. Using rapid shifts in dynamics, unconventional time signatures and chord progressions along with tape effects, Mission of Burma challenges the prevailing idioms of punk while attempting to retain its power and immediacy.

&gt; In early years the band's audience was limited to the Boston area, with all their recordings released on the small Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. The band released only one album in its original form, Vs.. Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope, and has since recorded two more albums, ONoffON and The Obliterati.

&gt; Their wall-of-noise musical sound extended the vocabulary of punk while continuing to hold clear its sense of power and abandon.  They used a number of tape effects, different chord progressions, and time shifts to highlight their formal training in music.  Not only that but they are seen now as a highly influential band to both post-punk and experimental music to come after; many bands cite Burma as an inspiration, including Nirvana, Superchunk, Creed, The Grifters, R.E.M. (who regularly covered ""Academy Fight Song"" on their Green tour), Sonic Youth, Throwing Muses, Yo La Tengo, Soul Asylum, Pixies, Sugar, Catherine Wheel, Guided by Voices, Graham Coxon and Moby - the last two of which have covered """"That's When I Reach For My Revolver.""

&gt; The band were due to tour in 1980 with Joy Division but the suicide of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's singer, canceled the tour. In 1983, after releasing their only full-length studio record Vs., the group disbanded due to Miller's worsening tinnitus.

&gt; The band found increasing relevance throughout the 90s, culminating in the publication of Michael Azzerad's essays Our Band Could Be Your Life which featured Mission of Burma. In 2002, they reunited and began playing reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and formerly Prescott's Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller relates that ""when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin's position, we told him he could use current digital technology which accomplishes Martin's antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted for maintaining the original integrity, and uses a tape deck.""

&gt; Floater began in 1993 when Robert Wynia (lead vocals, bass), Peter Cornett (drums), and Dave Amador (guitar), got together in Eugene, Oregon, making their start at garage parties and the U of O beer garden. With compelling lyrics and adept storytelling, their music shifts in mood from the insistent and heavy to the melodic and soulful, comprising the signature sound for which Floater is best known.

&gt; Floater's regional success was noticed by Elemental Records, who put out their first full-length record, ""Sink"" in 1994. That same year Floater began a string of sold out shows at the Community Center for the Performing Arts (The WOW Hall) that is still unbroken to this day.

&gt; In 1995 Floater released ""Glyph"" and toured the country for the next two years supporting the record. The single, ""Danny Boy"" received heavy college and commercial radio play, in many cities outselling major label releases. Floater received nominations to the preliminary level of the Grammy's from NARAS (National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences) in 1995 under Best Rock Performance for ""Sink"" and in 1996 under Best Alternative Performance for ""Glyph."" (Prelims are determined by nominations from the NARAS members).

&gt; In 1998, following their move to Portland, Oregon (where the band currently resides), Floater released their third full-length record, ""Angels in the Flesh and Devils in the Bone."" The second concept album by the band (""Sink"" was the first), ""Angel's"" brought a new vibe to Floater. It wasn't long before widespread audiences came to embrace what has now become the band's trademark - their versatility. 

&gt; September of 2000 brought the release of Floater's fourth full- length record, ""Burning Sosobra""; a musical collection that explores the band's broad range of song writing. Following its release, the band began to perform live acoustically. Both the band and the fans enjoyed this new avenue of performance that allowed the ""quieter"" side of Floater to emerge and be explored. Of late, the band has begun playing shows where acoustic Floater opens for electric Floater - giving a sort of Jekyll and Hyde feel to their performances.

&gt; In 2002 Floater released their most critically acclaimed record to date, ""Alter."" Combining the bands strongest musical elements, ""Alter"" moves fluidly from heavy riffs to lullabies and tells flowing stories of fear, love and above all change.

&gt; August of 2004 - The release of the band's acoustic record, ""Acoustics."" Fans of Floater's electric shows responded with enthusiasm to the band's occasional acoustic performance - with their record label's encouragement, the band put together a uniquely recorded album - one that mimics the sound of their actual performances. Recorded in a studio built in the ballroom of their producers house, the record was made without digital editing and has a fresh, live feeling. 

&gt; Floater is also the name of a late nineties indiepop band from Sheffield, UK. They briefly rename themselves Floater UK before later reforming as Dangerlust. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Emma began her musical journey when she was bought her first guitar at the age of 3, after being enchanted by her Mum’s playing. With Emma always singing and constantly wanting to join in and play too, her parents soon realised music would play a definitive role in her destiny. She began taking lessons in cello and piano, became a member of the Surrey Youth Orchestra and involved herself with numerous music clubs in and out of school. Constantly creating parts on any instrument she could get her hands on, and writing poetry in her bedroom, Emma combined the two and discovered the art of songwriting. Desperate to learn more, Emma enrolled at the Academy of Contemporary music, where she studied Guitar and Performance – this not only improved Emma’s confidence as a performer, but taught her valuable lessons as a songwriter.

&gt; As Emma’s skills on guitar developed, she began playing for artists and bands, including fiN., H- Boogie, and Ronit, this led her to touring worldwide with bands such as The Kooks, Mona, Feeder and Incubus. No stranger to the stage, Emma would often perform at arena style venues to up to 20,000 a night! This gave Emma a great deal of experience and a wonderful foundation from which to launch her solo career.

&gt; When she was discovered by music manager, Bob James – Emma’s songwriting career took off. She found herself working with established artists and songwriters all over the world, frequently making trips to LA, Nashville and Europe. Korean boy band “SHINee” released one of Emma’s songs on their album and it sold 100,000 copies in its first week of release, hitting the number 1 spot.

&gt; With a passion for performing, and longing to release her own music, Emma decided to concentrate on her career as a singer-songwriter. Her music is catchy and filmic, and has been used on TV, clients including BBC and ITV. She has also worked with artists such as Kate Nash, Passenger and Jenn Bostic, who she supported on her recent UK tour.

&gt; When Emma lost her Mum to cancer in 2012, she dealt with it in the only way she knew – through her music and songwriting. Emma planned a series of 4 EPs, each one with a unique and beautiful artwork designed by her Mum. Emma’s Mum made the designs as a gift to Emma, and completed them just two weeks before she died. When all 4 are collected they will fit together like a puzzle to make a larger beautiful painting. This combination of art and music typifies Emma’s unique approach to her work. Playing guitar, piano, cello, ukulele, banjo, mandolin, percussion and baritone guitar, all 4 EPs showcase Emma’s talents as a songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band formed in Bolton, Greater Manchester, UK in 1976, led by singer-songwriter and guitarist Pete Shelley (1955 – 2018) for nearly their entire existence.

&gt; They are commonly regarded as an important influence on the Manchester music scene, the independent record label movement and the punk rock, power pop, pop punk and indie rock genres in general. They are primarily remembered for their singles, a string of would-be hits that combined a strong grasp of pop song craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy. These singles were collected on Singles Going Steady, described by critic Ned Raggett as a ""punk masterpiece"" The widely covered ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" remains one of their best-known songs.

&gt; The name ""Buzzcocks"" partially comes from the Manchester slang term cock meaning youngster, and its use in the 1970s ITV drama serial Rock Follies which included the catch phrases ""that's the buzz, cocks"" and ""give me a buzz, cock!""

&gt; Buzzcocks were one of the key first generation British punk rock bands to form in the wake of the Sex Pistols in 1976. They were founded by Mancunians Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto, however Devoto left soon after the group released their Spiral Scratch EP (on their own independent label), leaving Shelley to take over vocals. 

&gt; They are best known for their catchy, poppy punk sound, which has been widely influential, which was adopted as Peter Shelley took over on the vocals, singing about what the whole punk rock scene opted not to sing about: love. Devoto in the meanwhile formed Magazine.

&gt; They rehearsed in a friend's kitchen and played at the all-day 100 club punk ""festival"", in London. At the end of 1977 the band signed to United Artists and released ""Orgasm Addict"", with Shelley's high-pitched vocal delivery and Ramones-esque fuzz-guitar sound ensuring the controversial single would be played over again. Later came ""What Do I Get?"" which hit the UK charts and showed Shelley's brilliance in songwriting.

&gt; An LP was then released, Another Music in a Different Kitchen which came with its own carrier bag, labelled ""Product"". In 1978-79 five chart-hitting singles were released including ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" and had captured a pop-loving audience by this time. Love Bites, their second LP was released later on, which had less excitement than the last album, though it did sell well, with Steve Diggle taking over lyric-writing.

&gt; October 1979 saw A Different Kind of Tension which was panned by some critics, quite unfairly, as it contains some excellent songs, the title track being the stand-out. It perhaps suffered from being the second album to be released that year, with the record company keen to capitalise on the band's chart success at the time. 

&gt; 3 more singles followed in 1980, but the spark had clearly gone out for a while. Musical differences and the long slog behind them led to the band splitting in early 1981. Pete Shelley embarked in a solo career.. 

&gt; He released three dance/electronic influenced solo albums: Homosapien, XL1 and Heaven and The Sea - all with the same fine songwriting skills. Meanwhile, Steve Diggle formed Flag of Convenience - a power pop combo -  and toured with some success. 

&gt; A 5 album/CD set was released in 1989 called Product, which contained all the albums to date, plus the greatest hits and B sides album, Singles Going Steady, and the last non-album singles, Why She's A Girl From the Chainstore, Airwaves Dream and Running Free, plus the B sides

&gt; In 1992 the Buzzcocks reformed, without original drummer John Maher and bassist Steve Garvey, and releasd Trade Test Transmissions in 1993, quite different from their earlier material, with nods to the power pop scene popular at the time. All Set in 1996 saw a return to form with familiar riffs and pin sharp lyrics pop-punk. Next year Chronology was released, the missing album, including outtakes from the three United Artists albums.  In 1999 they released Modern, which saw Shelley in reflective mode and Steve Diggle taking over more of the vocal duties.

&gt; Then followed another brief break in 2000, with Shelley teaming up with old band-mate Howard Devoto to release a largely disappointing album, Buzzkunst. Compilations followed, including Inventory in 2003, which contained every single to date, and 30 in 2005 to celebrate 30 years performing

&gt; 2005 saw the Buzzcocks back touring and in 2007 they released the superb Flat Pack Philosophy, widely agreed to rank up with the best of Buzzcocks output

&gt; 2008/9 saw a short tour where the band played tracks from Another Music and Love Bites.

&gt; In August 2011 they headlined the first night of The Rhythm Festival in Bedfordshire.

&gt; In November 2011 it was announced they would be playing two shows in 2012 that would feature the original line-up as well as the classic line-up of the band reunited for the first time in many years; these shows took place on 25 May 2012 in Manchester at the O2 Apollo and on 26 May in Brixton at the O2 Academy. It was announced on 26 May 2012 that, for the first time, they would headline Thursday night in the Empress Ballroom at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool sharing the stage with the likes of Rancid, Public Image Limited and Social Distortion.

&gt; On 1 May 2014 Buzzcocks released the album The Way via PledgeMusic. On 13 September 2014 Buzzcocks played ""a brief but triumphant set"" at Riot Fest 2014 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. In October 2014 Buzzcocks toured the U.K. for three weeks with The Dollyrots as main support.

&gt; In 2016, the band embarked on their 40th-anniversary tour (dubbed ""Buzzcocks 40""). In 2017, ""Why Can't I Touch It"" was featured in the opening segment of the Telltale game 'Guardians of the Galaxy.

&gt; Buzzcocks continue to be a huge influence on many bands and are still enjoyed by a large, and very loyal, fanbase.

&gt; Pete Shelley died on 6 December 2018. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Cass McCombs (born in Concord, California in 1977) is an American singer-songwriter and performer.

&gt; An enigmatic folk nomad, McCombs is a quintessentially American artist; ""he's quietly become one of (the country's) finest chroniclers of fringe characters, a writer of heart-rending love songs and psychedelic odes to the natural world, a teller of tall-tales with a sense of humor dry as desert wood, and that rare folksinger who actually sings about the folk."" His vocals range somewhere between the anxious drone of Lou Reed, the hollow croon of Elliott Smith, the lilting melody of Morrissey, and the driving earnestness and complexity of bards such as Leonard Cohen or Bob Dylan. His lyrical style is alternately vivid and weary, laconic and yearning, or drifting into the high-spirited and whimsical.

&gt; After cutting his first EP, Not the Way in San Francisco in 2001, McCombs relocated to Baltimore, MD. There he released ""Not the Way"" in 2002 and recorded his first full-length, A, in 2003 on Monitor Records. He spent the next few years touring: playing All Tomorrow's Parties; and opening for bands such as Modest Mouse, The Decemberists, and Belle and Sebastian; before recording his second LP PREfection, which was released on 4AD in 2005. 

&gt; McCombs' subsequent releases have been on the highly successful British independent label Domino Recording Co. 2007's Dropping the Writ was named one of Amazon's Best Albums of that year. Catacombs was voted one of the 50 greatest albums of 2009 by Pitchfork Media, and features Academy Award-nominated actress and singer Karen Black on the track Dreams-Come-True-Girl. During this period, McCombs toured with the likes of Arcade Fire, Andrew Bird, Band of Horses, José González, Beach House, and The Walkmen.

&gt; Catacombs also established McCombs' relationship with engineer/producer Ariel Rechtshaid, member of The Hippos and Foreign Born, who produced Grammy-winning hit Climax for Usher, the Plain White T's Grammy-nominated No.1 platinum-selling single Hey There Delilah, and albums for Vampire Weekend, Sky Ferreira, Snoop Lion, and Haim, among others.

&gt; In 2010 McCombs played Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago, L.A.'s Culture Collide Festival and Invisible Children Benefit. 2011 offered an extensive headlining tour, an appearance at SXSW, and two albums released by McCombs and produced by Rechtshaid: Wit's End in April and Humor Risk in November. The two albums were made simultaneously. In an interview with Pitchfork, McCombs explains: ""Wit's End was started years ago and it slowly made its way to the finish line. Humor Risk was just punched out. They're friends but they're different. Wit's End is like a stew; Humor Risk is the raw food diet.""

&gt; Big Wheel and Others, McCombs' seventh full-length (and first double album) was released in October 2013. The album is rooted in the Americana mythos of the Wild West, from the San Francisco drug culture to the gunslingers and gold rush of the nineteenth century. The album once again features Karen Black on a version of the track Brighter!, her final recording before passing away due to ampullary cancer in August, 2013. Big Wheel is dedicated to her memory.

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD ""Edgy In Brixton"" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London. The DVD contains a full live performance of the debut album Costello Music, B-Sides from various singles and a new song called Pretty Like a Girl. Extras on the DVD include the band being asked questions by members of The Fratellis' website, and on the deluxe edition, highlights from the T In The Park 2007 festival. It was released in the United States on the 30 October 2007

&gt; 2007-2008: Here We Stand

&gt; On November 20, 2007, it was announced on the Fratellis' official website that work had begun on the second album in rehearsal space in Glasgow. The band stated that they are self-producing the album and have their own studio to record in. Recording finished on January 13, 2008.

&gt; On February 22, 2008, they played a small show for fans at Queen Margaret Union to debut new songs from the upcoming album. About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. The first single from the album was called ""Mistress Mabel"" and was released on May 26, 2008. The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd. The Fratellis released a deluxe edition of Here We Stand internationally on December the 8th. The CD includes a new song titled 'Moriarty's Last Stand' and the accompanying DVD includes ""The Year Of The Thief"" (A documentary of the band on the road in the US); A live show filmed on June 18th 2008 at the Fillmore, San Francisco; performances of Milk and Money, Flathead and Mistress Mabel from Abbey Road Studios and the videos for the singles Mistress Mabel and Look Out Sunshine!
On April, 22 2010, both singer Jon Lawler and bassist Barry Wallace posted messages on their forum saying the band are unlikely to record together again soon.

&gt; The Fratellis have announced during June 2012 that they have decided to reform to help raise money for The Eilidh Brown Memorial Fund on the 15th of June at the MacRobert Centre in Stirling. The band plans on announcing more dates for later in the year.

**Directed by Jason Orley. Starring Pete Davidson and Griffin Gluck.**

[**Triple Frontier**](https://letterboxd.com/film/triple-frontier/)

The cast for this Netflix action thriller is awesome. If the trailer and director is anything to go by though, this looks really promising.

**Directed by J.C. Chandor (Margin Call). Starring Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnam and Pedro Pascal.**

[**Chaos Walking**](https://letterboxd.com/film/chaos-walking/)

I hope this is amazing, but the premise sounds incredibly difficult to pull off. Good cast and director, so fingers crossed. I'm using the book description here.

&gt;A dystopian world where all living creatures can hear each other's thoughts in a stream of images, words, and sounds called Noise.

**Directed by Doug Liman (Edge of Tomorrow). Starring Tom Holland and Daisy Ridley.**

**Directed by Ben Taylor. Starring Ryan Reynolds.**

[**The Beach Bum**](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-bea&gt;ch-bum/)

&amp;#x200B;

[**The Nightingale**](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-nightingale-2018/)

The second film from the director of the Babadook. Really promising (and slightly divisive) reviews out of Sundance. Fun fact: you can kinda measure the divisiveness of a film on RT by comparing the percentage meter with the average rating. [If the percentage is high but the average rating is low](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/american_made_2017/), it shows that the film is all-round solid and inoffensive. If the [percentage rating is lower but the average rating is still high/moderate](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mother_2017), it means there’s a large gap between those who loved and didn’t like it. Anyway, back to the Nightingale. I’m excited - doubly so since it’s an Aussie film.

&gt;In 1829, Claire, a 21-year-old Irish convict, chases a British soldier through the rugged Tasmanian wilderness, bent on revenge for a terrible act of violence he committed against her family. She enlists the services of an Aboriginal tracker named Billy, who is also marked by trauma from his own violence-filled past.

Another awesome cast, definitely one to look forward to. The plot summary isn’t out, but it’s a comedy zombie flick.

**Directed by Jim Jarmusch.  Starring Bill Murray, Adam Driver, Selena Gomez, Chloë Sevigny, Austin Butler, Steve Buscemi and Tilda Swinton.**

&amp;#x200B;

[**Memoria**](https://letterboxd.com/film/memoria-1/)

Tilda Swinton seems to be working a lot, woah.

&gt;Memoria revolves around a character (portrayed by Tilda Swinton) who suffers from exploding head syndrome, a psychological condition in which a person experiences loud noises when falling asleep or waking up.

**Directed by Apichatpong Weerasethakul.  Starring Tilda Swinton and Jeanne Balibar.**

&amp;#x200B;

[**Where'd You Go, Bernadette**](https://letterboxd.com/film/whered-you-go-bernadette/)

The trailer for this, particularly the music, wasn’t good. The content of the trailer shows a lot of potential though, and the book is apparently really good. Also: Richard Linklater.

&gt;When architect-turned-recluse Bernadette Fox goes missing prior to a family trip to Antarctica, her 15-year-old daughter Bee goes on a quest with Bernadette’s husband to find her.

[**The Cradle**](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-cradle-3/)

I don’t know much about this one but the plot intrigues me. For some reason it reminds me of Denis Villeneuve's early film, Incendies (if you haven’t watched yet, make it your next film - it’s incredible.)

&gt;A young couple not ready to expect their first baby track down a cradle, only to make a discovery that will change their family forever.

[**The Woman in the Window**](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-woman-in-the-window-2019/)

A Rear Window-esque movie with a great cast and director. Really hoping this is great, cos I love these kind of plots.

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

&gt; Cass McCombs (born in Concord, California in 1977) is an American singer-songwriter and performer.

&gt; An enigmatic folk nomad, McCombs is a quintessentially American artist; ""he's quietly become one of (the country's) finest chroniclers of fringe characters, a writer of heart-rending love songs and psychedelic odes to the natural world, a teller of tall-tales with a sense of humor dry as desert wood, and that rare folksinger who actually sings about the folk."" His vocals range somewhere between the anxious drone of Lou Reed, the hollow croon of Elliott Smith, the lilting melody of Morrissey, and the driving earnestness and complexity of bards such as Leonard Cohen or Bob Dylan. His lyrical style is alternately vivid and weary, laconic and yearning, or drifting into the high-spirited and whimsical.

&gt; After cutting his first EP, Not the Way in San Francisco in 2001, McCombs relocated to Baltimore, MD. There he released ""Not the Way"" in 2002 and recorded his first full-length, A, in 2003 on Monitor Records. He spent the next few years touring: playing All Tomorrow's Parties; and opening for bands such as Modest Mouse, The Decemberists, and Belle and Sebastian; before recording his second LP PREfection, which was released on 4AD in 2005. 

&gt; McCombs' subsequent releases have been on the highly successful British independent label Domino Recording Co. 2007's Dropping the Writ was named one of Amazon's Best Albums of that year. Catacombs was voted one of the 50 greatest albums of 2009 by Pitchfork Media, and features Academy Award-nominated actress and singer Karen Black on the track Dreams-Come-True-Girl. During this period, McCombs toured with the likes of Arcade Fire, Andrew Bird, Band of Horses, José González, Beach House, and The Walkmen.

&gt; Catacombs also established McCombs' relationship with engineer/producer Ariel Rechtshaid, member of The Hippos and Foreign Born, who produced Grammy-winning hit Climax for Usher, the Plain White T's Grammy-nominated No.1 platinum-selling single Hey There Delilah, and albums for Vampire Weekend, Sky Ferreira, Snoop Lion, and Haim, among others.

&gt; In 2010 McCombs played Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago, L.A.'s Culture Collide Festival and Invisible Children Benefit. 2011 offered an extensive headlining tour, an appearance at SXSW, and two albums released by McCombs and produced by Rechtshaid: Wit's End in April and Humor Risk in November. The two albums were made simultaneously. In an interview with Pitchfork, McCombs explains: ""Wit's End was started years ago and it slowly made its way to the finish line. Humor Risk was just punched out. They're friends but they're different. Wit's End is like a stew; Humor Risk is the raw food diet.""

&gt; Big Wheel and Others, McCombs' seventh full-length (and first double album) was released in October 2013. The album is rooted in the Americana mythos of the Wild West, from the San Francisco drug culture to the gunslingers and gold rush of the nineteenth century. The album once again features Karen Black on a version of the track Brighter!, her final recording before passing away due to ampullary cancer in August, 2013. Big Wheel is dedicated to her memory.

The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD ""Edgy In Brixton"" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US.

&gt; British-born Carina Round is a singer-songwriter whom has earned tremendous accolades from fans, critics and the artistic community alike for both her distinctive, yet versatile vocal style and gut wrenchingly honest songwriting.

&gt; Her critically acclaimed performances are nothing short of spectacular. She runs the gamut from “howling siren” to the performer of ethereal confessional tales, disbanding all concepts of musical tags. It is no wonder she has shared stages with an array of diverse artists such as Annie Lennox, Billy Corgan, Maynard James Keenan, Ryan Adams, Elbow, The Gutter Twins, Snow Patrol, Miles Hunt (The Wonder Stuff), Mark Eitzel, and the legendary James Brown. 

&gt; Growing up in Wolverhampton, England, Carina, starting from a very young age, always had an affinity towards music and began to follow her musical dreams. Never losing sight of her goals, her determination and passion led to the recording of her first album The First Blood Mystery (2001). Shaped in the erratic but gripping sounds, her love of legends Patti Smith and Jeff Buckley resonates undeniably. 

&gt; The follow-up and Interscope re-released debut album: The Disconnection (2004) took those influences into much more powerful and personal realms. It landed Carina worldwide exposure in the process, which ultimately brought her career to Los Angeles, California. The relocation proved worthwhile. For Slow Motion Addict (2007), Carina teamed up with notable producer Glen Ballard to create a bewitching and seductive new album. Accompanying the release was a 12-part episodic series that cleverly coincided with each track, creating a visual story for the album. It gave Carina another medium to showcase her artistic ability by acting and starring as the troubled lead character, Maisie Scarlett. 

&gt; Two years later, Carina self-released the EP Things You Should Know in 2009 that resulted in more critical success, having multiple film &amp; TV shows feature her music as well as multiple radio stations, including KCRW, champion her music. Opportunities came flooding in to work with other artists Carina has admired over the years. 

&gt; Since 2009 she is also a member of the band Puscifer, the Solo-Project of Tool- and A Perfect Circle-Vocalist Maynard James Keenan, contributing the female and 2nd voice in live shows and on albums of the band. She also sang vocals on The Twilight Singers new album ‘Dynamite Steps’ along with other artists Nick McCabe (The Verve), Mark Lanegan, and Ani DiFranco, among others. In addition to this, Carina moved into the world of composing and writing for film, working with the award winning film composers John Debney and Glen Ballard on a song that was composed for the film Valentine’s Day, writing with Academy Award winner Marco Beltrami, as well as various others. 

&gt; In one of Carina’s co-writing sessions for film &amp; TV, a band was created called Early Winters with EMI Canadian artist Justin Rutledge, L.A. producer/musician Dan Burns and multi-instrumentalist Zac Rae. The band is an indie rock band with touches of country and folk flare, which draw comparisons to Neko Case and the Swell Season. 

&gt; All of these projects were an inspirational stepping stone for Carina to completing her newest album Tigermending which was released May 1st 2012 through her label Dehisce. On the new track ‘Got To Go (The L.A Song) features Smashing Pumpkins’ front man Billy Corgan playing guitar and she co-wrote the haunting track ‘The Secret of Drowning’ with the legendary Dave Stewart and Brian Eno.

&gt; Comparisons are frequently drawn to PJ Harvey, though Round would contend that she is more directly influenced by Patti Smith.

I used to do piano competitions as a teenager, and I quit after one particularly bad experience with a pretentious judge at a music school who talked down to me as soon as I entered the room, and gave me a bad rating. Apparently I added too much romantic flair to a Beethoven sonata, which is not ""acceptable"" for his era. I wasn't enjoying making music anymore, which to me defeated the whole purpose. I know there are plenty of artists who have had the same experience. Tori Amos was kicked out of the Peabody Institute for refusing to play how she was instructed. Elton John went to the Royal Academy of Music and according to his own admission, skipped classes. The real tragedy is how they both attended these schools only because they won junior scholarships for being musical geniuses, and then the 'gatekeepers of music' held the rules over their heads. It's fortunate that both of them ""made it"" despite being rogues, but sad to think of how many others didn't make it, and we will never hear their art. Musical instruments (e.g. violins) are really expensive, not to mention the lessons, and you pay dearly with the time it takes to practice, compose, and perform, so a financial cushion from a young age is a bonus. I appreciate anyone who is trying to bridge that gap, because music is beautiful and it belongs to everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, the National isn't preventing anyone else from being successful, post-punk or ""authentic"" or whatever the argument is. They are on an indie label, and don't hog any radio air time or media coverage.

After every post, every comment, I ask myself ""is this the one? Will this be the piece of content to finally move someone to spend five bucks to make my experience on this app slightly better?"" That usually gets me thinking about the unique social dynamic Reddit's premium system fosters. Although most of their profits come from advertisers and their main product is us - the audience- it is interesting that the only product they provide for us to purchase is charity. It makes sense from a business perspective, as any free platform makes most of their money from a select group of high-spending users, their ""Whales"". However, standard premium memberships limit the spending capacity of each whale, since they can't buy themselves two premium memberships on the same account. However, by allowing them to provide that membership and recognition of quality to whatever other user they deem fit, Reddit allows the whales to spend as much as they want and keep the money flowing. This dependency on the altruism of Whales naturally draws some parallels to nature (pun intended). Nature's whales provide food, aid, and transport to all kinds of organisms, from the barnacle to the remora? But they are not essential to their survival. So too do the whales of Reddit help those who don't really need it but sure do appreciate it. Which brings me to my next point: the perceived value of gold and currency's worth in modern society. People often argue that money as a concept is manipulative because of its lack of inherent value, and that we should bring back some form of gold or silver standard. But that also presents a bit of a problem, because gold has no reason to be considered to be considered any more valuable than any other metal. Sure it looks nice, but what else has it got going for it? It's conductive, but I really doubt the gold sitting in Fort Knox is being used for circuitboards. It's not. It's only there to serve itself and sit around being valuable. And yet our entire world economy, and every system that depends on money, rely entirely on our perception that gold and currency hold value. What would happen if everyone decided to move on from gold? How would society collapse? What would end us first? Would we fight until there were none of us left? Would the collapse of every government bring about famine and disease, which would spread unchecked with no health organizations to stop it? Or would we mostly be fine, since most people are decent at heart? These apocalyptic hypotheticals entertain me, which is probably why I'm so drawn to high-brow intellectual entertainment on the nature of man, like Undertale or Rick and Morty. Stories like those just shake me to my core, with their potent character moments and plot twists, and I really can't understand how people can criticize them. If you can't appreciate the quality storytelling, acting, music, and tone that these tales convey, I'm sorry, but I will not weep for you. At that point, it's a choice you've made to ignore high-class intellectual entertainment. On a lighter note, I do appreciate the resurgence in popularity of Undertale, Megolovania in particular. This is naturally due to the post-launch support the game is receiving, which is unprecedented in scale, quality, and haste among indie games, and games in general. Never, in the history of entertainment, ever, has a piece of media received a second part of the scale or quality Undertale has this quickly, and I don't expect it ever to be topped. The only piece of entertainment media I could see getting the treatment Undertale has is Rick and Morty, because of the intense care and effort put in by the entire creative team, day and night, nonstop, for intellectuals like me. With that said, I really think we should discuss the creative bankruptcy of the television and film industries, since Rick's quest for galactic redemption seems to be at odds with the whims of studio executives. Funding seems to be driving everything dangerously towards what will make a profit rather than what is artistically valuable. Take Illumination studios. They take classic tales like The Grinch and Sing and push out the most unremarkable product they can on the lowest budget reasonable, and then market like they're on borrowed time. You cannot escape the Illumination marketing team. They're everywhere. Your TV, your memes, your aunts, etc. I liked Despicable Me, I thought it was a fine film, Steve Carrell was great, but the marketing for the spinoff made me retroactively hate a movie that used to be a favorite of mine. Hopefully their studio burns down before they finish work on that Shrek reboot, because I cannot stand to see that (Academy Award Winning) series tarnished by such a morally corrupt corporation.",,,,,False,False,[],True,,{},,,False,,True,t3_bk4phc,,,,/r/Eminem/comments/bk4phc/big_bills/eme18zp/,public,False,,,,,1556866374.0,r/Eminem,0,,,,,,1358294088.0,,False,1561454825.0,,,

**Directed by Grant Sputore.  Starring Hillary Swank , Clara Rugaard-Larsen and Rose Byrne.**

&amp;#x200B;

[**Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile**](https://letterboxd.com/film/extremely-wicked-shockingly-evil-and-vile/)

You’ve more than likely heard of this one. Ted Bundy film starring Zac Efron. I’m not sure how excited I am for the film, but Efron’s performance is apparently very good.

&gt;A chronicle of the crimes of Ted Bundy, from the perspective of his longtime girlfriend, Elizabeth Kloepfer, who refused to believe the truth about him for years.

**Directed by Joe Berlinger.  Starring** **Lily Collins**, **Zac Efron** **and** **John Malkovich**.

&amp;#x200B;

[**The Nightingale**](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-nightingale-2018/)

The second film from the director of the Babadook. Really promising (and slightly divisive) reviews out of Sundance. Fun fact: you can kinda measure the divisiveness of a film on RT by comparing the percentage meter with the average rating. [If the percentage is high but the average rating is low](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/american_made_2017/), it shows that the film is all-round solid and inoffensive. If the [percentage rating is lower but the average rating is still high/moderate](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mother_2017), it means there’s a large gap between those who loved and didn’t like it. Anyway, back to the Nightingale. I’m excited - doubly so since it’s an Aussie film.

&gt;In 1829, Claire, a 21-year-old Irish convict, chases a British soldier through the rugged Tasmanian wilderness, bent on revenge for a terrible act of violence he committed against her family. She enlists the services of an Aboriginal tracker named Billy, who is also marked by trauma from his own violence-filled past.

**Directed by Jennifer Kent.  Starring Aisling Franciosi, Sam Claflin, Damon Herriman and Ewen Leslie.**

&amp;#x200B;

[**The Dead Don't Die**](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-dead-dont-die-2019/)

Another awesome cast, definitely one to look forward to. The plot summary isn’t out, but it’s a comedy zombie flick.

**Directed by Jim Jarmusch.  Starring Bill Murray, Adam Driver, Selena Gomez, Chloë Sevigny, Austin Butler, Steve Buscemi and Tilda Swinton.**

&amp;#x200B;

[**Memoria**](https://letterboxd.com/film/memoria-1/)

Tilda Swinton seems to be working a lot, woah.

&gt;Memoria revolves around a character (portrayed by Tilda Swinton) who suffers from exploding head syndrome, a psychological condition in which a person experiences loud noises when falling asleep or waking up.

**Directed by Apichatpong Weerasethakul.  Starring Tilda Swinton and Jeanne Balibar.**

&amp;#x200B;

[**Where'd You Go, Bernadette**](https://letterboxd.com/film/whered-you-go-bernadette/)

The trailer for this, particularly the music, wasn’t good. The content of the trailer shows a lot of potential though, and the book is apparently really good. Also: Richard Linklater.

&gt;When architect-turned-recluse Bernadette Fox goes missing prior to a family trip to Antarctica, her 15-year-old daughter Bee goes on a quest with Bernadette’s husband to find her.

**Directed by Richard Linklater. Starring Cate Blanchett ,Emma Nelson, Billy Crudup, Kristen Wiig, Judy Greer and Laurence Fishburne.**

&amp;#x200B;

[**A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood**](https://letterboxd.com/film/a-beautiful-day-in-the-neighborhood/)

Tom Hanks seems made for this role. Should be good.

&gt;The story of Fred Rogers, the honored host and creator of the popular children’s television program, Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood (1968).

**Directed by Marielle Heller. Starring Tom Hanks, Matthew Rhys and Chris Cooper.**

&amp;#x200B;

[**High Flying Bird**](https://letterboxd.com/film/high-flying-bird/)

I’ll make this quick: Excellent reviews so far. Netflix in Feb. Steven Soderbergh. Shot on an iPhone. Moonlight writer.

&gt;During an NBA lockout, a sports agent, Dean, presents his rookie client, Erick Scott, with an intriguing and controversial business opportunity.

**Directed by Steven Soderbergh (Ocean’s 11). Starring André Holland Zazie Beetz Jeryl Prescott Kyle MacLachlan Caleb McLaughlin Zachary Quinto.**

&amp;#x200B;

[**The Cradle**](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-cradle-3/)

I don’t know much about this one but the plot intrigues me. For some reason it reminds me of Denis Villeneuve's early film, Incendies (if you haven’t watched yet, make it your next film - it’s incredible.)

&gt;A young couple not ready to expect their first baby track down a cradle, only to make a discovery that will change their family forever.

**Directed by Hope Dickson Leach. Starring Jack O'Connell and Lily Collins.**

&amp;#x200B;

[**The Woman in the Window**](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-woman-in-the-window-2019/)

A Rear Window-esque movie with a great cast and director. Really hoping this is great, cos I love these kind of plots.

&gt;An agoraphobic woman living alone in New York begins spying on her new neighbors only to witness a disturbing act of violence.

**Directed by Joe Wright. Starring Amy Adams, Gary Oldman, Julianne Moore and Wyatt Russell.**",,,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,,True,t3_bj3icc,,,,/r/movies/comments/bj3icc/too_many_superhero_video_game_adaptations_and/em558bd/,public,False,,,,,1556636708.0,r/movies,0,,,,,,1340952931.0,,False,1559368341.0,,,

Wiww this be the piece of content to finawwy move someone to spend five bucks to make my expewience on this app swightwy bettew?"" That usuawwy gets me thinking about the unique sociaw dynamic Weddit's pwemium system fostews. Awthough most of theiw pwofits come fwom advewtisews and theiw main pwoduct is us - the audience- it is intewesting that the onwy pwoduct they pwovide fow us to puwchase is chawity. It makes sense fwom a business pewspective, as any fwee pwatfowm makes most of theiw money fwom a sewect gwoup of high-spending usews, theiw ""Whawes"". Howevew, standawd pwemium membewships wimit the spending capacity of each whawe, since they can't buy themsewves two pwemium membewships on the same account. Howevew, by awwowing them to pwovide that membewship and wecognition of quawity to whatevew othew usew they deem fit, Weddit awwows the whawes to spend as much as they want and keep the money fwowing. This dependency on the awtwuism of Whawes natuwawwy dwaws some pawawwews to natuwe (pun intended). Natuwe's whawes pwovide food, aid, and twanspowt to aww kinds of owganisms, fwom the bawnacwe to the wemowa? But they awe not essentiaw to theiw suwvivaw. So too do the whawes of Weddit hewp those who don't weawwy need it but suwe do appweciate it. Which bwings me to my next point: the pewceived vawue of gowd and cuwwency's wowth in modewn society. Peopwe often awgue that money as a concept is manipuwative because of its wack of inhewent vawue, and that we shouwd bwing back some fowm of gowd ow siwvew standawd.

At that point, it's a choice you've made to ignowe high-cwass intewwectuaw entewtainment. On a wightew note, I do appweciate the wesuwgence in popuwawity of Undewtawe, Megowovania in pawticuwaw.

*post gets gold*

EDIT: Thank you kind stranger! I always knew this day would come, but I never knew when. After every post, every comment, I ask myself ""is this the one? Will this be the piece of content to finally move someone to spend five bucks to make my experience on this app slightly better?"" That usually gets me thinking about the unique social dynamic Reddit's premium system fosters. Although most of their profits come from advertisers and their main product is us - the audience- it is interesting that the only product they provide for us to purchase is charity. It makes sense from a business perspective, as any free platform makes most of their money from a select group of high-spending users, their ""Whales"". However, standard premium memberships limit the spending capacity of each whale, since they can't buy themselves two premium memberships on the same account. However, by allowing them to provide that membership and recognition of quality to whatever other user they deem fit, Reddit allows the whales to spend as much as they want and keep the money flowing. This dependency on the altruism of Whales naturally draws some parallels to nature (pun intended). Nature's whales provide food, aid, and transport to all kinds of organisms, from the barnacle to the remora? But they are not essential to their survival. So too do the whales of Reddit help those who don't really need it but sure do appreciate it. Which brings me to my next point: the perceived value of gold and currency's worth in modern society. People often argue that money as a concept is manipulative because of its lack of inherent value, and that we should bring back some form of gold or silver standard. But that also presents a bit of a problem, because gold has no reason to be considered to be considered any more valuable than any other metal. Sure it looks nice, but what else has it got going for it? It's conductive, but I really doubt the gold sitting in Fort Knox is being used for circuitboards. It's not. It's only there to serve itself and sit around being valuable. And yet our entire world economy, and every system that depends on money, rely entirely on our perception that gold and currency hold value. What would happen if everyone decided to move on from gold? How would society collapse? What would end us first? Would we fight until there were none of us left? Would the collapse of every government bring about famine and disease, which would spread unchecked with no health organizations to stop it? Or would we mostly be fine, since most people are decent at heart? These apocalyptic hypotheticals entertain me, which is probably why I'm so drawn to high-brow intellectual entertainment on the nature of man, like Undertale or Rick and Morty. Stories like those just shake me to my core, with their potent character moments and plot twists, and I really can't understand how people can criticize them. If you can't appreciate the quality storytelling, acting, music, and tone that these tales convey, I'm sorry, but I will not weep for you. At that point, it's a choice you've made to ignore high-class intellectual entertainment. On a lighter note, I do appreciate the resurgence in popularity of Undertale, Megolovania in particular. This is naturally due to the post-launch support the game is receiving, which is unprecedented in scale, quality, and haste among indie games, and games in general. Never, in the history of entertainment, ever, has a piece of media received a second part of the scale or quality Undertale has this quickly, and I don't expect it ever to be topped. The only piece of entertainment media I could see getting the treatment Undertale has is Rick and Morty, because of the intense care and effort put in by the entire creative team, day and night, nonstop, for intellectuals like me. With that said, I really think we should discuss the creative bankruptcy of the television and film industries, since Rick's quest for galactic redemption seems to be at odds with the whims of studio executives. Funding seems to be driving everything dangerously towards what will make a profit rather than what is artistically valuable. Take Illumination studios. They take classic tales like The Grinch and Sing and push out the most unremarkable product they can on the lowest budget reasonable, and then market like they're on borrowed time. You cannot escape the Illumination marketing team. They're everywhere. Your TV, your memes, your aunts, etc. I liked Despicable Me, I thought it was a fine film, Steve Carrell was great, but the marketing for the spinoff made me retroactively hate a movie that used to be a favorite of mine. Hopefully their studio burns down before they finish work on that Shrek reboot, because I cannot stand to see that (Academy Award Winning) series tarnished by such a morally corrupt corporation.",,,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,,True,t3_bhdw4j,,dark,,/r/copypasta/comments/bhdw4j/credit_to_udrfjgjbu_for_this_masterpiece/els0qry/,public,False,,,Reposts copypasta for mobile users,,1556226355.0,r/copypasta,0,,,,,,1468514979.0,,False,1559129195.0,,,

Friday, June 21 - Nicole Atkins: An indie singer-songwriter whose smoky sound shows classic rock and soul influences.

I was constantly introduced to new stuff all the time so I just kinda have a thing for all genres. I mostly listen to rap and chill indie pop because most of the songs have lyrics I can relate to in different ways.

Instruments: Piano, drums, guitar, electric guitar, bass and I’m currently trying to learn cello. Idk of music production and singing counts but if it does then yeah..there’s that. 

Favorite musician of all time: huh wow hard question. Again I Listen to so much different music all the time I have a favorite artist in every genre. Here’s some of em: BROCKHAMPTON, John Lennon, EDEN, Beethoven, Mozart, Elton John (and so much more IM SORRY I CAN PICK ONE)

Classical: Chopin, Mozart and Beethoven. 
I have heard lots about Bach, I’ll try someday to just sit down and listen to some of his work. 

Music school: I am aiming for the school called AMB (Academy of music and business) it’s an English name but still in Sweden. It’s about 40 minutes away where I live so if I get a place there I will be living in dorms. It’s called a gymnasium in Sweden but i guess it’s 11th grade in USA/UK

Oh wow that’s really cool. I think there’s lots of great music schools here in Europe. I hope it goes well for you.

&gt; Glen Hansard (born 21 April 1970) is an Irish singer-songwriter and actor. He is vocalist and guitarist for Irish group  The Frames and one half of folk-rock duo The Swell Season.

&gt; Hansard is said to have quit school at age 13 to begin busking on local Dublin streets. He first came to public attention as guitar player 'Outspan Foster' in the Alan Parker film The Commitments, a role he subsequently regretted, believing it distracted from his music career. In 2003 he presented the first series of Other Voices: Songs from a Room, which showcased Irish music talent on RTÉ. The album The Swell Season, in collaboration with a Czech singer and multi-instrumentalist Markéta Irglová, was released on in 2006 (the album also featured Marja Tuhkanen and Bertrand Galen).

&gt; Hansard starred in the movie 'Once' alongside Markéta Irglová which won a prestigious Sundance Audience Award in 2007, as well as the 2008 Academy Award for Best Original Song (for ""Falling Slowly""), beating three songs from the Disney musical ""Enchanted"" and one song from ""August Rush"" (both were heavy contenders). Its Irish release took place on 23rd March 2007 and appeared in cinemas further afield later in the year.

&gt; Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band formed in Bolton, Greater Manchester, UK in 1976, led by singer-songwriter and guitarist Pete Shelley (1955 – 2018) for nearly their entire existence.

&gt; They are commonly regarded as an important influence on the Manchester music scene, the independent record label movement and the punk rock, power pop, pop punk and indie rock genres in general. They are primarily remembered for their singles, a string of would-be hits that combined a strong grasp of pop song craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy. These singles were collected on Singles Going Steady, described by critic Ned Raggett as a ""punk masterpiece"" The widely covered ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" remains one of their best-known songs.

&gt; The name ""Buzzcocks"" partially comes from the Manchester slang term cock meaning youngster, and its use in the 1970s ITV drama serial Rock Follies which included the catch phrases ""that's the buzz, cocks"" and ""give me a buzz, cock!""

&gt; Buzzcocks were one of the key first generation British punk rock bands to form in the wake of the Sex Pistols in 1976. They were founded by Mancunians Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto, however Devoto left soon after the group released their Spiral Scratch EP (on their own independent label), leaving Shelley to take over vocals. 

&gt; They are best known for their catchy, poppy punk sound, which has been widely influential, which was adopted as Peter Shelley took over on the vocals, singing about what the whole punk rock scene opted not to sing about: love. Devoto in the meanwhile formed Magazine.

&gt; They rehearsed in a friend's kitchen and played at the all-day 100 club punk ""festival"", in London. At the end of 1977 the band signed to United Artists and released ""Orgasm Addict"", with Shelley's high-pitched vocal delivery and Ramones-esque fuzz-guitar sound ensuring the controversial single would be played over again. Later came ""What Do I Get?"" which hit the UK charts and showed Shelley's brilliance in songwriting.

&gt; An LP was then released, Another Music in a Different Kitchen which came with its own carrier bag, labelled ""Product"". In 1978-79 five chart-hitting singles were released including ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" and had captured a pop-loving audience by this time. Love Bites, their second LP was released later on, which had less excitement than the last album, though it did sell well, with Steve Diggle taking over lyric-writing.

&gt; October 1979 saw A Different Kind of Tension which was panned by some critics, quite unfairly, as it contains some excellent songs, the title track being the stand-out. It perhaps suffered from being the second album to be released that year, with the record company keen to capitalise on the band's chart success at the time. 

&gt; 3 more singles followed in 1980, but the spark had clearly gone out for a while. Musical differences and the long slog behind them led to the band splitting in early 1981. Pete Shelley embarked in a solo career.. 

&gt; He released three dance/electronic influenced solo albums: Homosapien, XL1 and Heaven and The Sea - all with the same fine songwriting skills. Meanwhile, Steve Diggle formed Flag of Convenience - a power pop combo -  and toured with some success. 

&gt; A 5 album/CD set was released in 1989 called Product, which contained all the albums to date, plus the greatest hits and B sides album, Singles Going Steady, and the last non-album singles, Why She's A Girl From the Chainstore, Airwaves Dream and Running Free, plus the B sides

&gt; In 1992 the Buzzcocks reformed, without original drummer John Maher and bassist Steve Garvey, and releasd Trade Test Transmissions in 1993, quite different from their earlier material, with nods to the power pop scene popular at the time. All Set in 1996 saw a return to form with familiar riffs and pin sharp lyrics pop-punk. Next year Chronology was released, the missing album, including outtakes from the three United Artists albums.  In 1999 they released Modern, which saw Shelley in reflective mode and Steve Diggle taking over more of the vocal duties.

&gt; Then followed another brief break in 2000, with Shelley teaming up with old band-mate Howard Devoto to release a largely disappointing album, Buzzkunst. Compilations followed, including Inventory in 2003, which contained every single to date, and 30 in 2005 to celebrate 30 years performing

&gt; 2005 saw the Buzzcocks back touring and in 2007 they released the superb Flat Pack Philosophy, widely agreed to rank up with the best of Buzzcocks output

&gt; 2008/9 saw a short tour where the band played tracks from Another Music and Love Bites.

&gt; In August 2011 they headlined the first night of The Rhythm Festival in Bedfordshire.

&gt; In November 2011 it was announced they would be playing two shows in 2012 that would feature the original line-up as well as the classic line-up of the band reunited for the first time in many years; these shows took place on 25 May 2012 in Manchester at the O2 Apollo and on 26 May in Brixton at the O2 Academy. It was announced on 26 May 2012 that, for the first time, they would headline Thursday night in the Empress Ballroom at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool sharing the stage with the likes of Rancid, Public Image Limited and Social Distortion.

&gt; On 1 May 2014 Buzzcocks released the album The Way via PledgeMusic. On 13 September 2014 Buzzcocks played ""a brief but triumphant set"" at Riot Fest 2014 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. In October 2014 Buzzcocks toured the U.K. for three weeks with The Dollyrots as main support.

&gt; In 2016, the band embarked on their 40th-anniversary tour (dubbed ""Buzzcocks 40""). In 2017, ""Why Can't I Touch It"" was featured in the opening segment of the Telltale game 'Guardians of the Galaxy.

&gt; Buzzcocks continue to be a huge influence on many bands and are still enjoyed by a large, and very loyal, fanbase.

&gt; Pete Shelley died on 6 December 2018. Read more on Last.fm.

So I can acknowledge the gold without totally ruining the quality of the comment.

EDIT: Thank you kind stranger! I always knew this day would come, but I never knew when. After every post, every comment, I ask myself ""is this the one? Will this be the piece of content to finally move someone to spend five bucks to make my experience on this app slightly better?"" That usually gets me thinking about the unique social dynamic Reddit's premium system fosters. Although most of their profits come from advertisers and their main product is us - the audience- it is interesting that the only product they provide for us to purchase is charity. It makes sense from a business perspective, as any free platform makes most of their money from a select group of high-spending users, their ""Whales"". However, standard premium memberships limit the spending capacity of each whale, since they can't buy themselves two premium memberships on the same account. However, by allowing them to provide that membership and recognition of quality to whatever other user they deem fit, Reddit allows the whales to spend as much as they want and keep the money flowing. This dependency on the altruism of Whales naturally draws some parallels to nature (pun intended). Nature's whales provide food, aid, and transport to all kinds of organisms, from the barnacle to the remora? But they are not essential to their survival. So too do the whales of Reddit help those who don't really need it but sure do appreciate it. Which brings me to my next point: the perceived value of gold and currency's worth in modern society. People often argue that money as a concept is manipulative because of its lack of inherent value, and that we should bring back some form of gold or silver standard. But that also presents a bit of a problem, because gold has no reason to be considered to be considered any more valuable than any other metal. Sure it looks nice, but what else has it got going for it? It's conductive, but I really doubt the gold sitting in Fort Knox is being used for circuitboards. It's not. It's only there to serve itself and sit around being valuable. And yet our entire world economy, and every system that depends on money, rely entirely on our perception that gold and currency hold value. What would happen if everyone decided to move on from gold? How would society collapse? What would end us first? Would we fight until there were none of us left? Would the collapse of every government bring about famine and disease, which would spread unchecked with no health organizations to stop it? Or would we mostly be fine, since most people are decent at heart? These apocalyptic hypotheticals entertain me, which is probably why I'm so drawn to high-brow intellectual entertainment on the nature of man, like Undertale or Rick and Morty. Stories like those just shake me to my core, with their potent character moments and plot twists, and I really can't understand how people can criticize them. If you can't appreciate the quality storytelling, acting, music, and tone that these tales convey, I'm sorry, but I will not weep for you. At that point, it's a choice you've made to ignore high-class intellectual entertainment. On a lighter note, I do appreciate the resurgence in popularity of Undertale, Megolovania in particular. This is naturally due to the post-launch support the game is receiving, which is unprecedented in scale, quality, and haste among indie games, and games in general. Never, in the history of entertainment, ever, has a piece of media received a second part of the scale or quality Undertale has this quickly, and I don't expect it ever to be topped. The only piece of entertainment media I could see getting the treatment Undertale has is Rick and Morty, because of the intense care and effort put in by the entire creative team, day and night, nonstop, for intellectuals like me. With that said, I really think we should discuss the creative bankruptcy of the television and film industries, since Rick's quest for galactic redemption seems to be at odds with the whims of studio executives. Funding seems to be driving everything dangerously towards what will make a profit rather than what is artistically valuable. Take Illumination studios. They take classic tales like The Grinch and Sing and push out the most unremarkable product they can on the lowest budget reasonable, and then market like they're on borrowed time. You cannot escape the Illumination marketing team. They're everywhere. Your TV, your memes, your aunts, etc. I liked Despicable Me, I thought it was a fine film, Steve Carrell was great, but the marketing for the spinoff made me retroactively hate a movie that used to be a favorite of mine. Hopefully their studio burns down before they finish work on that Shrek reboot, because I cannot stand to see that (Academy Award Winning) series tarnished by such a morally corrupt corporation.",,,,,False,False,[],False,,"{'gid_1': 1, 'gid_2': 1}",,,False,,True,t3_bb9g0f,,,,/r/starterpacks/comments/bb9g0f/redditor_with_over_1k_upvotes_on_a_comment/eki8oo7/,public,False,,,,,1554850164.0,r/starterpacks,0,,,,,,1516641118.0,,False,1557942473.0,,,

Love Bites, their second LP was released later on, which had less excitement than the last album, though it did sell well, with Steve Diggle taking over lyric-writing.

&gt; October 1979 saw A Different Kind of Tension which was panned by some critics, quite unfairly, as it contains some excellent songs, the title track being the stand-out. It perhaps suffered from being the second album to be released that year, with the record company keen to capitalise on the band's chart success at the time. 

&gt; 3 more singles followed in 1980, but the spark had clearly gone out for a while. Musical differences and the long slog behind them led to the band splitting in early 1981. Pete Shelley embarked in a solo career.. 

&gt; He released three dance/electronic influenced solo albums: Homosapien, XL1 and Heaven and The Sea - all with the same fine songwriting skills. Meanwhile, Steve Diggle formed Flag of Convenience - a power pop combo -  and toured with some success. 

&gt; A 5 album/CD set was released in 1989 called Product, which contained all the albums to date, plus the greatest hits and B sides album, Singles Going Steady, and the last non-album singles, Why She's A Girl From the Chainstore, Airwaves Dream and Running Free, plus the B sides

&gt; In 1992 the Buzzcocks reformed, without original drummer John Maher and bassist Steve Garvey, and releasd Trade Test Transmissions in 1993, quite different from their earlier material, with nods to the power pop scene popular at the time. All Set in 1996 saw a return to form with familiar riffs and pin sharp lyrics pop-punk. Next year Chronology was released, the missing album, including outtakes from the three United Artists albums.  In 1999 they released Modern, which saw Shelley in reflective mode and Steve Diggle taking over more of the vocal duties.

&gt; Then followed another brief break in 2000, with Shelley teaming up with old band-mate Howard Devoto to release a largely disappointing album, Buzzkunst. Compilations followed, including Inventory in 2003, which contained every single to date, and 30 in 2005 to celebrate 30 years performing

&gt; 2005 saw the Buzzcocks back touring and in 2007 they released the superb Flat Pack Philosophy, widely agreed to rank up with the best of Buzzcocks output

&gt; 2008/9 saw a short tour where the band played tracks from Another Music and Love Bites.

&gt; In August 2011 they headlined the first night of The Rhythm Festival in Bedfordshire.

&gt; In November 2011 it was announced they would be playing two shows in 2012 that would feature the original line-up as well as the classic line-up of the band reunited for the first time in many years; these shows took place on 25 May 2012 in Manchester at the O2 Apollo and on 26 May in Brixton at the O2 Academy. It was announced on 26 May 2012 that, for the first time, they would headline Thursday night in the Empress Ballroom at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool sharing the stage with the likes of Rancid, Public Image Limited and Social Distortion.

&gt; On 1 May 2014 Buzzcocks released the album The Way via PledgeMusic. On 13 September 2014 Buzzcocks played ""a brief but triumphant set"" at Riot Fest 2014 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. In October 2014 Buzzcocks toured the U.K. for three weeks with The Dollyrots as main support.

&gt; In 2016, the band embarked on their 40th-anniversary tour (dubbed ""Buzzcocks 40""). In 2017, ""Why Can't I Touch It"" was featured in the opening segment of the Telltale game 'Guardians of the Galaxy.

&gt; Buzzcocks continue to be a huge influence on many bands and are still enjoyed by a large, and very loyal, fanbase.

&gt; Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band formed in Bolton, Greater Manchester, UK in 1976, led by singer-songwriter and guitarist Pete Shelley (1955 – 2018) for nearly their entire existence.

&gt; They are commonly regarded as an important influence on the Manchester music scene, the independent record label movement and the punk rock, power pop, pop punk and indie rock genres in general. They are primarily remembered for their singles, a string of would-be hits that combined a strong grasp of pop song craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy. These singles were collected on Singles Going Steady, described by critic Ned Raggett as a ""punk masterpiece"" The widely covered ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" remains one of their best-known songs.

&gt; The name ""Buzzcocks"" partially comes from the Manchester slang term cock meaning youngster, and its use in the 1970s ITV drama serial Rock Follies which included the catch phrases ""that's the buzz, cocks"" and ""give me a buzz, cock!""

&gt; Buzzcocks were one of the key first generation British punk rock bands to form in the wake of the Sex Pistols in 1976. They were founded by Mancunians Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto, however Devoto left soon after the group released their Spiral Scratch EP (on their own independent label), leaving Shelley to take over vocals. 

&gt; They are best known for their catchy, poppy punk sound, which has been widely influential, which was adopted as Peter Shelley took over on the vocals, singing about what the whole punk rock scene opted not to sing about: love. Devoto in the meanwhile formed Magazine.

&gt; They rehearsed in a friend's kitchen and played at the all-day 100 club punk ""festival"", in London. At the end of 1977 the band signed to United Artists and released ""Orgasm Addict"", with Shelley's high-pitched vocal delivery and Ramones-esque fuzz-guitar sound ensuring the controversial single would be played over again. Later came ""What Do I Get?"" which hit the UK charts and showed Shelley's brilliance in songwriting.

&gt; An LP was then released, Another Music in a Different Kitchen which came with its own carrier bag, labelled ""Product"". In 1978-79 five chart-hitting singles were released including ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" and had captured a pop-loving audience by this time. Love Bites, their second LP was released later on, which had less excitement than the last album, though it did sell well, with Steve Diggle taking over lyric-writing.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; Janelle Monáe (born Janelle Monáe Robinson on December 1, 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and performer.

&gt;  She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

&gt; Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band formed in Bolton, Greater Manchester, UK in 1976, led by singer-songwriter and guitarist Pete Shelley (1955 – 2018) for nearly their entire existence.

&gt; They are commonly regarded as an important influence on the Manchester music scene, the independent record label movement and the punk rock, power pop, pop punk and indie rock genres in general. They are primarily remembered for their singles, a string of would-be hits that combined a strong grasp of pop song craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy. These singles were collected on Singles Going Steady, described by critic Ned Raggett as a ""punk masterpiece"" The widely covered ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" remains one of their best-known songs.

&gt; The name ""Buzzcocks"" partially comes from the Manchester slang term cock meaning youngster, and its use in the 1970s ITV drama serial Rock Follies which included the catch phrases ""that's the buzz, cocks"" and ""give me a buzz, cock!""

&gt; Buzzcocks were one of the key first generation British punk rock bands to form in the wake of the Sex Pistols in 1976. They were founded by Mancunians Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto, however Devoto left soon after the group released their Spiral Scratch EP (on their own independent label), leaving Shelley to take over vocals. 

&gt; They are best known for their catchy, poppy punk sound, which has been widely influential, which was adopted as Peter Shelley took over on the vocals, singing about what the whole punk rock scene opted not to sing about: love. Devoto in the meanwhile formed Magazine.

&gt; They rehearsed in a friend's kitchen and played at the all-day 100 club punk ""festival"", in London. At the end of 1977 the band signed to United Artists and released ""Orgasm Addict"", with Shelley's high-pitched vocal delivery and Ramones-esque fuzz-guitar sound ensuring the controversial single would be played over again. Later came ""What Do I Get?"" which hit the UK charts and showed Shelley's brilliance in songwriting.

&gt; An LP was then released, Another Music in a Different Kitchen which came with its own carrier bag, labelled ""Product"". In 1978-79 five chart-hitting singles were released including ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" and had captured a pop-loving audience by this time. Love Bites, their second LP was released later on, which had less excitement than the last album, though it did sell well, with Steve Diggle taking over lyric-writing.

&gt; October 1979 saw A Different Kind of Tension which was panned by some critics, quite unfairly, as it contains some excellent songs, the title track being the stand-out. It perhaps suffered from being the second album to be released that year, with the record company keen to capitalise on the band's chart success at the time. 

&gt; 3 more singles followed in 1980, but the spark had clearly gone out for a while. Musical differences and the long slog behind them led to the band splitting in early 1981. Pete Shelley embarked in a solo career.. 

&gt; He released three dance/electronic influenced solo albums: Homosapien, XL1 and Heaven and The Sea - all with the same fine songwriting skills. Meanwhile, Steve Diggle formed Flag of Convenience - a power pop combo -  and toured with some success. 

&gt; A 5 album/CD set was released in 1989 called Product, which contained all the albums to date, plus the greatest hits and B sides album, Singles Going Steady, and the last non-album singles, Why She's A Girl From the Chainstore, Airwaves Dream and Running Free, plus the B sides

&gt; In 1992 the Buzzcocks reformed, without original drummer John Maher and bassist Steve Garvey, and releasd Trade Test Transmissions in 1993, quite different from their earlier material, with nods to the power pop scene popular at the time. All Set in 1996 saw a return to form with familiar riffs and pin sharp lyrics pop-punk. Next year Chronology was released, the missing album, including outtakes from the three United Artists albums.  In 1999 they released Modern, which saw Shelley in reflective mode and Steve Diggle taking over more of the vocal duties.

&gt; Then followed another brief break in 2000, with Shelley teaming up with old band-mate Howard Devoto to release a largely disappointing album, Buzzkunst. Compilations followed, including Inventory in 2003, which contained every single to date, and 30 in 2005 to celebrate 30 years performing

&gt; 2005 saw the Buzzcocks back touring and in 2007 they released the superb Flat Pack Philosophy, widely agreed to rank up with the best of Buzzcocks output

&gt; 2008/9 saw a short tour where the band played tracks from Another Music and Love Bites.

&gt; In August 2011 they headlined the first night of The Rhythm Festival in Bedfordshire.

&gt; In November 2011 it was announced they would be playing two shows in 2012 that would feature the original line-up as well as the classic line-up of the band reunited for the first time in many years; these shows took place on 25 May 2012 in Manchester at the O2 Apollo and on 26 May in Brixton at the O2 Academy. It was announced on 26 May 2012 that, for the first time, they would headline Thursday night in the Empress Ballroom at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool sharing the stage with the likes of Rancid, Public Image Limited and Social Distortion.

&gt; On 1 May 2014 Buzzcocks released the album The Way via PledgeMusic. On 13 September 2014 Buzzcocks played ""a brief but triumphant set"" at Riot Fest 2014 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. In October 2014 Buzzcocks toured the U.K. for three weeks with The Dollyrots as main support.

&gt; In 2016, the band embarked on their 40th-anniversary tour (dubbed ""Buzzcocks 40""). In 2017, ""Why Can't I Touch It"" was featured in the opening segment of the Telltale game 'Guardians of the Galaxy.

&gt; Buzzcocks continue to be a huge influence on many bands and are still enjoyed by a large, and very loyal, fanbase.

&gt; Pete Shelley died on 6 December 2018. Read more on Last.fm.

Stuff like Saga yeah, Chew, Umbrella Academy, Morning Glories, lots of Image and indie stuff. But also do like super hero ones too. Was well into it but got out of that trap, so expensive. I tend to just wait for the trades now or a big old mega hardcover collection. So much media competing for our time right. What is High Level? A comic?

I'm still dipping my toes into quote unquote indy games as I'm a console only gamer and most of them come to pc first so I do try to keep a list and wait for en to inevitably come to Switch 😎. Finished Witcher 3 for the first time last month, have been trying since launch had to restart this year as I dropped it a few months in and forgot everything. Giving some time before I tackle the DLCs. In that time I decided to try out loads of demo &amp; got a trial Game Pass (not a big Xbox player but got one for free with a laptop years ago). Thomas Was Alone was worth the pass alone. Did Quantum Break too which was just my level of story and weird sci-fi. Cheesy but love the mo cap work they put into it and thought I'd paly it as excited for Control.

Just as you messaged me I finished the first DLC for Spider-Man. Had saved them to play once they all game out in one go so I'll probably do the rest over the weekend. Horizon and God of War were my fav games possibly ever, as well as BOTW. I'm more story over gameplay tbh I know that's usually not a popular opinion among gamers but I see it as playing a cool movie or TV series. Sometimes I like the challenge of a puzzler or had combat game but what I want out of it is story. 

Love stories, movies, games, comics, wrestling, music, podcasts. Any type of story if its told well and tickles my fancy.

&gt; C Duncan (born Christopher Duncan, 29 July 1989) is a Scottish composer and musician. His debut album, Architect, was nominated for the 2015 Mercury Music Prize.

&gt; The son of two classical musicians, he was surrounded by music throughout his childhood. He initially took up piano and viola. His teens led him to school bands – learning to play guitar, bass and drums – but did little to quell his fascination with the composition and performance of classical music. He eventually enrolled in Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland) to study music composition, where his pieces were performed by various ensembles across the UK.

&gt; To hear C Duncan’s music now is to grasp those two common threads between his interests in classical and modern music. The pieces that make up his forthcoming debut LP are formed from lush choral harmonies and acoustic instrumentation, textured like contemporary dreampop and all recorded at home in Glasgow on his bedroom studio setup, gradually built up one layer and one instrument at a time. The results of this methodical and isolationist recording process give us charming lo-fi folk with the harmonic width of choral composition, the sweetness of barbershop and the rough eloquence that has so readily soundtracked Glasgow over the past decades.

&gt; He is also an accomplished painter, naming Grant Wood and Gerhard Richter as influences. His work has been exhibited throughout Scotland and he provides cover art for his own records, expressing the same musical ideas through painted image. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Poi Dog Pondering is an American musical group, noted for its cross-pollination of diverse musical genres, including various forms of acoustic folk music, and electronic music. Founded in Hawaii in 1985 around the creative vision of lead singer-songwriter Frank Orrall, the band moved to Austin, Texas in 1987, where they recorded their first three albums. In 1992, the band (with ever-evolving membership) relocated once again, this time to Chicago, Illinois, and began to incorporate elements of house music into their style.

&gt; Orrall took the band's pop folk direction into electronic &amp; ambient house music in the later 1990's ,but has since returned to explore the soft rock, folk, country &amp; soul influences that gave the band it's initial audience on the indie Texas Hotel imprint and eventual major label contract with Columbia/Sony in the late 1980's.

&gt; Poi Dog Pondering ""the little big band with the strong back and supple/stubborn heart"" has been following its intuition for 20 years.  From bohemian street buskers to impossible-to-market major label sacrificial lambs, PdP have ripened into  staunchly independent musical voyagers.  Every sound that has excited them flows through their music and floods it with ever changing colors - acoustic, folk, global music, big band disco, electronic textures, orchestral collaborations, ROCK and SOUL - threaded with lyrics that embrace both the beauty and pain that life can bring.

&gt; Poi dog Pondering formed in Hawaii in 1986.  The first live performance was at the Honolulu Arts Academy.  Filled with youthful exuberance and inspiration from ready about Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground's  ""Exploding Plastic Inevitable"" projected film and music happening, PdP projected films of lava eruptions, ocean and other natural environments over the band as they performed.  The tradition of projected imagery along with PdP live performances has developed and matured over the years and continues.

&gt; There is a bolstered sense of history within the band now, a swagger that comes from having steadfastly carved their own path.  It is quite apparent that PdP has always been, and ever will be in it for the love of it; creating and performing.  Line up changes are par for the course.  PdP is an organic entity, it changes like life does.  But there is a core with strong roots, open to new eras and ready to experiment.  That's what keeps it vibrant.

&gt; Band leader, Frank Orrall's interest in electronic music garnered him respect from the Chicago House/Electronic music community for his solo project 8fatfat8, and lead him to become a member of Thievery Corporation as percussionist and vocalist.  All this influenced 2 of PDP’s Natural Thing and In Seed Comes Fruit albums which saw the band experimenting with electronic textures, beautiful lush arrangements and un-hurried, sometimes instrumental song structures, letting musicality determine the song structure, rather than traditional ""verse / chorus / bridge"" style song writing.

&gt; 
Poi dog Pondering delivered a Rock and Soul record with "" 7 "",their 7th studio album, 14 cuts deep and layered in horns, strings, immediate guitars; sometimes shimmering and liquid, &amp; sometimes ""crunch and gristle"".  A painter's  pallete of unique instruments, vintage keyboards, ""on the sleeve"" lyrics, gripping bass &amp; drums and beautiful harmonies.  Known for following their heart, this record finds PdP playful, intimate, honest, cocky, boisterous and definitely ready to take it live.

&gt; 

&gt; “Poi is becoming one of the longest running and most spirited do-it-yourself musical institutions in the country, defying the odds of commerce and interpersonal relationships by keeping a 12 piece band viable…” – GREG KOT, CHICAGO TRIBUNE

&gt; “The Poi Dog sound happens because of the real and deep connection between the
players, which shows in how they listen to one another in performance. The fact that most of them have been doing just that for two decades only increases the power of community they bring to the stage.” - NO DEPRESSION (January 2008, Live Review) Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; British-born Carina Round is a singer-songwriter whom has earned tremendous accolades from fans, critics and the artistic community alike for both her distinctive, yet versatile vocal style and gut wrenchingly honest songwriting.

&gt; Her critically acclaimed performances are nothing short of spectacular. She runs the gamut from “howling siren” to the performer of ethereal confessional tales, disbanding all concepts of musical tags. It is no wonder she has shared stages with an array of diverse artists such as Annie Lennox, Billy Corgan, Maynard James Keenan, Ryan Adams, Elbow, The Gutter Twins, Snow Patrol, Miles Hunt (The Wonder Stuff), Mark Eitzel, and the legendary James Brown. 

&gt; Growing up in Wolverhampton, England, Carina, starting from a very young age, always had an affinity towards music and began to follow her musical dreams. Never losing sight of her goals, her determination and passion led to the recording of her first album The First Blood Mystery (2001). Shaped in the erratic but gripping sounds, her love of legends Patti Smith and Jeff Buckley resonates undeniably. 

&gt; The follow-up and Interscope re-released debut album: The Disconnection (2004) took those influences into much more powerful and personal realms. It landed Carina worldwide exposure in the process, which ultimately brought her career to Los Angeles, California. The relocation proved worthwhile. For Slow Motion Addict (2007), Carina teamed up with notable producer Glen Ballard to create a bewitching and seductive new album. Accompanying the release was a 12-part episodic series that cleverly coincided with each track, creating a visual story for the album. It gave Carina another medium to showcase her artistic ability by acting and starring as the troubled lead character, Maisie Scarlett. 

&gt; Two years later, Carina self-released the EP Things You Should Know in 2009 that resulted in more critical success, having multiple film &amp; TV shows feature her music as well as multiple radio stations, including KCRW, champion her music. Opportunities came flooding in to work with other artists Carina has admired over the years. 

&gt; Since 2009 she is also a member of the band Puscifer, the Solo-Project of Tool- and A Perfect Circle-Vocalist Maynard James Keenan, contributing the female and 2nd voice in live shows and on albums of the band. She also sang vocals on The Twilight Singers new album ‘Dynamite Steps’ along with other artists Nick McCabe (The Verve), Mark Lanegan, and Ani DiFranco, among others. In addition to this, Carina moved into the world of composing and writing for film, working with the award winning film composers John Debney and Glen Ballard on a song that was composed for the film Valentine’s Day, writing with Academy Award winner Marco Beltrami, as well as various others. 

&gt; In one of Carina’s co-writing sessions for film &amp; TV, a band was created called Early Winters with EMI Canadian artist Justin Rutledge, L.A. producer/musician Dan Burns and multi-instrumentalist Zac Rae. The band is an indie rock band with touches of country and folk flare, which draw comparisons to Neko Case and the Swell Season. 

&gt; All of these projects were an inspirational stepping stone for Carina to completing her newest album Tigermending which was released May 1st 2012 through her label Dehisce. On the new track ‘Got To Go (The L.A Song) features Smashing Pumpkins’ front man Billy Corgan playing guitar and she co-wrote the haunting track ‘The Secret of Drowning’ with the legendary Dave Stewart and Brian Eno.

&gt; Comparisons are frequently drawn to PJ Harvey, though Round would contend that she is more directly influenced by Patti Smith.

&gt; Cass McCombs (born in Concord, California in 1977) is an American singer-songwriter and performer.

&gt; An enigmatic folk nomad, McCombs is a quintessentially American artist; ""he's quietly become one of (the country's) finest chroniclers of fringe characters, a writer of heart-rending love songs and psychedelic odes to the natural world, a teller of tall-tales with a sense of humor dry as desert wood, and that rare folksinger who actually sings about the folk."" His vocals range somewhere between the anxious drone of Lou Reed, the hollow croon of Elliott Smith, the lilting melody of Morrissey, and the driving earnestness and complexity of bards such as Leonard Cohen or Bob Dylan. His lyrical style is alternately vivid and weary, laconic and yearning, or drifting into the high-spirited and whimsical.

&gt; After cutting his first EP, Not the Way in San Francisco in 2001, McCombs relocated to Baltimore, MD. There he released ""Not the Way"" in 2002 and recorded his first full-length, A, in 2003 on Monitor Records. He spent the next few years touring: playing All Tomorrow's Parties; and opening for bands such as Modest Mouse, The Decemberists, and Belle and Sebastian; before recording his second LP PREfection, which was released on 4AD in 2005. 

&gt; McCombs' subsequent releases have been on the highly successful British independent label Domino Recording Co. 2007's Dropping the Writ was named one of Amazon's Best Albums of that year. Catacombs was voted one of the 50 greatest albums of 2009 by Pitchfork Media, and features Academy Award-nominated actress and singer Karen Black on the track Dreams-Come-True-Girl. During this period, McCombs toured with the likes of Arcade Fire, Andrew Bird, Band of Horses, José González, Beach House, and The Walkmen.

&gt; Catacombs also established McCombs' relationship with engineer/producer Ariel Rechtshaid, member of The Hippos and Foreign Born, who produced Grammy-winning hit Climax for Usher, the Plain White T's Grammy-nominated No.1 platinum-selling single Hey There Delilah, and albums for Vampire Weekend, Sky Ferreira, Snoop Lion, and Haim, among others.

&gt; In 2010 McCombs played Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago, L.A.'s Culture Collide Festival and Invisible Children Benefit. 2011 offered an extensive headlining tour, an appearance at SXSW, and two albums released by McCombs and produced by Rechtshaid: Wit's End in April and Humor Risk in November. The two albums were made simultaneously. In an interview with Pitchfork, McCombs explains: ""Wit's End was started years ago and it slowly made its way to the finish line. Humor Risk was just punched out. They're friends but they're different. Wit's End is like a stew; Humor Risk is the raw food diet.""

&gt; Big Wheel and Others, McCombs' seventh full-length (and first double album) was released in October 2013. The album is rooted in the Americana mythos of the Wild West, from the San Francisco drug culture to the gunslingers and gold rush of the nineteenth century. The album once again features Karen Black on a version of the track Brighter!, her final recording before passing away due to ampullary cancer in August, 2013. Big Wheel is dedicated to her memory.

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD ""Edgy In Brixton"" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London. The DVD contains a full live performance of the debut album Costello Music, B-Sides from various singles and a new song called Pretty Like a Girl. Extras on the DVD include the band being asked questions by members of The Fratellis' website, and on the deluxe edition, highlights from the T In The Park 2007 festival. It was released in the United States on the 30 October 2007

&gt; 2007-2008: Here We Stand

&gt; On November 20, 2007, it was announced on the Fratellis' official website that work had begun on the second album in rehearsal space in Glasgow. The band stated that they are self-producing the album and have their own studio to record in. Recording finished on January 13, 2008.

&gt; On February 22, 2008, they played a small show for fans at Queen Margaret Union to debut new songs from the upcoming album. About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. The first single from the album was called ""Mistress Mabel"" and was released on May 26, 2008. The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd. The Fratellis released a deluxe edition of Here We Stand internationally on December the 8th. The CD includes a new song titled 'Moriarty's Last Stand' and the accompanying DVD includes ""The Year Of The Thief"" (A documentary of the band on the road in the US); A live show filmed on June 18th 2008 at the Fillmore, San Francisco; performances of Milk and Money, Flathead and Mistress Mabel from Abbey Road Studios and the videos for the singles Mistress Mabel and Look Out Sunshine!
On April, 22 2010, both singer Jon Lawler and bassist Barry Wallace posted messages on their forum saying the band are unlikely to record together again soon.

&gt; The Fratellis have announced during June 2012 that they have decided to reform to help raise money for The Eilidh Brown Memorial Fund on the 15th of June at the MacRobert Centre in Stirling. The band plans on announcing more dates for later in the year.
The band then announced an extensive UK tour during December 2012 to take place in April 2013. During the UK tour, 3 more songs were debuted live; ""She's Not Gone Yet (But She's Leaving), Seven Days and Whiskey Saga.
On February 4th 2013, The Fratellis announced they had finished recording their third album, which was revealed to be called We Need Medicine with a release date of October 7th 2013. ""Seven Nights Seven Days"" was released as a single on September 29th. The album was recorded in Glasgow with Jon Fratelli and Stuart McCredie on production duties.

&gt; On the 24th of April 2013 it was announced that The Fratellis would be headlining Brownstock Festival in Essex on Sunday the 1st of September.

&gt; On the 22nd June 2013 The Fratellis headlined New College Commemoration Ball, a white-tie Ball set in the grounds of New College, Oxford.
On 13th October 2013 their new album We Need Medicine debuted at at number 26. Read more on Last.fm.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/44d42242ea024df68f0cbb25dd68dcda.png)  

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

&gt; A Hamilton, Ontario-based electronic pop group, Junior Boys began as a duo with its duties split between Jeremy Greenspan and Johnny Dark. Influenced by a number of music sectors — including arty synthpop, minimal techno, uk garage, and contemporary hip-hop — they made a demo with no positive results. Dark opted to leave the group, but former Warp employee Nick Kilroy eventually heard the songs and became interested enough to begin his KIN label with Junior Boys as its first artist. Engineer Matt Didemus joined Greenspan, and together they recorded enough material for a full-length. Prior to the 2004 release of the resulting album, titled Last Exit, a pair of 12"" singles were released — one included a remix from Fennesz, while the other featured a remix from Manitoba (now Caribou).

&gt; Three months after Last Exit's initial U.K. release, Domino picked up the album for distribution in the U.S. The Domino version added a bonus disc with B-sides and remixes from the 12"" releases. The relatively slick So This Is Goodbye followed in 2006. The single ""In The Morning"" was featured in an iTunes commercial in 2007.

&gt; On July 10, 2007, Junior Boys second album was revealed as being on the shortlist for the 2007 Polaris Music Prize. They did not ultimately win the prize.

&gt; In September 2008, Morgan Geist's album ""Double Night Time"" was released with five songs performed by Jeremy Greenspan.

&gt; On April 7, 2009, the duo released their third full length album, Begone Dull Care on Domino records. The album is named for a short film by Academy Award-winning National Film Board animator Norman McLaren. The front cover gives the band name in French, along with Caprice en Couleurs, the French title of the film; the entirety of the liner notes is presented bilingually, including song titles.

&gt; On June 13, 2011, Junior Boys released It's All True. It is the fourth studio album.      You are viewing an older version of this page, from 23 May 2016, 1:29. You might like to view the latest version. The music belongs to oren maizlin and only.    Read more on Last.fm.

If you like Bones, you probably already know Xavier Wulf, but if you don’t, he’s always a good pick. Also, OmenXIII.

For Lean, I would say that Bladee, Ecco2k, and Thaiboy Digital are the closest to that sound, and they have a lot of collaborations with him. Also, Lean has other non rap music under Jonaton Leandoer127 that’s very different but still good.

I’ve been looking for artists that are similar to surrenderdorothy, and I haven’t had much luck. Wicca Phase Springs Eternals acoustic songs are close, but they’re much better produced then SD’s stuff, so it’s not the same. I would recommend listening to some lofi indie stuff though.

&gt; Mission of Burma is an American post-punk band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1979. The band was formed by Roger Miller (guitar), Clint Conley (bass), Peter Prescott (drums) and Martin Swope (tape manipulator/sound engineer). Miller, Conley and Prescott share singing and songwriting duties. Like many of their post-punk contemporaries, Mission of Burma's efforts are largely concerned with extending punk's original vocabulary without losing its essential rebellious spirit. Using rapid shifts in dynamics, unconventional time signatures and chord progressions along with tape effects, Mission of Burma challenges the prevailing idioms of punk while attempting to retain its power and immediacy.

&gt; In early years the band's audience was limited to the Boston area, with all their recordings released on the small Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. The band released only one album in its original form, Vs.. Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope, and has since recorded two more albums, ONoffON and The Obliterati.

&gt; Their wall-of-noise musical sound extended the vocabulary of punk while continuing to hold clear its sense of power and abandon.  They used a number of tape effects, different chord progressions, and time shifts to highlight their formal training in music.  Not only that but they are seen now as a highly influential band to both post-punk and experimental music to come after; many bands cite Burma as an inspiration, including Nirvana, Superchunk, Creed, The Grifters, R.E.M. (who regularly covered ""Academy Fight Song"" on their Green tour), Sonic Youth, Throwing Muses, Yo La Tengo, Soul Asylum, Pixies, Sugar, Catherine Wheel, Guided by Voices, Graham Coxon and Moby - the last two of which have covered """"That's When I Reach For My Revolver.""

&gt; The band were due to tour in 1980 with Joy Division but the suicide of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's singer, canceled the tour. In 1983, after releasing their only full-length studio record Vs., the group disbanded due to Miller's worsening tinnitus.

&gt; The band found increasing relevance throughout the 90s, culminating in the publication of Michael Azzerad's essays Our Band Could Be Your Life which featured Mission of Burma. In 2002, they reunited and began playing reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and formerly Prescott's Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller relates that ""when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin's position, we told him he could use current digital technology which accomplishes Martin's antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted for maintaining the original integrity, and uses a tape deck.""

&gt; Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band formed in Bolton, Greater Manchester, UK in 1976, led by singer-songwriter and guitarist Pete Shelley (1955 – 2018) for nearly their entire existence.

&gt; They are commonly regarded as an important influence on the Manchester music scene, the independent record label movement and the punk rock, power pop, pop punk and indie rock genres in general. They are primarily remembered for their singles, a string of would-be hits that combined a strong grasp of pop song craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy. These singles were collected on Singles Going Steady, described by critic Ned Raggett as a ""punk masterpiece"" The widely covered ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" remains one of their best-known songs.

&gt; The name ""Buzzcocks"" partially comes from the Manchester slang term cock meaning youngster, and its use in the 1970s ITV drama serial Rock Follies which included the catch phrases ""that's the buzz, cocks"" and ""give me a buzz, cock!""

&gt; Buzzcocks were one of the key first generation British punk rock bands to form in the wake of the Sex Pistols in 1976. They were founded by Mancunians Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto, however Devoto left soon after the group released their Spiral Scratch EP (on their own independent label), leaving Shelley to take over vocals. 

&gt; They are best known for their catchy, poppy punk sound, which has been widely influential, which was adopted as Peter Shelley took over on the vocals, singing about what the whole punk rock scene opted not to sing about: love. Devoto in the meanwhile formed Magazine.

&gt; They rehearsed in a friend's kitchen and played at the all-day 100 club punk ""festival"", in London. At the end of 1977 the band signed to United Artists and released ""Orgasm Addict"", with Shelley's high-pitched vocal delivery and Ramones-esque fuzz-guitar sound ensuring the controversial single would be played over again. Later came ""What Do I Get?"" which hit the UK charts and showed Shelley's brilliance in songwriting.

&gt; An LP was then released, Another Music in a Different Kitchen which came with its own carrier bag, labelled ""Product"". In 1978-79 five chart-hitting singles were released including ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" and had captured a pop-loving audience by this time. Love Bites, their second LP was released later on, which had less excitement than the last album, though it did sell well, with Steve Diggle taking over lyric-writing.

&gt; October 1979 saw A Different Kind of Tension which was panned by some critics, quite unfairly, as it contains some excellent songs, the title track being the stand-out. It perhaps suffered from being the second album to be released that year, with the record company keen to capitalise on the band's chart success at the time. 

&gt; 3 more singles followed in 1980, but the spark had clearly gone out for a while. Musical differences and the long slog behind them led to the band splitting in early 1981. Pete Shelley embarked in a solo career.. 

&gt; He released three dance/electronic influenced solo albums: Homosapien, XL1 and Heaven and The Sea - all with the same fine songwriting skills. Meanwhile, Steve Diggle formed Flag of Convenience - a power pop combo -  and toured with some success. 

&gt; A 5 album/CD set was released in 1989 called Product, which contained all the albums to date, plus the greatest hits and B sides album, Singles Going Steady, and the last non-album singles, Why She's A Girl From the Chainstore, Airwaves Dream and Running Free, plus the B sides

&gt; In 1992 the Buzzcocks reformed, without original drummer John Maher and bassist Steve Garvey, and releasd Trade Test Transmissions in 1993, quite different from their earlier material, with nods to the power pop scene popular at the time. All Set in 1996 saw a return to form with familiar riffs and pin sharp lyrics pop-punk. Next year Chronology was released, the missing album, including outtakes from the three United Artists albums.  In 1999 they released Modern, which saw Shelley in reflective mode and Steve Diggle taking over more of the vocal duties.

&gt; Then followed another brief break in 2000, with Shelley teaming up with old band-mate Howard Devoto to release a largely disappointing album, Buzzkunst. Compilations followed, including Inventory in 2003, which contained every single to date, and 30 in 2005 to celebrate 30 years performing

&gt; 2005 saw the Buzzcocks back touring and in 2007 they released the superb Flat Pack Philosophy, widely agreed to rank up with the best of Buzzcocks output

&gt; 2008/9 saw a short tour where the band played tracks from Another Music and Love Bites.

&gt; In August 2011 they headlined the first night of The Rhythm Festival in Bedfordshire.

&gt; In November 2011 it was announced they would be playing two shows in 2012 that would feature the original line-up as well as the classic line-up of the band reunited for the first time in many years; these shows took place on 25 May 2012 in Manchester at the O2 Apollo and on 26 May in Brixton at the O2 Academy. It was announced on 26 May 2012 that, for the first time, they would headline Thursday night in the Empress Ballroom at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool sharing the stage with the likes of Rancid, Public Image Limited and Social Distortion.

&gt; On 1 May 2014 Buzzcocks released the album The Way via PledgeMusic. On 13 September 2014 Buzzcocks played ""a brief but triumphant set"" at Riot Fest 2014 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. In October 2014 Buzzcocks toured the U.K. for three weeks with The Dollyrots as main support.

&gt; In 2016, the band embarked on their 40th-anniversary tour (dubbed ""Buzzcocks 40""). In 2017, ""Why Can't I Touch It"" was featured in the opening segment of the Telltale game 'Guardians of the Galaxy.

&gt; Buzzcocks continue to be a huge influence on many bands and are still enjoyed by a large, and very loyal, fanbase.

&gt; Pete Shelley died on 6 December 2018. Read more on Last.fm.

Porterhouse- a must 
The Academy &amp; The Grand Social are two Dublin staples.

Coffee! And lunch
Simons place in georges st arcade facing georges street. Sit in Coffee €2.70, half portion of food is €2.50. Handy lunch for €5.20. Half portions are big enough to do you for lunch. I recommend the lentil potatos or pasta, it has these lovely spicy beans. They also do a good cinemon bun. Cheapest sit in coffee in Dublin I know of, and tastes great. 

Books Upstairs bookshop and cafe on D'Olier st.
Great bookshop with a great cafe. Great for reading and studying. Nice window seat that hangs over the street. Coffe is €2.90. Very cheap by Dublin standards.

Frank and Honest do nice coffee too, especially for something that comes from a machine. You can find them in Centra in Dame st and they have a barista and seats at that one too. 2.70 regular from machine.

Dunnes on Georges st do amazing chicken fillet rolls for €3.20. Very cheap and filling lunch. Irish people love chicken fillet rolls. Get spicy chicken. Its. A supermarket so no seats, but they also have a cafe sol station where you can get takeaway coffee for €2.

Govindas are an amazing vegan place and very affordable compared to other places. Lentil soup for 3.95 and you get a massive chunk of bread and a giant bowl of soup. The one north of Georges street.


Attractions

Of all Tourist attractions Kilmainham Gaol is a must. Amazing tour. 

St Michans church Crypts where you can touch a mummified dead Crusader for good luck. Be prepared to see 800 year old semi mumified bodies though. Look online I'm not sure if you have to pre book.

From the airport take the 16 or any other Dublin Bus yellow and blue buses besides the 102, its 2 times as long at about 35 min but you save over 6 euro or more.

Walk around Camden st yo see the murals, theres hundreds of nice graffiti one round the alley by RAW gym. Great pubs and coffee shops round here too. Walk around Ranelagh and Rathmines.

Visit Phibsborough, Smithfield and the Liberties too. All these are walking distance to the main cbd.  Its a more realistic depiction of Dublin than Temple bar. Which you should.avoid at all costs.

Day Trips-

You can take a bus from Poolbeg st to Glendalough return for like 20 euro youd have to look it up online.

Take the DART north to Howth, takes 30 min. Great pubs, eat at O Connells or the Bloody Stream. You can do the cliffwalks, look at the fishmongers or get fish and chips from cafe caira. Its a very Irish village feel. You can take a ferry to Ireland's eye.

Another day take the DART south to Dun laoighre (30 min), then to Dalkey (extra 10 min)  to see the 40 foot and dalkey village. Climb Kiliney Hill or take a boat to Dalkey Island. If its nice out walk Vico road where Ireland's most famous celebrities live. Its very forested with the coast and cliffs on one side and forest and the hill on the other.

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

If its another quest to bilk taxpayers, not so great. 

I am unclear on this line. What taxpayers are getting bilked here? Most of the people in this city left to surrounding counties decades ago. They aren't paying for any of this. The revitalization to the city is and has been to try and bring a tax paying population BACK to the city the whole time. The lack of support for our city has been the issue over twice as long as I have been alive. But this isn't the days of 15 years ago and Hal Craddock trying to sucker investors into revitalizing the city that was falling apart anymore. It has now been a quite proven path. Businesses are booming there again finally. The city is growing exponentially right now. Eyes from outside town are moving in. Also, how did you mean play favorites? 

I did participate in the parking conversation elsewhere in this post. I truly do not think is it a problem today relative to the cities size/population, and I do not think a new building downtown should wait for the city to add a bunch more parking we may need in the future. It doesn't work that way. A city grows and as demand for parking arises, it follows. I just noticed that the response to this article was about 80% about parking and the poor choice of car count in a concept drawing. I just didn't vibe with all the negativity. I am not ashamed of that. 

I apologize though. And I agree let's talk about the venue. I work for a large contractor here in town and I will admit that the older guys in my company are also kind of laughing at the idea of ANOTHER music venue opening downtown but I will continue to agree to disagree and I hope we get the work.

But yeah it depends on how all they use the space. The lower level has been a part of the indoor downtown market before. It has been a bowling alley. I am not sure what lower level mixed use is but some more shopping downtown would swell for all these people moving in down there over the past few years. 

And as for the upstairs venue, I am only going on the conceptual drawing, but it looks like a venue, mostly standing room, about the size of the Jefferson. That theatre in Charlottesville brings in a steady stream of radio or festival tier acts in the rock, indie, electronic, singer-songwriter, pop etc. That is not in Lynchburg. And who knows maybe this won't be that either. 

In LYH there is the outdoor temporary stage in a field that you have to admit is a different thing. They are doing a great job with 4-5 nice shows for a summer concert series but it is not going to compete with a venue. I also think places like Stoney Badger, glass house and 5th and federal have been great over the past 5 or fewer years in start to get some up and coming acts from other parts of the country, but these are still bars, give or take. 

Phase 2 has brought in some great names in country and rock, but they very clearly play to that niche crowd that works here in town, and also tend to get acts about 10+ years past their prime. I have had a blast there but again, that is a different animal.

The Academy Theatre and Ellington are both excellent historical renovations. The new Academy Theatre is gorgeous and I encourage everyone to go ASAP. They will have some great and classy music shows over a year, but absolutely their calendar will be 75-80% stage/theatre/film/dance productions. It is a theatre first and foremost.

I think the competition then for a new venue like this is the Academy Warehouse and the much smaller Ellington. But even if they can all bring in different parts of a current local, regional and national music scene I would never call that oversaturated. And I cannot vouch for all of their shows, but when I have been to a show for a known artist at these venues they crowd is pretty large and excited about the show. It is not as if we aren't able to get people out downtown when events do happen. The quote in the article about Lockn tickets sales in our 4 counties swarfing that of C-ville for a show like lockn when aside from the low-tier battle of the bands recent push at 5th and federal, none of those artists come through lynchburg is the takeaway for me. Following that logic, a demand is there. 

And all of this aside, we are talking about giant abandoned buildings in the direct heart of downtown. Them sitting empty has been the thorn in Lynchburg's side for 30 years. If this city is going to grow and have a beating heart again, it cannot be half old empty decaying buildings with their previous success stories in fading pant down the side. And if the population is coming back down there, the city should follow. We need to turn square footage into usable space. This is an awesome time for the city.

&gt; The Academy Is... was a rock band which formed in 2003 in Chicago, Illinois, United States. The band's longest lasting lineup consisted of William Beckett (vocals, guitar), Mike Carden (guitar, vocals), Michael Chislett (guitar, keyboards), Adam Siska (bass) and Andy Mrotek (drums). The band released three albums - ""Almost Here"" (2005), ""Santi"" (2007) and ""Fast Times at Barrington High"" (2008) - before disbanding in 2011, several months after Chislett and Mrotek left the band.

&gt; William Beckett (singer) and Adam T. Siska's (bass) plans for starting a band together came to fruition on March 4, 2003 recruiting Mike Carden (guitar) after his former band, Jodie, which had members of Victory Records act June, broke up then eventually adding AJ LaTrace as a lead guitarist and Michael DelPrincipe (Little Mike) as a drummer. They recorded their self-titled debut EP, The Academy (2004), for the Chicago-based label LLR Recordings. LLR Recordings had previously released Beckett's solo project Remember Maine's debut album The Last Place You Look in 2002 and Mike Carden's solo folk album in 2003. The EP was recorded in Villa Park, IL at The Gallery of Carpet by producer Brian Zieske. Pete Wentz from Fall Out Boy heard it and was impressed. The label Fueled by Ramen immediately signed the band.

&gt; In 2004 the band headed to Florida to record their Fueled by Ramen debut Almost Here, produced by James Paul Wisner, who has worked with Dashboard Confessional, Something Corporate, Further Seems Forever, and Underoath. After recording the album and a doing a summer tour, the band underwent a lineup change. Thomas Conrad, formerly of Chicago local band 5o4plan, replaced LaTrace as the second guitarist/backing vocalist and Andy Mrotek, formerly of Last Place Champs, replaced DelPrincipe as the drummer. Andy Mrotek and Thomas Conrad are listed in the liner notes, but were added to the band after the recording of Almost Here to replace DelPrincipe and LaTrace, respectively. They hit the road hard, touring with Fall Out Boy, Something Corporate, Midtown, Matchbook Romance, Motion City Soundtrack and Armor for Sleep. The album was released on February 8, 2005 and the following summer, the band embarked on their first headlining tour alongside Plain White T's, Days Away and June. On Billboard's charts Almost Here peaked at #7 on Top Heatseekers, #16 on Independent Albums, and #185 on The Billboard 200.

&gt; On October 26, 2006, The Academy Is... had announced via the blog on their official website that Thomas Conrad and the band had parted ways. Michael Guy Chislett joined the band to replace Conrad on guitar.

&gt; While touring as a main act on the 2006 Warped Tour, the band began the process of writing songs for their second album. Once finished, the band flew to Los Angeles to record their record with Butch Walker. As of December 23, 2006, the band had officially finished the recording process and the album, entitled Santi, was released April 3, 2007 on the Fueled By Ramen label. The release of this album was listed on Blender's 25 reasons to love 2007. On January 26, 2007 a sample of ""LAX to O'Hare"" was released on the band's AbsolutePunk profile. The album peaked at #32 on the Billboard 200.

&gt; The band went on to release the song ""We've Got a Big Mess on Our Hands"" as the album's first single, before releasing the album on April 3, 2007. Fall Out Boy, +44, Cobra Starship, and Paul Wall all joined the band on the 2007 Honda Civic Tour, after which the band moved on to the ""Sleeping With Giants"" tour with support from The Rocket Summer, Armor for Sleep and Sherwood. Partly through the tour, Cobra Starship was added to the support. The tour ended on November 24, 2007 in Chicago.

&gt; The band's third studio album, Fast Times at Barrington High, was released on August 19, 2008 through Fueled by Ramen. The title refers to the high school William Beckett, Adam Siska, and videographer Jack Edinger attended. The first single, ""About a Girl,"" was added to the band's MySpace page on July 15, 2008 and was subsequently made available from various download sites. The lead model in the official music video for ""About a Girl"", Brittany Moser, also went to Barrington the same time Adam and William were in high school. On August 25, 2008 ""About a Girl"" was played on The Hills (season 4, episode 2). They also released the songs ""Summer Hair = Forever Young"" and ""His Girl Friday"" of FTABH on their MySpace page and PureVolume page. The album made it onto Rolling Stone Magazine's 50 Best Albums of the Year ranked as #46. It peaked at #17 on The Billboard 200

&gt; On William Beckett's Twitter page, it was said The Academy Is... have finished recording their new EP, Lost in Pacific Time: The AP/EP. It was released on September 22, 2009 on iTunes, and will be sold on the AP Fall Ball Tour. A limited number will also be sold on their webstore The track ""I'm Yours Tonight"" has already been released, and is on the band's Myspace page. Another track, ""Days Like Masquerades"" was played at an anti-suicide benefit at Barrington High School, in Barrington, Illinois. William has also been posting or linking lyrics on his blog. The newest song, ""Sputter"" (featuring Jack's Mannequin singer Andrew McMahon), is streaming on Banana's Music club, linked by both William and Pete Wentz via Twitter on September 21.[citation needed] On September 29, 2009, Pete Wentz announced via Twitter that TAI would replace The All-American Rejects for the St. Louis date of the Blink-182 tour, due to an injury to the AAR lead singer Tyson Ritter.

&gt; On May 26, the band announced that they will be supporting Kiss on their upcoming summer tour. The band also said that this tour will not affect the release date or direction of their new record.

&gt; On the tour with Kiss, they have been playing a cover of Sweet's ""Fox on the Run"", of which they contributed a recorded version to the soundtrack of the movie When In Rome. It is unclear though, whether the song will appear on the band's upcoming studio album.

&gt; On March 23, 2011, William Beckett tweeted that the band is currently making demos for the upcoming album.

&gt; On May 24, 2011, The Academy Is... made an announcement on their official website that said that fellow bandmates, Andy Mrotek &amp; Michael Guy Chislett, were leaving the band to pursue their own musical careers. There has reportedly been no hard feelings during this decision. William Beckett also stated that the three remaining members would be entering the studio soon to record their fourth full-length album. This announcement featured a minute-and-a-half snippet of a track called ""Chicago"". Whether or not Mrotek and Chislett collaborated on the track is unknown.

&gt; On May 26, 2011, William Beckett tweeted that they had entered and recorded in the studio.

&gt; On October 8, 2011, The Academy Is... announced their disbanding on their official Facebook page, stating that they had ""decided to go [their] separate ways."" Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Elephant Kind started in mid 2013. In early 2010 Bam Mastro, also known as Bam, began exploring Western Australian Music scenes. This approach led him to creating a band called SaySky, who are fortunate enough to play in Perth's finest venue such as, Mojo's and The Rosemount. The band has been around for 3 years, and came third on Gozzy Rock Music Competition in 2011.
During the period of time with SaySky, Bam has built more confidence and knowledge of what it takes to be part of the Australian music industry, and also internationally.
Eager to pursue his career Bam started his solo project, Elephant Kind, along with his studies at WAAPA (Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts).

&gt; Bam collaborated with his sister on her project called Neonomora as a song writer, composer and music producer. This project has been very successful. Within a year, Neonomora, who recently released her latest EP that includes 5 songs written by Bam, was selected as 2013 Album of The Year by Rolling Stone Magazine INA. 

&gt; Moving back to Jakarta Bam started developing his career as a musician. His project with Neonomora led him to meeting John, Bayu and Dewa who then joined Elephant Kind. 
 
The songs contains lyrics and music that are emotional and relevant to the modern society and contemporary art with commercial viability. Combining various genres from various influences such as; Michael Jackson, Queen, Bon Iver, Kanye West, Sigur Ros, David Bowie, Arcade Fire, Kings of Leon, and many more.

&gt; Most of all, Bam has visions and high hopes in Australian music industry to continue to grow further and ready to be part of it.

There were plenty of popular movies this year that were well received critically. Look at A Quiet Place, Marry Poppins or Eighth Grade. The academy shouldn't purposefully choose not to vote for popular movies just because they're ""too mainstream"" and will ruin the exclusive image of the Oscar. Unfortunately, that's exactly what they do. And then they ask why nobody watches the Oscars. Because you make a point of nominating movies that nobody has fucking seen!

Also, did you even look at the Grammy nominees list this year? They overhauled a lot of their members and they actually got a lot of categories right this year. People who actually deserved nominations got them, like Janelle Monae, Kacey Musgraves, HER and Kendrick. People are complaining about the Grammys but if you look at the actual nominees and winners this year they pretty much line up with the popular consensus of what the best music of the year was. If the Grammy's were decided by Oscar voters, all the nominees would've been obscure, moody, obnoxious indie stuff. 

Edit: I feel like I should add this in. I think you're looking at it from the wrong perspective. 99% of people go to the movies to be entertained and enjoy themselves. Something like Roma is not entertaining or enjoyable. You might be part of a very small chunk of moviegoers who doesn't care about a movie being fun and just wants something ""unique"" and artsy. That's fine for you, but what annoys me is when people act like their way of enjoying movies is more valid than the ""mainstream"" way, and that anyone who likes to be entertained has bad taste.",,,,,False,False,[],False,,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",,,False,,True,t3_aqrcoa,,,,/r/Showerthoughts/comments/aqrcoa/you_cant_dope_to_win_the_olympics_but_you_can_use/egil5y2/,public,,,,,,1550214661.0,r/Showerthoughts,0,,,,,,1465779334.0,,False,1554242461.0,,,

""A living thing is born"", Wilson proclaims to the delegates. In his view the covenant is ""a definite guarantee of peace.... It is practical, and yet it is intended to purify, to rectify, to elevate."" Following the plenary session, Wilson confides to his wife: ""... the League can arbitrate and correct mistakes which are inevitable in the treaty we are trying to make at this time... one by one the mistakes can be brought to the League for readjustment, and the League will act as a permanent clearing house where every nation can come, the small as well as the great.""

President Wilson, who is about to make a short return trip to the United States to mend political fences, expresses strong opposition to keeping Allied soldiers in Russia and favours mediation. If the Prinkipo effort proves to be a non-starter, he supports the dispatch of a fact-finding commission to Russia. He is unimpressed by Churchill's emotional appeal not to withdraw Allied forces. ""Such a policy"", the British secretary of state for war and air insists, ""would be equivalent to pulling out the linch-pin from the whole machine. There would be no further resistance to the Bolsheviks in Russia, and an interminable vista of violence and misery was all that remained for the whole of Russia.""

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD ""Edgy In Brixton"" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London. The DVD contains a full live performance of the debut album Costello Music, B-Sides from various singles and a new song called Pretty Like a Girl. Extras on the DVD include the band being asked questions by members of The Fratellis' website, and on the deluxe edition, highlights from the T In The Park 2007 festival. It was released in the United States on the 30 October 2007

&gt; 2007-2008: Here We Stand

&gt; On November 20, 2007, it was announced on the Fratellis' official website that work had begun on the second album in rehearsal space in Glasgow. The band stated that they are self-producing the album and have their own studio to record in. Recording finished on January 13, 2008.

&gt; On February 22, 2008, they played a small show for fans at Queen Margaret Union to debut new songs from the upcoming album. About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. The first single from the album was called ""Mistress Mabel"" and was released on May 26, 2008. The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd. The Fratellis released a deluxe edition of Here We Stand internationally on December the 8th. The CD includes a new song titled 'Moriarty's Last Stand' and the accompanying DVD includes ""The Year Of The Thief"" (A documentary of the band on the road in the US); A live show filmed on June 18th 2008 at the Fillmore, San Francisco; performances of Milk and Money, Flathead and Mistress Mabel from Abbey Road Studios and the videos for the singles Mistress Mabel and Look Out Sunshine!
On April, 22 2010, both singer Jon Lawler and bassist Barry Wallace posted messages on their forum saying the band are unlikely to record together again soon.

&gt; The Fratellis have announced during June 2012 that they have decided to reform to help raise money for The Eilidh Brown Memorial Fund on the 15th of June at the MacRobert Centre in Stirling. The band plans on announcing more dates for later in the year.
The band then announced an extensive UK tour during December 2012 to take place in April 2013. During the UK tour, 3 more songs were debuted live; ""She's Not Gone Yet (But She's Leaving), Seven Days and Whiskey Saga.
On February 4th 2013, The Fratellis announced they had finished recording their third album, which was revealed to be called We Need Medicine with a release date of October 7th 2013. ""Seven Nights Seven Days"" was released as a single on September 29th. The album was recorded in Glasgow with Jon Fratelli and Stuart McCredie on production duties.

&gt; On the 24th of April 2013 it was announced that The Fratellis would be headlining Brownstock Festival in Essex on Sunday the 1st of September.

&gt; On the 22nd June 2013 The Fratellis headlined New College Commemoration Ball, a white-tie Ball set in the grounds of New College, Oxford.

&gt; The time is now for one of the industry’s best-kept secrets: PJ Morton. The Maroon 5 keyboardist/ backing vocalist makes his major label debut on May 14 with New Orleans, his first album for Young Money Entertainment/Cash Money Records. One listen to Morton’s anticipated project quickly reveals why the multi-talent became a favorite on the indie R&amp;B circuit and an in-demand songwriter/producer and also why the limitless talent will be a game changer for the Lil Wayne-founded Young Money.

&gt; New Orleans marks the Cash Money imprint’s first step toward broadening its already wide appeal, thanks to a hit-making and award-winning roster that includes founder Lil Wayne, Drake and Nicki Minaj. And there’s no better ambassador to musically personify that message than Morton, whose self described “soulful pop” seamlessly spans multiple genres from gospel and R&amp;B/funk to pop and rock.

&gt; “I’ve always pushed boundaries,” says Morton, “but I always remain true to who I am musically. New Orleans is a natural progression of who I am. I can’t explain it except through my music. That proves it better than anything I can say.”

&gt; Building that case is “Only One” featuring Stevie Wonder. Quickly garnering strong reaction following its January premiere on Billboard.com, the song is the lead single from New Orleans. Armed with an infectious hook and a head-boppin’ groove, the up-tempo number showcases Morton’s velvety tenor, songwriting skills and musicianship, accented by Wonder’s distinctive harmonica.

&gt; “Stevie joining me on the track is the ultimate start. It’s my dream come true,” says Morton of teaming with Wonder. “I want to continue the legacy he represents: musicianship and positivity.”

&gt; New Orleans itself stems from Morton’s acclaimed 2012 EP, Following My First Mind, featuring guest cameos from Maroon 5’s Adam Levine, Lil Wayne and Jazmine Sullivan. A nod to Morton’s hometown and musical roots, the forthcoming New Orleans finds Morton at the keyboard playing with a full backing band complete with horns and strings. The result is a lush, melodic yet organic 10-track set that grabs listeners right from the opening title track.

&gt; “New Orleans is where I learned how to play music,” recalls Morton. “It’s the physical and mind space I was in when I fell in love with music. It wasn’t about marketing, radio and publicity. It was just about making music because I loved it. It made me feel good. Young Money wanted me creatively as I am. That’s why I’m excited about this next chapter.”

&gt; Also featuring rapper Busta Rhymes, New Orleans comes packed with a diverse slate of musical influences. There’s the reggae-infused “Hard Enough,” which explores relationship issues. “I’m looking for a love unconditional / Not one that goes wherever the wind blows,” declares Morton as the song opens.

&gt; The self-described “Dr. Love” traverses the same landscape on the mid-tempo “Work It Out.” Set off by a touch of synth and a hypnotic drumbeat, the song once again spotlights Morton’s tantalizing tenor. Also noteworthy is “Heavy,” a song revamped from Morton’s 2012 EP and featuring Adam Levine. Sporting a funk/rock track reminiscent of Sly Stone and Prince, the song’s lyrics were inspired by Morton’s frustration at one point with his indie career.

&gt; “It was at a point where I was trying to figure out what the next step was,” says Morton, who hadn’t yet connected with pop hitmakers Maroon 5. “This was me getting those feelings out. Since that frustration, I’ve had one of the biggest years in my career. It’s crazy.”

&gt; Influenced by acts ranging from the Beatles and James Taylor to Wonder and Donny Hathaway, the New Orleans native is the son of gospel singer Paul S. Morton. His formal foray into the industry was as a member of the band Freestyle Nation, which debuted in the early 2000s. But it was as a songwriter/ producer that Morton left his first indelible impression. He won a Grammy Award for his songwriting/ production of India.Arie’s “Interested” from her 2002 album Voyage to India.

&gt; That opened the door to more collaborations (Jermaine Dupri, LL Cool J, Monica, Musiq Soulchild, Trinitee 5:7) and additional accolades (Dove and Stellar Awards) for his work with gospel singer DeWayne Woods. Woods’ “Let Go, Let God” spent a record 70 weeks on the gospel chart. Along the way, Morton released several acclaimed indie solo albums. He also attracted the attention of Academy Award-winning producer AR Rahman (“Slumdog Millionaire”), who asked Morton to contribute a song (“Sajna”) to the soundtrack for the Vince Vaughn comedy “Couples Retreat.”

&gt; Morton’s next big break occurred three years ago, when he was asked to audition by friend and Maroon
5 music director Adam Blackstone for a spot in the band as its keyboardist/vocalist. Soon after, childhood friend and Young Money Entertainment president Mack Maine championed Morton’s music and vision to Cash Money co-CEO’s Roland “Slim” Williams and Bryan “Birdman” Williams. With Lil Wayne co-signing his approval as well, Morton is ready to bring his journey full circle with New Orleans.

&gt; “My indie years and working with various artists, including Maroon 5, have helped me understand who I am as both an individual and an artist,” says Morton. “It has allowed me to create a fan base that will forever be with me. Now I’m being given the opportunity to do on steroids what I’ve been doing for years.” Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; A London, UK production &amp; remix team. Formed from the ashes of Simian in 2005 its members are James Ford and Jas Shaw. In addition to his work with Simian Mobile Disco, James Ford is a producer and has worked for bands such as the Arctic Monkeys, Peaches and Klaxons.

&gt; Simian Mobile Disco was originally formed as a traveling DJ duet, playing on the side of their early four-piece band Simian. They ultimately released a number of low profile singles, such as ""The Count"" on Kitsuné Music, but arguably gained more fame for their remixes of artists such as Muse, Klaxons, The Go! Team, Air and others. In 2006, Kitsuné released SMD's underground hit ""Hustler"", which features a vocal performance from New York singer Char Johnson.

&gt; Musically, Simian Mobile Disco is known for heavily stylized tracks —often with minimal instrumentation— that associate themselves with a particular hook (vocal or instrumental —see mix of ""Whoo! Alright, Yeah...Uh Huh"" by The Rapture), which is repeated throughout the track. There is often a breakdown (occasionally more —see mix of ""Magick"" by Klaxons) comprising noise, drums and sometimes synths and vocals.

&gt; The band's debut album, Attack Decay Sustain Release was released on 18 June 2007 on Wichita Recordings. Among the tracks included on it are ""Hustler"", ""Tits and Acid"", ""I Believe"", ""Hot Dog"" and lead single ""It's the Beat"", which features Ninja from UK indie band The Go! Team on vocals. The album contains five new tracks, and the European version includes a bonus disc. The album was preceded by two mix compilations in April and May, for the ""Bugged Out"" and ""Go Commando"" series respectively.

&gt; SMD supported Klaxons at Brixton Academy on the 5 December 2007 and The Chemical Brothers at Aintree Pavilion on 9 December 2007 and Brighton Centre on 12 December 2007. SMD made a mix for Mixmag that came free with the January 2008 issue of Mixmag. While working on their second studio album, they released a collection of remixed SMD originals entitled Sample and Hold, which contains eleven tracks and was released in the UK on July 28, 2008. A North American date has not yet been announced.

&gt; In January 2009, they announced on their Myspace page that a new album was supposed to come out in 2009. Soon after that, they released a new track ""Synthesise"", on 12 February, through a music video (directed by Kate Moross and Alex Sushon) that ""features live visual accompaniment"" for the track. Two days later, a new song was broadcast on the BBC Radio 1 named ""10,000 Horses Can't Be Wrong"", soon followed by the release on 6 March of the official music video on their YouTube channel.

&gt; Their sophomore studio album Temporary Pleasure was finally announced on the 6 May, featuring many guests that they have encountered by their work as producers or their worldly tour including Gruff Rhys of Super Furry Animals, Alexis Taylor of Hot Chip, Beth Ditto of Gossip, and Chris Keating of Yeasayer.

&gt; On New Years Eve 2009 Simian Mobile Disco will headline 'Get Loaded in the Dark' at the world famous Brixton Academy alongside Annie Mac (BBC Radio 1), Chase &amp; Status, Herve and Sub Focus.

Did I miss any? Oh man, totally forgot about Fueled by Ramen. The Academy Is, Days Away, Slick Shoes, Phantom Planet, Recover, The Hush Sound. I wasn't a fan of *all* of the bands I listed in my previous post, but mentioned names I used to listen to, bands that were around in that era. This is a memory trip for me. That scene was my end all/be all for like three years. Went to tons of shows in the SoCal area, which was an awesome place to live during that scene. Then I discovered Coachella and indie music around 2004 and it was pretty quickly over. And yeah Pedro is definitely indie. Just one that I got into around that time. Something Corporate was my absolute favorite band. Saw them so many times when they were just starting to get popular. When KROQ was *just* starting to play them. But then that whole scene took off into the mainstream and I couldn't really keep up/afford it. But those bands were blowing up so quickly around that time. I remember wanting to see Brand New and Taking Back Sunday at the Troubadour for like $25 and that was a little bit too expensive for me and then next thing I know they're playing places like the Palladium and even big arenas. But I'd say my favorite bands of that era were Something Corporate, Finch, Jimmy Eat World, Taking Back Sunday, Brand New, Thursday, Thrice, and Dashboard.

Well, calling it a ""big movement"" in comparison to the ones that came before it is a bit of an overstatement, but it was what we grew up with as teenagers in the mid-2000s. And Decaydance was just the label leading the charge. Fall Out Boy was the biggest. Their music was incredibly catchy, Patrick Stump was an amazing vocalist, and Pete wrote really catchy (if a bit angsty) lyrics. And there was definitely a sort of pretentious aspect to it but in a really fun, cheeky way. Listen to the first PatD album, for example. The lyrics are full of references to Chuck Palahniuk (author Fight Club, Invisible Monsters, Choke, etc.) and cult movies. And just look at the song titles on the early FOB and PatD albums--they're so long you can barely remember them.

And each of those bands brought something unique to the table. Fall Out Boy became overly theatrical, especially around the time of Infinity on High, and experimented with a lot of cool sounds. Panic ditched the whole pop punk thing on their second album and became a Beatles/Beach Boys imitator (and Pretty.Odd. is one of the best albums of that decade for it!). The Academy Is... was arguably the third biggest band on the label. They kind of blew it--they went super pop punk (emphasis on the pop) with their third album (which was GREAT!) but then self-destructed soon after. Gym Class Heroes were also really cool--a much more pop-oriented style of rap rock than we were used to seeing at the time. And then of course there was The Hush Sound, one of my favourite bands of all time (Greta Salpeter is one of my top 10 fav musicians ever and I can't recommend her solo project Springtime Carnivore enough), who made very catchy, very well-written jangle indie pop. And while I'm on the subject, I must mention Hey Monday, who I love to death. They were kind of Paramore-lite, but 10 times as catchy imo. Cassadee Pope, the lead singer, now does solo country stuff.

But yeah. Decaydance was so huge that any band signed to the label would gain some of that popularity. Others include Cobra Starship (who were also quite huge--the Snakes on a Plane song is classic), The Cab (very solid debut, a shame they never really went anywhere), and, for some inexplicable reason, Tyga. 

So, to answer your question, looking at them as a ""section of pop music"" or as ""anti-pop stars"" doesn't tell the whole story. That is what FOB and PatD have become nowadays after a HUGE shift in musical direction they underwent. But to understand the origin of popularity, you have to go back to a time when rock music was still a huge force to be reckoned with and they were some of the biggest stars around.",,,,,False,False,[],False,,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",,,False,,True,t3_al0drn,,,,/r/popheads/comments/al0drn/can_someone_explain_the_phenomenon_of_bands_like/efa0b7e/,public,,,,,,1548783135.0,r/popheads,0,,,,,,1426198747.0,,,1552217031.0,,,

&gt; Glen Hansard (born 21 April 1970) is an Irish singer-songwriter and actor. He is vocalist and guitarist for Irish group  The Frames and one half of folk-rock duo The Swell Season.

&gt; Hansard is said to have quit school at age 13 to begin busking on local Dublin streets. He first came to public attention as guitar player 'Outspan Foster' in the Alan Parker film The Commitments, a role he subsequently regretted, believing it distracted from his music career. In 2003 he presented the first series of Other Voices: Songs from a Room, which showcased Irish music talent on RTÉ. The album The Swell Season, in collaboration with a Czech singer and multi-instrumentalist Markéta Irglová, was released on in 2006 (the album also featured Marja Tuhkanen and Bertrand Galen).

&gt; Hansard starred in the movie 'Once' alongside Markéta Irglová which won a prestigious Sundance Audience Award in 2007, as well as the 2008 Academy Award for Best Original Song (for ""Falling Slowly""), beating three songs from the Disney musical ""Enchanted"" and one song from ""August Rush"" (both were heavy contenders). Its Irish release took place on 23rd March 2007 and appeared in cinemas further afield later in the year.

&gt; Hansard's album, Rhythm and Repose, was released in June 2012. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Czech formation Ohm Square was founded by Jan Čechtický with Dušan Lipert and Jan Kleník in 1996, in times of first attempts on electronic dance music field, following their occurance in Prague's indie groups Sebastians, Colorfactory (Dušan, Jan2) a Hyena Family (Jan5).

&gt; Shortly after recording of a first few tracks, they invited to Prague a singer of a cult house hit 'Petal' from London's Wubble-U, Charlie One. She stayed with Ohm Square and after several years of cooperation on the Prague-London route she moved to Czech Republic permanently. Since 1996 Ohm Square play together in the same formation: Jan2 (Jan Čechtický), Jan5 (Jan Kleník), Dušan Only One (Dušan Lipert) a Charlie One (Charlotte).

&gt; Ohm Square, dedicated at the time mostly to d'n'b and breakbeat, published their first vinyl single with sings Pillow and Coloured Post in 1996 under their own label, Mr. Cucumber. In 1997 they had a first concert in Prague's Roxy club. At the end of year Ohm Square released a debut album Ohmophonica (Next Era), licensed later by MFS (Paul van Dyk, beside others) in Germany. Choice of their song 'Pillow' on prestigious compilation DJ Kicks (produced by singer Nicolette from Massive Attack) was significant. Readers of Czech magazine Rock &amp; Pop selected Ohmophonica as the record of the year. In summer 1997 they played on tour with british Dubstar, one of a few Ohm Square tours in Czech Republic. Despite being always more of a studio group, Ohm Square opened for Apollo 440 in Brumlovka (Prague). In the first half of 1998 they add a drummer Láďa Pecha (Načeva), and famous czech d'n'b DJ Koogi to their live appearances. In 1998 they play mainly in Holland, Germany, Switzerland, and Czech Republic and slowly start to collect material for a next album.

&gt; Recording of the second CD Scion was started in their own Prague studio, Eastauthentic, and continued in Wubble-U's London studio Strange Weather. The album was produced by Duncan Forbes from Spooky. After the release of Scion in 1999, Ohm Square gives another european tour, thanks to production company Zjelva Pro Motion. At home they receive Popular Music Academy's Angel award in 1999 and 2000, and listeners of Prague alternative Radio 1 choosed Ohm Square best group of the decade.

&gt; In 2001 Ohm Square members release remix album under their Eastauthentic label, and start to produce their own songs and projects, such as Dentist, Vindaloo, Eky, eky, eky, eky ta pang (Jan2, Charlie one), Mimoň, Default (Dušan Only One), or Skleník (Jan5). They're not opposed to cooperation with other interprets and produce recordings for Dara Rollins (Jan5), Lenka Dusilová, Chaozz (Dušan Only One), 100°C (Jan2), and others. Charlotte appears as a guest singer on records of czech and international projects (DJ Tráva, Juanita Juarez, Nathan Coles...) and becomes one of the most significant persons on Czech dance scene. Since the very beginning, Ohm Square are film maker's favourites, so only a few of recent movies doesn't feature a composition of theirs (Samotáři, Divoké včely, Děvčátko...). Some movies have even their whole original score (Eliška má ráda divočinu, Anděl exit - Jan2); in some they appear on the screen in person (Šeptej, Knoflíkáři, Anděl exit - Jan2, Tmavomodrý svět - Charlie one).

Hailee Steinfeld, extraordinary actress known for being among the youngest people nominated for an Academy Award, took a break from her thriving acting career to take a swing at music. While it worked out for her bigger hits, this one, aided by everyone’s favourite music duo Florida Georgia Line, did not do as well, peaking at 40 on the hot 100. I think the main problem is that it it just doesn’t do anything particularly exciting - the buildup to the drop is anthemic and fun, but the release just isn’t there. The muffled synths just aren’t enough to stand out positively, especially in a rate full of much more exciting drops.

#Haileegot

**1998tweety** (10): A massive bop, I love the chorus with multiple vocal lines on it, makes it feel a lot bigger. This song absolutely deserves day 3 but you cause have awful taste and hate jerk FGL so it'll be lucky to make day 2. The way Hailee ends the song is bittersweet.

**animefangrant62** (10): , haileEGOT strikes again with another big bop, this time featuring those silk tongued gods known as Florida Georgia Line

**Bendariaku89** (10): look, I FUCK WITH THIS SONG, though i can understand why one wouldn’t. it does have that sort of unneeded EDM drop. it has that vibe which most people associate with generic. for me though, i just relate to this song’s message. having that knowledge that i’m making a relationship awful and i just wish my other partner would just realize that or just find someone more healthy than me to be friends with but our relationship’s still there and i just wanna blast this song at them, and tell them to be happy and WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU STILL FRIENDS WITH ME WHEN YOU COMPARE YOURSELF TO ME SO MUCH THAT IT HURTS YOU DEEP ENOUGH TO HAVE DEPRESSION I WANNA HELP BUT ITS ALL LOSE/LOSE... ahem. anyway, that sentiment just hits me deep and that’s why i just love this song. the beat legit makes me wanna dance just wearing underwear and a hoodie on a car i don’t even own in the rain at the side of a cliff t-swift style while i cry a little too much. the vibe is just too good. also hailee sounds beautiful. WATCH BUMBLEEBEE. STREAM BACK TO YOU. THANKS FOR READING AND LISTENING TO MY TED TALK ON LET ME GO. (this isn’t my 11 tho ‘cause run on love fucking dethroned her)

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this is giving me Bebe Rexha + Florida Georgia Line where the artists collabing just have me like “??????”

**timothy444** (9.2): I would’ve preferred if the song had different male vocalists but Florida Georgia Line doesn’t ruin it at all. It’s just a bit jarring seeing this EDM and country crossover work so well. The melody also isn’t generic and straightforward and has this country-like feel that overplay hasn’t killed at all. A murderous bop.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): why is this good? it has no right to be, it just... is.

**HerculesMeow** (9): I'd never heard this song before but I really liked it! I normally dislike FGL but they sounded good on this too

**ManofOranges** (9): You know I really like this song but like the chorus sounds like a wheezing robot and I really just don't know who decided that but they shouldn't have.

**Me-Luigi** (9): This is such a weird but lovely collab, watt really snapped - still funny to me that Bebe Rexha suggested FGL to be on this, they work quite well for a lil verse, the distorted guitar drop live in some performances was IT

**PuggleMaster** (9): FGL actually sound good on this. Not sure how Alesso did that but congrats!

**ramskick** (9): just to piss Q off for the most part because he hates FGL (love you Q)

**vhqv1997** (9): I like this song, but I feel like they smashed three different songs together and it only worked by sheer luck

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): haileegot won, why is watt credited on this tho

**notdallin** (8.1): LONG LIVE TROPICAL HOUSE. WHERE 👏 THAT 👏 ALBUM 👏 ALESSO 👏

**camerinian** (7.5): I wish the verses were more interesting, and Florida Georgia LIne just straight up didn’t exist, because my god what a hook. Absolute belter of a tune

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): the chorus is cool

**sbb618** (7.5): Love the chorus (or even just the transition from verse to chorus), but not really the rest of the song.

**yatcho** (7.3): Cant believe i kind of like a midtempo edm song featuring Florida Georgia Line... my absolute lack of taste omg

**singularlegend** (7): Hailee underrated mom

**vulture\_couture** (7): The chorus is very fun and FGL actually fit the song somewhat well!

#Florida Georgia Line enthusiasts

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7.5): this is an alesso song indeed

**Chevsapher** (7): There are too many vocalists on this track, and although the production is solid, it's not enough to lure me in.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): It’s okay I guess. Feels like it’s just a radio song though and nothing else.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Florida Georgia Line are my favorite women

**monkeyattacks** (7): Meh Hailee and Alesso make this song

**awryj** (6): eh

**Brandon6099** (6): bops decently, pretty generic (sorry ly Hailee &lt;3)

**CritneySpearz** (6): Hailee is a queen but FGL is trash

**diamondblaze413** (6): second drop is really nice but fgl literally wrote half an already short verse

**evilqueenlex** (6): I hear this song all the time but never heard the intro so at first I was like ""ooh I'm going to like this song"" and then i heard that familiar ""I'VE BEEN HOPING..."" and was like ugh not this song. I never listened to this song in its entirety so I mean at least I know for sure I don't like it. This song gets a 6 for Hailee's vocals and that intro.

**golden\_bassnectar** (6): the song would be way better without FGL

**MashLuke** (6): this is fine really, it does what it does.

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): It's a shame we're just limiting this rate to main pop girls, because if we didn't, we could have included more Avicii, who actually had country-influenced EDM hits worth listening to; most unfortunately, the words 'Florida Georgia Line' and 'good' are completely incompatible, unless you add a 'riddance' at the end.

**piccprincess** (6): SHUT UP AND--

**seralite** (6): ehhh its ok

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): this is probably the only acceptable thing Florida Georgia alone has ever done

**bbfan132** (5.7): the vocals/vocal editing is…. :S also, boring production does not earn any points from me

**frogaranaman** (5): Reminds me of puking.

**GamblesWithDesire** (5): This song was a solid 7 before FGL came in, because they both don't fit the song and are there for like 20 seconds.

**Leixander** (5): a collab that doesn't work!

**MrSwearword** (5): oh look Florida Georgia Line ruins something; SHOCKER

**selegend** (5): Would be 10x better without FGL tbh

**Johnnytoby** (4.5): Hailey has done better

**SinfulAnarchy** (4.5): I used to like this song, but now, every time it plays on my local radio station, I internally groan. it sounds super derivative and formulaic, and the beat is annoying. lyrics are also generic trash.

**Adorable\_Raccoon** (4): i do not like her indie girl impression or the chorus effect in the chorus. It's only a year old but it sounds dated.

**bespectacIed** (4): Cute chorus

**marcryan** (4): 4 for the 4 artists in the song

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (4): That synth in the drop is unsettling

**tapdancingpig** (4): Eh. Just... boring. Cliched hook, boring drop, uninteresting-but-competent vocalist (Hailey Steinfeld, not FGL. If it weren’t for the country fuckers, I would have given it a 5).

**twat\_brained** (4): This is an Alesso song? This can't be the same man behind ""More Than You Know"". Well, one major difference here is that there's a total nobody in Watt, on the track, compared to Seb Ingrosso, 1/3 of perhaps the greatest dance band since Daft Punk, and a Hailee Steinfeld who sounds marginally less lifeless than she did on ""Starving"". And Florida Georgia Line, of all people, is on the track somehow. Why? Frankly, my dears, I don't give a damn. In fact, it seems the only person who did was Hailee on the chorus. If nothing else, I give her credit for that.

**xxrandooxx** (4): there's alot goin on in this

**radiofan15** (3.7): I like Hailee and wish her the best but yikes... this is more generic than a Lil Baby and Gunna deep cut

**LandonKidatrea** (3): Florida Georgia Line are my fave pop girls.

**skargardin** (3): personality lost

**SkyBlade79** (2): the drop hurts my head so much

**enecks** (1): Forget Meant To Be - this is the real enemy.

**lilguavachan** (1): fuck you alesso. the drop is just dreadful, hailee... gurl go back to acting or whatever you did before your wet fart of a music career, and i'm not going to address the others in this song because that would mean having to acknowledge that they exist in some capacity and i'm not going to do that to myself, thank you.

**mich4725** (1): Just meh, those vocal chopped hooks are so overused

&gt; Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band formed in Bolton, Greater Manchester, UK in 1976, led by singer-songwriter and guitarist Pete Shelley (1955 – 2018) for nearly their entire existence.

&gt; They are commonly regarded as an important influence on the Manchester music scene, the independent record label movement and the punk rock, power pop, pop punk and indie rock genres in general. They are primarily remembered for their singles, a string of would-be hits that combined a strong grasp of pop song craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy. These singles were collected on Singles Going Steady, described by critic Ned Raggett as a ""punk masterpiece"" The widely covered ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" remains one of their best-known songs.

&gt; The name ""Buzzcocks"" partially comes from the Manchester slang term cock meaning youngster, and its use in the 1970s ITV drama serial Rock Follies which included the catch phrases ""that's the buzz, cocks"" and ""give me a buzz, cock!""

&gt; Buzzcocks were one of the key first generation British punk rock bands to form in the wake of the Sex Pistols in 1976. They were founded by Mancunians Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto, however Devoto left soon after the group released their Spiral Scratch EP (on their own independent label), leaving Shelley to take over vocals. 

&gt; They are best known for their catchy, poppy punk sound, which has been widely influential, which was adopted as Peter Shelley took over on the vocals, singing about what the whole punk rock scene opted not to sing about: love. Devoto in the meanwhile formed Magazine.

&gt; They rehearsed in a friend's kitchen and played at the all-day 100 club punk ""festival"", in London. At the end of 1977 the band signed to United Artists and released ""Orgasm Addict"", with Shelley's high-pitched vocal delivery and Ramones-esque fuzz-guitar sound ensuring the controversial single would be played over again. Later came ""What Do I Get?"" which hit the UK charts and showed Shelley's brilliance in songwriting.

&gt; An LP was then released, Another Music in a Different Kitchen which came with its own carrier bag, labelled ""Product"". In 1978-79 five chart-hitting singles were released including ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" and had captured a pop-loving audience by this time. Love Bites, their second LP was released later on, which had less excitement than the last album, though it did sell well, with Steve Diggle taking over lyric-writing.

&gt; October 1979 saw A Different Kind of Tension which was panned by some critics, quite unfairly, as it contains some excellent songs, the title track being the stand-out. It perhaps suffered from being the second album to be released that year, with the record company keen to capitalise on the band's chart success at the time. 

&gt; 3 more singles followed in 1980, but the spark had clearly gone out for a while. Musical differences and the long slog behind them led to the band splitting in early 1981. Pete Shelley embarked in a solo career.. 

&gt; He released three dance/electronic influenced solo albums: Homosapien, XL1 and Heaven and The Sea - all with the same fine songwriting skills. Meanwhile, Steve Diggle formed Flag of Convenience - a power pop combo -  and toured with some success. 

&gt; A 5 album/CD set was released in 1989 called Product, which contained all the albums to date, plus the greatest hits and B sides album, Singles Going Steady, and the last non-album singles, Why She's A Girl From the Chainstore, Airwaves Dream and Running Free, plus the B sides

&gt; In 1992 the Buzzcocks reformed, without original drummer John Maher and bassist Steve Garvey, and releasd Trade Test Transmissions in 1993, quite different from their earlier material, with nods to the power pop scene popular at the time. All Set in 1996 saw a return to form with familiar riffs and pin sharp lyrics pop-punk. Next year Chronology was released, the missing album, including outtakes from the three United Artists albums.  In 1999 they released Modern, which saw Shelley in reflective mode and Steve Diggle taking over more of the vocal duties.

&gt; Then followed another brief break in 2000, with Shelley teaming up with old band-mate Howard Devoto to release a largely disappointing album, Buzzkunst. Compilations followed, including Inventory in 2003, which contained every single to date, and 30 in 2005 to celebrate 30 years performing

&gt; 2005 saw the Buzzcocks back touring and in 2007 they released the superb Flat Pack Philosophy, widely agreed to rank up with the best of Buzzcocks output

&gt; 2008/9 saw a short tour where the band played tracks from Another Music and Love Bites.

&gt; In August 2011 they headlined the first night of The Rhythm Festival in Bedfordshire.

&gt; In November 2011 it was announced they would be playing two shows in 2012 that would feature the original line-up as well as the classic line-up of the band reunited for the first time in many years; these shows took place on 25 May 2012 in Manchester at the O2 Apollo and on 26 May in Brixton at the O2 Academy. It was announced on 26 May 2012 that, for the first time, they would headline Thursday night in the Empress Ballroom at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool sharing the stage with the likes of Rancid, Public Image Limited and Social Distortion.

&gt; On 1 May 2014 Buzzcocks released the album The Way via PledgeMusic. On 13 September 2014 Buzzcocks played ""a brief but triumphant set"" at Riot Fest 2014 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. In October 2014 Buzzcocks toured the U.K. for three weeks with The Dollyrots as main support.

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD ""Edgy In Brixton"" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London. The DVD contains a full live performance of the debut album Costello Music, B-Sides from various singles and a new song called Pretty Like a Girl. Extras on the DVD include the band being asked questions by members of The Fratellis' website, and on the deluxe edition, highlights from the T In The Park 2007 festival. It was released in the United States on the 30 October 2007

&gt; 2007-2008: Here We Stand

&gt; On November 20, 2007, it was announced on the Fratellis' official website that work had begun on the second album in rehearsal space in Glasgow. The band stated that they are self-producing the album and have their own studio to record in. Recording finished on January 13, 2008.

&gt; On February 22, 2008, they played a small show for fans at Queen Margaret Union to debut new songs from the upcoming album. About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. The first single from the album was called ""Mistress Mabel"" and was released on May 26, 2008. The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd. The Fratellis released a deluxe edition of Here We Stand internationally on December the 8th. The CD includes a new song titled 'Moriarty's Last Stand' and the accompanying DVD includes ""The Year Of The Thief"" (A documentary of the band on the road in the US); A live show filmed on June 18th 2008 at the Fillmore, San Francisco; performances of Milk and Money, Flathead and Mistress Mabel from Abbey Road Studios and the videos for the singles Mistress Mabel and Look Out Sunshine!
On April, 22 2010, both singer Jon Lawler and bassist Barry Wallace posted messages on their forum saying the band are unlikely to record together again soon.

&gt; The Fratellis have announced during June 2012 that they have decided to reform to help raise money for The Eilidh Brown Memorial Fund on the 15th of June at the MacRobert Centre in Stirling. The band plans on announcing more dates for later in the year.
The band then announced an extensive UK tour during December 2012 to take place in April 2013. During the UK tour, 3 more songs were debuted live; ""She's Not Gone Yet (But She's Leaving), Seven Days and Whiskey Saga.
On February 4th 2013, The Fratellis announced they had finished recording their third album, which was revealed to be called We Need Medicine with a release date of October 7th 2013. ""Seven Nights Seven Days"" was released as a single on September 29th. The album was recorded in Glasgow with Jon Fratelli and Stuart McCredie on production duties.

&gt; On the 24th of April 2013 it was announced that The Fratellis would be headlining Brownstock Festival in Essex on Sunday the 1st of September.

&gt; On the 22nd June 2013 The Fratellis headlined New College Commemoration Ball, a white-tie Ball set in the grounds of New College, Oxford.

Anyone who heard Ben Howard’s late-night guest slot on Radio 1 earlier this week would have gathered pretty quickly that the 31-year-old singer-songwriter is not your average rock star. Speaking in hushed and hesitant tones, Richmond-born Howard played music from cult American folkie Chris Smither, avant-garde cellist Arthur Russell and Eighties experimentalists Talk Talk. Mainstream it most certainly wasn’t.

Having won two Brit awards in 2013 for his hazy indie-folk, Howard has followed his musical muse down the road less travelled with admirable conviction. His third album, Noonday Dream, released last June, was a dreamlike collection of musically intricate songs that delved inwards as much as his contemporary Ed Sheeran’s songs have gone the other way and reached outwards for maximum appeal.

Yet, despite having a public profile as low key as his music, Howard remains extremely popular. His first night of a four-night residency at London’s Brixton Academy showed that there’s mileage in woozy melancholia. In a blue artist’s smock, Howard took to a stage interspersed with 10 lighting poles, giving the impression of a gig among stalagmites or hanging vines. We were somewhere else. Somewhere exotic.

The opener, Nica Libres at Dusk, set the tone. Slowly pulsing, the music swooned and swooped in and out of focus. The murmured lyrics were fragmentary, suggesting summer sunsets and eagles soaring in perpetual circles. All evening, Howard’s music created a feeling of being adrift. Images of islands, coves, the sea and the moon were constantly conjured.

The nine-piece backing band, including two drummers and a string section, were intense and match-fit, having toured constantly since last summer. On songs such as What The Moon Does, their textures hypnotised. However, given the spaced-out nature of the music, I occasionally wondered what quite so many musicians were actually doing. Perhaps this was the sonic equivalent of Dolly Parton’s maxim about it costing “a lot of money to look this cheap”: it takes a lot of musicians to sound this sparse. Either way, they were often mesmeric, particularly on main set closer Murmurations.

There were things wrong with this gig: there was only one song from Howard’s popular Brit-era, whereas we got every single track from Noonday Dream; over the evening, I think I interacted more with my nearby seat attendant than Howard did with the audience; and Howard occasionally wore his influences too heavily. (His beloved Radiohead were in evidence everywhere, and the song Towing The Line sounded so much like a Neil Young track that I barely slept a wink post-show trying to place it. I think it’s Distant Camera, but I’m still not sure.)

But here’s the thing. There’s something warmly reassuring about the nature of Howard’s success. He proves that you don’t have to be an on-stage showboater, a gossip column regular, an Instagram megastar or indeed a critical darling – Noonday Dream failed to make the album of the year lists in Q, NME, Pitchfork or Rolling Stone – to garner a sizeable and loyal following. All it takes is interesting music that resonates with people, however opaque that music may be.

&gt; Mission of Burma is an American post-punk band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1979. The band was formed by Roger Miller (guitar), Clint Conley (bass), Peter Prescott (drums) and Martin Swope (tape manipulator/sound engineer). Miller, Conley and Prescott share singing and songwriting duties. Like many of their post-punk contemporaries, Mission of Burma's efforts are largely concerned with extending punk's original vocabulary without losing its essential rebellious spirit. Using rapid shifts in dynamics, unconventional time signatures and chord progressions along with tape effects, Mission of Burma challenges the prevailing idioms of punk while attempting to retain its power and immediacy.

&gt; In early years the band's audience was limited to the Boston area, with all their recordings released on the small Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. The band released only one album in its original form, Vs.. Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope, and has since recorded two more albums, ONoffON and The Obliterati.

&gt; Their wall-of-noise musical sound extended the vocabulary of punk while continuing to hold clear its sense of power and abandon.  They used a number of tape effects, different chord progressions, and time shifts to highlight their formal training in music.  Not only that but they are seen now as a highly influential band to both post-punk and experimental music to come after; many bands cite Burma as an inspiration, including Nirvana, Superchunk, Creed, The Grifters, R.E.M. (who regularly covered ""Academy Fight Song"" on their Green tour), Sonic Youth, Throwing Muses, Yo La Tengo, Soul Asylum, Pixies, Sugar, Catherine Wheel, Guided by Voices, Graham Coxon and Moby - the last two of which have covered """"That's When I Reach For My Revolver.""

&gt; The band were due to tour in 1980 with Joy Division but the suicide of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's singer, canceled the tour. In 1983, after releasing their only full-length studio record Vs., the group disbanded due to Miller's worsening tinnitus.

&gt; The band found increasing relevance throughout the 90s, culminating in the publication of Michael Azzerad's essays Our Band Could Be Your Life which featured Mission of Burma. In 2002, they reunited and began playing reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and formerly Prescott's Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller relates that ""when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin's position, we told him he could use current digital technology which accomplishes Martin's antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted for maintaining the original integrity, and uses a tape deck.""

&gt; Janelle Monáe (born Janelle Monáe Robinson on December 1, 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and performer.

&gt;  She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

&gt; The time is now for one of the industry’s best-kept secrets: PJ Morton. The Maroon 5 keyboardist/ backing vocalist makes his major label debut on May 14 with New Orleans, his first album for Young Money Entertainment/Cash Money Records. One listen to Morton’s anticipated project quickly reveals why the multi-talent became a favorite on the indie R&amp;B circuit and an in-demand songwriter/producer and also why the limitless talent will be a game changer for the Lil Wayne-founded Young Money.

&gt; New Orleans marks the Cash Money imprint’s first step toward broadening its already wide appeal, thanks to a hit-making and award-winning roster that includes founder Lil Wayne, Drake and Nicki Minaj. And there’s no better ambassador to musically personify that message than Morton, whose self described “soulful pop” seamlessly spans multiple genres from gospel and R&amp;B/funk to pop and rock.

&gt; “I’ve always pushed boundaries,” says Morton, “but I always remain true to who I am musically. New Orleans is a natural progression of who I am. I can’t explain it except through my music. That proves it better than anything I can say.”

&gt; Building that case is “Only One” featuring Stevie Wonder. Quickly garnering strong reaction following its January premiere on Billboard.com, the song is the lead single from New Orleans. Armed with an infectious hook and a head-boppin’ groove, the up-tempo number showcases Morton’s velvety tenor, songwriting skills and musicianship, accented by Wonder’s distinctive harmonica.

&gt; “Stevie joining me on the track is the ultimate start. It’s my dream come true,” says Morton of teaming with Wonder. “I want to continue the legacy he represents: musicianship and positivity.”

&gt; New Orleans itself stems from Morton’s acclaimed 2012 EP, Following My First Mind, featuring guest cameos from Maroon 5’s Adam Levine, Lil Wayne and Jazmine Sullivan. A nod to Morton’s hometown and musical roots, the forthcoming New Orleans finds Morton at the keyboard playing with a full backing band complete with horns and strings. The result is a lush, melodic yet organic 10-track set that grabs listeners right from the opening title track.

&gt; “New Orleans is where I learned how to play music,” recalls Morton. “It’s the physical and mind space I was in when I fell in love with music. It wasn’t about marketing, radio and publicity. It was just about making music because I loved it. It made me feel good. Young Money wanted me creatively as I am. That’s why I’m excited about this next chapter.”

&gt; Also featuring rapper Busta Rhymes, New Orleans comes packed with a diverse slate of musical influences. There’s the reggae-infused “Hard Enough,” which explores relationship issues. “I’m looking for a love unconditional / Not one that goes wherever the wind blows,” declares Morton as the song opens.

&gt; The self-described “Dr. Love” traverses the same landscape on the mid-tempo “Work It Out.” Set off by a touch of synth and a hypnotic drumbeat, the song once again spotlights Morton’s tantalizing tenor. Also noteworthy is “Heavy,” a song revamped from Morton’s 2012 EP and featuring Adam Levine. Sporting a funk/rock track reminiscent of Sly Stone and Prince, the song’s lyrics were inspired by Morton’s frustration at one point with his indie career.

&gt; “It was at a point where I was trying to figure out what the next step was,” says Morton, who hadn’t yet connected with pop hitmakers Maroon 5. “This was me getting those feelings out. Since that frustration, I’ve had one of the biggest years in my career. It’s crazy.”

&gt; Influenced by acts ranging from the Beatles and James Taylor to Wonder and Donny Hathaway, the New Orleans native is the son of gospel singer Paul S. Morton. His formal foray into the industry was as a member of the band Freestyle Nation, which debuted in the early 2000s. But it was as a songwriter/ producer that Morton left his first indelible impression. He won a Grammy Award for his songwriting/ production of India.Arie’s “Interested” from her 2002 album Voyage to India.

&gt; That opened the door to more collaborations (Jermaine Dupri, LL Cool J, Monica, Musiq Soulchild, Trinitee 5:7) and additional accolades (Dove and Stellar Awards) for his work with gospel singer DeWayne Woods. Woods’ “Let Go, Let God” spent a record 70 weeks on the gospel chart. Along the way, Morton released several acclaimed indie solo albums. He also attracted the attention of Academy Award-winning producer AR Rahman (“Slumdog Millionaire”), who asked Morton to contribute a song (“Sajna”) to the soundtrack for the Vince Vaughn comedy “Couples Retreat.”

&gt; Morton’s next big break occurred three years ago, when he was asked to audition by friend and Maroon
5 music director Adam Blackstone for a spot in the band as its keyboardist/vocalist. Soon after, childhood friend and Young Money Entertainment president Mack Maine championed Morton’s music and vision to Cash Money co-CEO’s Roland “Slim” Williams and Bryan “Birdman” Williams. With Lil Wayne co-signing his approval as well, Morton is ready to bring his journey full circle with New Orleans.

&gt; “My indie years and working with various artists, including Maroon 5, have helped me understand who I am as both an individual and an artist,” says Morton. “It has allowed me to create a fan base that will forever be with me. Now I’m being given the opportunity to do on steroids what I’ve been doing for years.” Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; The time is now for one of the industry’s best-kept secrets: PJ Morton. The Maroon 5 keyboardist/ backing vocalist makes his major label debut on May 14 with New Orleans, his first album for Young Money Entertainment/Cash Money Records. One listen to Morton’s anticipated project quickly reveals why the multi-talent became a favorite on the indie R&amp;B circuit and an in-demand songwriter/producer and also why the limitless talent will be a game changer for the Lil Wayne-founded Young Money.

&gt; New Orleans marks the Cash Money imprint’s first step toward broadening its already wide appeal, thanks to a hit-making and award-winning roster that includes founder Lil Wayne, Drake and Nicki Minaj. And there’s no better ambassador to musically personify that message than Morton, whose self described “soulful pop” seamlessly spans multiple genres from gospel and R&amp;B/funk to pop and rock.

&gt; “I’ve always pushed boundaries,” says Morton, “but I always remain true to who I am musically. New Orleans is a natural progression of who I am. I can’t explain it except through my music. That proves it better than anything I can say.”

&gt; Building that case is “Only One” featuring Stevie Wonder. Quickly garnering strong reaction following its January premiere on Billboard.com, the song is the lead single from New Orleans. Armed with an infectious hook and a head-boppin’ groove, the up-tempo number showcases Morton’s velvety tenor, songwriting skills and musicianship, accented by Wonder’s distinctive harmonica.

&gt; “Stevie joining me on the track is the ultimate start. It’s my dream come true,” says Morton of teaming with Wonder. “I want to continue the legacy he represents: musicianship and positivity.”

&gt; New Orleans itself stems from Morton’s acclaimed 2012 EP, Following My First Mind, featuring guest cameos from Maroon 5’s Adam Levine, Lil Wayne and Jazmine Sullivan. A nod to Morton’s hometown and musical roots, the forthcoming New Orleans finds Morton at the keyboard playing with a full backing band complete with horns and strings. The result is a lush, melodic yet organic 10-track set that grabs listeners right from the opening title track.

&gt; “New Orleans is where I learned how to play music,” recalls Morton. “It’s the physical and mind space I was in when I fell in love with music. It wasn’t about marketing, radio and publicity. It was just about making music because I loved it. It made me feel good. Young Money wanted me creatively as I am. That’s why I’m excited about this next chapter.”

&gt; Also featuring rapper Busta Rhymes, New Orleans comes packed with a diverse slate of musical influences. There’s the reggae-infused “Hard Enough,” which explores relationship issues. “I’m looking for a love unconditional / Not one that goes wherever the wind blows,” declares Morton as the song opens.

&gt; The self-described “Dr. Love” traverses the same landscape on the mid-tempo “Work It Out.” Set off by a touch of synth and a hypnotic drumbeat, the song once again spotlights Morton’s tantalizing tenor. Also noteworthy is “Heavy,” a song revamped from Morton’s 2012 EP and featuring Adam Levine. Sporting a funk/rock track reminiscent of Sly Stone and Prince, the song’s lyrics were inspired by Morton’s frustration at one point with his indie career.

&gt; “It was at a point where I was trying to figure out what the next step was,” says Morton, who hadn’t yet connected with pop hitmakers Maroon 5. “This was me getting those feelings out. Since that frustration, I’ve had one of the biggest years in my career. It’s crazy.”

&gt; Influenced by acts ranging from the Beatles and James Taylor to Wonder and Donny Hathaway, the New Orleans native is the son of gospel singer Paul S. Morton. His formal foray into the industry was as a member of the band Freestyle Nation, which debuted in the early 2000s. But it was as a songwriter/ producer that Morton left his first indelible impression. He won a Grammy Award for his songwriting/ production of India.Arie’s “Interested” from her 2002 album Voyage to India.

&gt; That opened the door to more collaborations (Jermaine Dupri, LL Cool J, Monica, Musiq Soulchild, Trinitee 5:7) and additional accolades (Dove and Stellar Awards) for his work with gospel singer DeWayne Woods. Woods’ “Let Go, Let God” spent a record 70 weeks on the gospel chart. Along the way, Morton released several acclaimed indie solo albums. He also attracted the attention of Academy Award-winning producer AR Rahman (“Slumdog Millionaire”), who asked Morton to contribute a song (“Sajna”) to the soundtrack for the Vince Vaughn comedy “Couples Retreat.”

&gt; Morton’s next big break occurred three years ago, when he was asked to audition by friend and Maroon
5 music director Adam Blackstone for a spot in the band as its keyboardist/vocalist. Soon after, childhood friend and Young Money Entertainment president Mack Maine championed Morton’s music and vision to Cash Money co-CEO’s Roland “Slim” Williams and Bryan “Birdman” Williams. With Lil Wayne co-signing his approval as well, Morton is ready to bring his journey full circle with New Orleans.

&gt; “My indie years and working with various artists, including Maroon 5, have helped me understand who I am as both an individual and an artist,” says Morton. “It has allowed me to create a fan base that will forever be with me. Now I’m being given the opportunity to do on steroids what I’ve been doing for years.” Read more on Last.fm.

99% of musicians are shit and most people don't listen to them. Same can be said for people who do anything. Music is also much cheaper to make than video games. 

&gt;  The argument being made, which has economic and scientific research behind it, is that people will create video games because they want to in a society that meets their needs without them having to worry about them. 

I never said they wouldn't. I said most of them wouldn't be able to. There is a difference.

tetris is nothing like games these days, and the guy who made it wasn't some hobbyist in a garage he was a researcher at a place with millions poured into it at the soviet academy of science

&gt; Lia Ices is the stage name of Lia Kessel, a singer-songwriter from Westport, Connecticut, currently living in the Hudson Valley, New York. While she has been performing and recording for several years, Ices gained prominence when her song ""Love Is Won"", from her second studio album Grown Unknown, was played over the closing credits of the second-to-last episode of season one of HBO's Girls on June 10, 2012.

&gt; Her mother is a photographer and book binder, and Kessel says that her father has been a source of musical inspiration throughout her life, encouraging her to write her own songs from an early age. She began playing the piano at age 5, studied theatre at the preparatory high school Walnut Hill School for the Arts and went on to explore the worlds of dance and theater at the Experimental Theatre Wing of New York University's Tisch School of the Arts and by studying Shakespeare at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. Kessel's brother, Eliot, is also a musician, and a collaborator in her music.

&gt; In 2005 she began performing publicly under her birth name of Lia Kessel, performing at small venues in New York. Kessel did press an EP of songs independently, but these songs were never distributed commercially. During this time she worked with two backing bands, The Marina and Wild Cries. In late 2007 she participated in the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Baby Dee, called Safe Inside the Day, singing vocals on three tracks.

&gt; In 2008, she adopted the name Lia Ices, and her first full-length album, Necima, was released in September of that year, produced by Nicolas Vernhes at Rare Book Room Studios in Brooklyn, NY. The music webzine Pitchfork wrote of the album: ""When Ices and Vernhes find a creative symbiosis, usually on the record's shorter, pop-leaning tracks, the results are spectacular."" Critics compared her singing favorably to that of Kate Bush, and more contemporary artists like Feist and Bat For Lashes, as well as Tori Amos and Cat Power.

&gt; In early 2011, Ices released her sophomore album, Grown Unknown. Again it was mixed at the Rare Book Room Studios in Brooklyn but released through her new label, Jagjaguwar Records. She spent six months in Vermont writing most of the album, and recorded the album at the The Clubhouse in Rhinebeck, NY. The album's second track ""Daphne"" features a duet with Bon Iver frontman, Justin Vernon. Critics found her voice more relaxed than on her debut album.

&gt; On April 3, 2012, Jagjaguwar Records released a 7"" single of Ices covering Pink Floyd's ""Wish You Were Here"", taken from Mojo magazine's Pink Floyd October 2011 special edition. The B side was another cover, of Syd Barrett's ""Late Night"". Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Janelle Monáe (born Janelle Monáe Robinson on December 1, 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and performer.

&gt;  She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

His girlfriend, Laura, has just left him for the guy upstairs, and Rob is both miserable and relieved. After all, could he have spent his life with someone who has a bad record collection? Rob seeks refuge in the company of the offbeat clerks at his store, who endlessly review their top five films; top five Elvis Costello songs; top five episodes of Cheers. Rob tries dating a singer, but maybe it’s just that he’s always wanted to sleep with someone who has a record contract. Then he sees Laura again.

Addled by addiction and chronic pain, Berg meets Alejandro, a reclusive, master boatbuilder, and begins to see a path forward.

But when she starts to crush on a boy named Ryuu, who's frozen out by the Brats and despised by her new family, her already tenuous living situation just might implode.""

Then came the Schism. Now the kingdom is called Rimbaku and is a pale shadow of its former self, a land stripped of its glory and its power. The only magic left comes from aitachi, the Relicant Touch - the ability to absorb skills and memories by consuming aishone: the bones of the dead. Rimbaku's enemies are circling, testing the nation's borders. They know the empire is weak and are determined to push it over the edge and then strip its bones as it has done to its dead for so long. Meanwhile, the brothers Kagiri and Noniki set out from their small village with a handful of aishone and a great deal of hope. They soon find the world a bigger, darker place than they imagined and are forced to accept a dangerous proposal, one that will put both of them at risk for not only their lives but their very souls - and that may change the Relicant Empire forever.""

* Moving the Mountain by Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1911), read by Chloe Boyle for FrontPage -- While there are 2 other indie published narrations of this classic feminist utopian novel, if narrator samples of those didn't tempt you this one is also under $1. Unbelievable. ""Originally published serially in Perkins Gilman's periodical The Forerunner and then in book form, both in 1911. The book was one element in the major wave of utopian and dystopian literature that marked the later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The novel was also the first volume in Gilman's utopian trilogy; it was followed by the famous ""Herland"" (1915) and its sequel, ""With Her in Ourland"" (1916). John Robertson, lost in Tibet for thirty years, is finally brought back to America by his sister Nellie, only to find his society completely transformed.""

* 131 Days by Keith C. Blackmore (2013), read by John Lee for Podium -- ""Strength. Honor. Death. Once every year, in the city of Sunja, gladiators meet within the arena known as Sunja's Pit. Some men enter for the lure of fortune, some for the fame, and some simply for the fight. The games continue for days until a champion is finally crowned. Or until all involved perish. Four companions struggle to change their lives in and out of the arena as it becomes clear that to be a Free Trained pit fighter is to live with a mark on one's head. And not everyone is pleased to learn of their plans, as the four warriors soon discover that the path to establishing a formal presence in the games, after the season has started, is infinitely more difficult than expected. All the while, unseen forces watch, waiting for the best time to strike at the companions and take everything that they have. This is blood sport at its finest. At its worst. At its longest.""",,,,darkgreen,False,False,[],False,,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",,,False,,True,t3_a7a4p0,,dark,,/r/audiobooks/comments/a7a4p0/new_audiobooks_this_week_december_18_2018/ec1kyq4/,public,,,,Moderator-Blogger,,1545141272.0,r/audiobooks,0,,,,,,1138022937.0,,,1547763285.0,,,

&gt; Lia Ices is the stage name of Lia Kessel, a singer-songwriter from Westport, Connecticut, currently living in the Hudson Valley, New York. While she has been performing and recording for several years, Ices gained prominence when her song ""Love Is Won"", from her second studio album Grown Unknown, was played over the closing credits of the second-to-last episode of season one of HBO's Girls on June 10, 2012.

&gt; Her mother is a photographer and book binder, and Kessel says that her father has been a source of musical inspiration throughout her life, encouraging her to write her own songs from an early age. She began playing the piano at age 5, studied theatre at the preparatory high school Walnut Hill School for the Arts and went on to explore the worlds of dance and theater at the Experimental Theatre Wing of New York University's Tisch School of the Arts and by studying Shakespeare at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. Kessel's brother, Eliot, is also a musician, and a collaborator in her music.

&gt; In 2005 she began performing publicly under her birth name of Lia Kessel, performing at small venues in New York. Kessel did press an EP of songs independently, but these songs were never distributed commercially. During this time she worked with two backing bands, The Marina and Wild Cries. In late 2007 she participated in the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Baby Dee, called Safe Inside the Day, singing vocals on three tracks.

&gt; In 2008, she adopted the name Lia Ices, and her first full-length album, Necima, was released in September of that year, produced by Nicolas Vernhes at Rare Book Room Studios in Brooklyn, NY. The music webzine Pitchfork wrote of the album: ""When Ices and Vernhes find a creative symbiosis, usually on the record's shorter, pop-leaning tracks, the results are spectacular."" Critics compared her singing favorably to that of Kate Bush, and more contemporary artists like Feist and Bat For Lashes, as well as Tori Amos and Cat Power.

&gt; In early 2011, Ices released her sophomore album, Grown Unknown. Again it was mixed at the Rare Book Room Studios in Brooklyn but released through her new label, Jagjaguwar Records. She spent six months in Vermont writing most of the album, and recorded the album at the The Clubhouse in Rhinebeck, NY. The album's second track ""Daphne"" features a duet with Bon Iver frontman, Justin Vernon. Critics found her voice more relaxed than on her debut album.

&gt; On April 3, 2012, Jagjaguwar Records released a 7"" single of Ices covering Pink Floyd's ""Wish You Were Here"", taken from Mojo magazine's Pink Floyd October 2011 special edition. The B side was another cover, of Syd Barrett's ""Late Night"". Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Janelle Monáe (born Janelle Monáe Robinson on December 1, 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and performer.

&gt;  She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

&gt; Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band formed in Bolton, Greater Manchester, UK in 1976, led by singer-songwriter and guitarist Pete Shelley (1955 – 2018) for nearly their entire existence.

&gt; They are commonly regarded as an important influence on the Manchester music scene, the independent record label movement and the punk rock, power pop, pop punk and indie rock genres in general. They are primarily remembered for their singles, a string of would-be hits that combined a strong grasp of pop song craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy. These singles were collected on Singles Going Steady, described by critic Ned Raggett as a ""punk masterpiece"" The widely covered ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" remains one of their best-known songs.

&gt; The name ""Buzzcocks"" partially comes from the Manchester slang term cock meaning youngster, and its use in the 1970s ITV drama serial Rock Follies which included the catch phrases ""that's the buzz, cocks"" and ""give me a buzz, cock!""

&gt; Buzzcocks were one of the key first generation British punk rock bands to form in the wake of the Sex Pistols in 1976. They were founded by Mancunians Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto, however Devoto left soon after the group released their Spiral Scratch EP (on their own independent label), leaving Shelley to take over vocals. 

&gt; They are best known for their catchy, poppy punk sound, which has been widely influential, which was adopted as Peter Shelley took over on the vocals, singing about what the whole punk rock scene opted not to sing about: love. Devoto in the meanwhile formed Magazine.

&gt; They rehearsed in a friend's kitchen and played at the all-day 100 club punk ""festival"", in London. At the end of 1977 the band signed to United Artists and released ""Orgasm Addict"", with Shelley's high-pitched vocal delivery and Ramones-esque fuzz-guitar sound ensuring the controversial single would be played over again. Later came ""What Do I Get?"" which hit the UK charts and showed Shelley's brilliance in songwriting.

&gt; An LP was then released, Another Music in a Different Kitchen which came with its own carrier bag, labelled ""Product"". In 1978-79 five chart-hitting singles were released including ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" and had captured a pop-loving audience by this time. Love Bites, their second LP was released later on, which had less excitement than the last album, though it did sell well, with Steve Diggle taking over lyric-writing.

&gt; October 1979 saw A Different Kind of Tension which was panned by some critics, quite unfairly, as it contains some excellent songs, the title track being the stand-out. It perhaps suffered from being the second album to be released that year, with the record company keen to capitalise on the band's chart success at the time. 

&gt; 3 more singles followed in 1980, but the spark had clearly gone out for a while. Musical differences and the long slog behind them led to the band splitting in early 1981. Pete Shelley embarked in a solo career.. 

&gt; He released three dance/electronic influenced solo albums: Homosapien, XL1 and Heaven and The Sea - all with the same fine songwriting skills. Meanwhile, Steve Diggle formed Flag of Convenience - a power pop combo -  and toured with some success. 

&gt; A 5 album/CD set was released in 1989 called Product, which contained all the albums to date, plus the greatest hits and B sides album, Singles Going Steady, and the last non-album singles, Why She's A Girl From the Chainstore, Airwaves Dream and Running Free, plus the B sides

&gt; In 1992 the Buzzcocks reformed, without original drummer John Maher and bassist Steve Garvey, and releasd Trade Test Transmissions in 1993, quite different from their earlier material, with nods to the power pop scene popular at the time. All Set in 1996 saw a return to form with familiar riffs and pin sharp lyrics pop-punk. Next year Chronology was released, the missing album, including outtakes from the three United Artists albums.  In 1999 they released Modern, which saw Shelley in reflective mode and Steve Diggle taking over more of the vocal duties.

&gt; Then followed another brief break in 2000, with Shelley teaming up with old band-mate Howard Devoto to release a largely disappointing album, Buzzkunst. Compilations followed, including Inventory in 2003, which contained every single to date, and 30 in 2005 to celebrate 30 years performing

&gt; 2005 saw the Buzzcocks back touring and in 2007 they released the superb Flat Pack Philosophy, widely agreed to rank up with the best of Buzzcocks output

&gt; 2008/9 saw a short tour where the band played tracks from Another Music and Love Bites.

&gt; In August 2011 they headlined the first night of The Rhythm Festival in Bedfordshire.

&gt; In November 2011 it was announced they would be playing two shows in 2012 that would feature the original line-up as well as the classic line-up of the band reunited for the first time in many years; these shows took place on 25 May 2012 in Manchester at the O2 Apollo and on 26 May in Brixton at the O2 Academy. It was announced on 26 May 2012 that, for the first time, they would headline Thursday night in the Empress Ballroom at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool sharing the stage with the likes of Rancid, Public Image Limited and Social Distortion.

&gt; On 1 May 2014 Buzzcocks released the album The Way via PledgeMusic. On 13 September 2014 Buzzcocks played ""a brief but triumphant set"" at Riot Fest 2014 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. In October 2014 Buzzcocks toured the U.K. for three weeks with The Dollyrots as main support.

&gt; In 2016, the band embarked on their 40th-anniversary tour (dubbed ""Buzzcocks 40""). In 2017, ""Why Can't I Touch It"" was featured in the opening segment of the Telltale game 'Guardians of the Galaxy.

&gt; Buzzcocks continue to be a huge influence on many bands and are still enjoyed by a large, and very loyal, fanbase.

&gt; Pete Shelley died on 6 December 2018. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; They are commonly regarded as an important influence on the Manchester music scene, the independent record label movement and the punk rock, power pop, pop punk and indie rock genres in general. They are primarily remembered for their singles, a string of would-be hits that combined a strong grasp of pop song craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy. These singles were collected on Singles Going Steady, described by critic Ned Raggett as a ""punk masterpiece"" The widely covered ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" remains one of their best-known songs.

&gt; The name ""Buzzcocks"" partially comes from the Manchester slang term cock meaning youngster, and its use in the 1970s ITV drama serial Rock Follies which included the catch phrases ""that's the buzz, cocks"" and ""give me a buzz, cock!""

&gt; Buzzcocks were one of the key first generation British punk rock bands to form in the wake of the Sex Pistols in 1976. They were founded by Mancunians Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto, however Devoto left soon after the group released their Spiral Scratch EP (on their own independent label), leaving Shelley to take over vocals. 

&gt; They are best known for their catchy, poppy punk sound, which has been widely influential, which was adopted as Peter Shelley took over on the vocals, singing about what the whole punk rock scene opted not to sing about: love. Devoto in the meanwhile formed Magazine.

&gt; They rehearsed in a friend's kitchen and played at the all-day 100 club punk ""festival"", in London. At the end of 1977 the band signed to United Artists and released ""Orgasm Addict"", with Shelley's high-pitched vocal delivery and Ramones-esque fuzz-guitar sound ensuring the controversial single would be played over again. Later came ""What Do I Get?"" which hit the UK charts and showed Shelley's brilliance in songwriting.

&gt; An LP was then released, Another Music in a Different Kitchen which came with its own carrier bag, labelled ""Product"". In 1978-79 five chart-hitting singles were released including ""Ever Fallen in Love?"" and had captured a pop-loving audience by this time. Love Bites, their second LP was released later on, which had less excitement than the last album, though it did sell well, with Steve Diggle taking over lyric-writing.

&gt; October 1979 saw A Different Kind of Tension which was panned by some critics, quite unfairly, as it contains some excellent songs, the title track being the stand-out. It perhaps suffered from being the second album to be released that year, with the record company keen to capitalise on the band's chart success at the time. 

&gt; 3 more singles followed in 1980, but the spark had clearly gone out for a while. Musical differences and the long slog behind them led to the band splitting in early 1981. Pete Shelley embarked in a solo career.. 

&gt; He released three dance/electronic influenced solo albums: Homosapien, XL1 and Heaven and The Sea - all with the same fine songwriting skills. Meanwhile, Steve Diggle formed Flag of Convenience - a power pop combo -  and toured with some success. 

&gt; A 5 album/CD set was released in 1989 called Product, which contained all the albums to date, plus the greatest hits and B sides album, Singles Going Steady, and the last non-album singles, Why She's A Girl From the Chainstore, Airwaves Dream and Running Free, plus the B sides

&gt; In 1992 the Buzzcocks reformed, without original drummer John Maher and bassist Steve Garvey, and releasd Trade Test Transmissions in 1993, quite different from their earlier material, with nods to the power pop scene popular at the time. All Set in 1996 saw a return to form with familiar riffs and pin sharp lyrics pop-punk. Next year Chronology was released, the missing album, including outtakes from the three United Artists albums.  In 1999 they released Modern, which saw Shelley in reflective mode and Steve Diggle taking over more of the vocal duties.

&gt; Then followed another brief break in 2000, with Shelley teaming up with old band-mate Howard Devoto to release a largely disappointing album, Buzzkunst. Compilations followed, including Inventory in 2003, which contained every single to date, and 30 in 2005 to celebrate 30 years performing

&gt; 2005 saw the Buzzcocks back touring and in 2007 they released the superb Flat Pack Philosophy, widely agreed to rank up with the best of Buzzcocks output

&gt; 2008/9 saw a short tour where the band played tracks from Another Music and Love Bites.

&gt; In August 2011 they headlined the first night of The Rhythm Festival in Bedfordshire.

&gt; In November 2011 it was announced they would be playing two shows in 2012 that would feature the original line-up as well as the classic line-up of the band reunited for the first time in many years; these shows took place on 25 May 2012 in Manchester at the O2 Apollo and on 26 May in Brixton at the O2 Academy. It was announced on 26 May 2012 that, for the first time, they would headline Thursday night in the Empress Ballroom at the Rebellion Festival in Blackpool sharing the stage with the likes of Rancid, Public Image Limited and Social Distortion.

&gt; On 1 May 2014 Buzzcocks released the album The Way via PledgeMusic. On 13 September 2014 Buzzcocks played ""a brief but triumphant set"" at Riot Fest 2014 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. In October 2014 Buzzcocks toured the U.K. for three weeks with The Dollyrots as main support.

&gt; In 2016, the band embarked on their 40th-anniversary tour (dubbed ""Buzzcocks 40""). In 2017, ""Why Can't I Touch It"" was featured in the opening segment of the Telltale game 'Guardians of the Galaxy.

&gt; Buzzcocks continue to be a huge influence on many bands and are still enjoyed by a large, and very loyal, fanbase.

&gt; Fossil Collective is British folk duo David Fendick and Johnny Hooker.

&gt; This is a band that do things differently. Beautiful melodic music, with rich glorious harmonies and meticulous attention to detail, it is as much an aural statement as it is a pleasure to listen to. Layer upon layer of harmony mixed with delicate uplifting sounds may well remind you of other artists, be it Neil Young, Simon &amp; Garfunkel or Midlake but this music is no mere imitation. Whilst Fossil Collective's songs tip their cap to these classic musicians, scratch the surface and you discover something more contemporary, yet equally as rewarding.

&gt; It seems impossible that something so sonically complete could appear as if from nowhere, but Fossil Collective, the Yorkshire two-piece have been perfecting their craft and working towards this moment for years. Consisting of multi-instrumentalists David Fendick and Jonny Hooker, both were local musicians from the Leeds music scene, whose paths had crossed at various points in different bands. 'What separated Jonny from the other people I'd met was his total commitment to music' begins Dave. 'Whereas other people we were around were in bands for somewhat clichéd reasons, our focus was the music and the songs and for that reason we gravitated towards each other'. After a successful album with Leeds band Vib Gyor, the duo decided to strip everything back and start again.

&gt; Hooker reminisces, ""we felt we had to fold our cards and be honest to ourselves. We were listening to the kind of music we grew up with. (Neil Young, Fleetwood Mac, The Beach Boys, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, James Taylor) We decided there and then to try and capture the essence of that traditional songcraft, to strip everything back to the song, lyrics and melody'' Fendick steps in ""It was actually very liberating to be able to do that"".

&gt; Armed with three roughly prepared demos, the duo found themselves looking for a recording studio. 'We had no money at all, but our friends had a modest little studio in a crypt just outside of the city' says Dave. 'It was a totally surreal place to go to as it was in the middle of nowhere. We had to stop recording at various points during the day as the main church was directly above the crypt. Whenever there was a mass or a wedding for example we had to be quiet - like little church mice scurrying about downstairs.’ However, a week of intense recording paid off, and they re-surfaced with 3 songs that would become their self released 'Honey Slides' EP. 

&gt; Jonny explains. 'Before we had even decided on the name Fossil Collective we realised that we wanted this project to be a continual running order of like-minded local artists. We worked on the principle that if we surrounded ourselves with an evolving stream of people we admired then our music would never become stale. Keeping away from the constraints of a 'typical' band dynamic would keep it open and interesting for us. If we wanted a harpist we'd go and find one, If we wanted a cellist we'd go and find one and so on.'

&gt; Knowing they were on to something special they wanted something visual to reflect this. Enlisting the help of Leeds animator Ashley Dean (Broken Pixel) was the next logical step. ‘Ash is a good friend and a like-minded independent local artist. We played him On &amp; On and asked him to interpret the song.’ The result was the stop/start animated video of a courtship between a wolf and a stag that went viral on youtube, getting over 250,000 hits in 2 weeks. 

&gt; Once they put their heads above water, things started happening very quickly. Their 3rd gig was at Shepherds Bush Empire, supporting Benjamin Francis Leftwich. ""It was great because other artists were contacting us, saying how much they liked our music and inviting us to tour"" remembers Jonny. ""It was sudden, but we were lucky to have great network of friends to come play with us and help interpret the songs live … after all, who is going to turn down the chance to play Shepherds bush Empire!"" The band did a full tour with Ben and then another UK support with soul singer Ren Harvieu.

&gt; On 11th June 2012 Fossil Collectives Debut EP 'Let It Go' was released. Lead track was 'Single of the Week' on iTunes USA, opening the doors to a lot of new fans. It received plays and support from Mark Riley, Radcliffe and Maconie, Chris Hawkins and Steve Lamacq at 6 Music. It also won the 6 music rebel playlist. Radio 2 support came from Bob Harris, Mark Radcliffe and an extremely supportive Dermot O'Leary who invited them in for a chat and to perform on his Saturday Radio2 show.  'Let it Go' also made the XFM playlist, the Q playlist &amp; the NME 'A' list. A 10 date headline tour coincided with this, selling out in Manchester &amp; London in a matter of days.

&gt; The band built on this success by releasing the 'On &amp; On' EP on 22nd October. Receiving the same support from radio, they were also invited in to record an infamous Daytrotter Session. Press support came from Sunday Times, Time Out, The Fly, The Independent &amp; NME. It was at this point that The Civil Wars starting tweeting about how much they were enjoying the music. A few friendly emails later and Fossil Collective were supporting them at the key gigs of their UK tour. (Camden Roundhouse, Manchester Apollo, Glasgow 02 Academy) 'We feel privileged to play anywhere though' says Dave - be it our last sell out London show to a couple of hundred people, or a few thousand people at Camden Roundhouse. What is important is that we always stay true to ourselves and the music.'

&gt; After a winter spent locked away in the studio, Fossil Collective came out of hibernation with “Tell Where I Lie” in hand – their beautifully crafted, ten track, debut album. The album hit record stores on April 8th 2013, the same day the band were invited into Bob Harris’ Radio 2 studio to record a two track session. Released to rapturous acclaim from both fans and critics alike; “Tell Where I Lie” was named iTunes’ ‘editors choice’, quickly climbed to number 1 in the US ‘New Artist Billboard Chart and graced the pages of Clash, Q Magazine, NME, Drowned In Sound and Hunger.

&gt; I Set The Sea On Fire is a British alternative rock band from Sheffield, UK. The band are well-known for their single ""Tastes Like Funk"", which got airplay on BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 2. Combining traditional indie with elements of funk, grunge and hip Hop, I Set The Sea On Fire are making a name for themselves as the next massive sound out of Sheffield. With four-part harmonies, a trumpet, trombone and flute alongside the traditional indie band, the sound is hard to describe, but they've settled with comparing it to an off shore oil rig explosion, but with less screams and a lot more trumpet. 

&gt; Members include Peter Jenkins (Bass / Vocals / DJ) and Billy Washington (Guitar / Vocals).

&gt; Originally a duo formed in 2007, the outfit is well-known for their dramatic and energetic live performances at prestigious venues all around the UK including headlining festivals, academy’s and private events alike. A synthesis of electronic and organic instrumentation allows their audience to soar to ecstatic heights through heart pumping anthems as well as explore the pits of despair in bittersweet haunting melodies. Ultimately, it’s I Set The Sea On Fire’s live shows that generates the most enthusiastic reviews; “The new band of the 21st century, bringing in the new era of rock/alternative while creating their own sound and bringing in a big following” — Uncut Project.

&gt; “Exceptional for such a young and new act, The new sound of the youth”
- Uncut Project 2011

&gt; “Could you ask for more? Amazing atmosphere on stage, the best music we’ve heard from a teenage band in a long time, aswell as a complete inability to stop f**king dancing to I Set The Sea On Fire”
- The Boardwalk 2009 Read more on Last.fm.

Upside down land has been jacking off for at least 6 hours now, I think

Edit: what the fuck? Gold? Time for an obligatory thanking of a kind stranger

Thank you kind stranger! I always knew this day would come, but I never knew when. After every post, every comment, I ask myself ""is this the one? Will this be the piece of content to finally move someone to spend five bucks to make my experience on this app slightly better?"" That usually gets me thinking about the unique social dynamic Reddit's premium system fosters. Although most of their profits come from advertisers and their main product is us - the audience- it is interesting that the only product they provide for us to purchase is charity. It makes sense from a business perspective, as any free platform makes most of their money from a select group of high-spending users, their ""Whales"". However, standard premium memberships limit the spending capacity of each whale, since they can't buy themselves two premium memberships on the same account. However, by allowing them to provide that membership and recognition of quality to whatever other user they deem fit, Reddit allows the whales to spend as much as they want and keep the money flowing. This dependency on the altruism of Whales naturally draws some parallels to nature (pun intended). Nature's whales provide food, aid, and transport to all kinds of organisms, from the barnacle to the remora? But they are not essential to their survival. So too do the whales of Reddit help those who don't really need it but sure do appreciate it. Which brings me to my next point: the perceived value of gold and currency's worth in modern society. People often argue that money as a concept is manipulative because of its lack of inherent value, and that we should bring back some form of gold or silver standard. But that also presents a bit of a problem, because gold has no reason to be considered to be considered any more valuable than any other metal. Sure it looks nice, but what else has it got going for it? It's conductive, but I really doubt the gold sitting in Fort Knox is being used for circuitboards. It's not. It's only there to serve itself and sit around being valuable. And yet our entire world economy, and every system that depends on money, rely entirely on our perception that gold and currency hold value. What would happen if everyone decided to move on from gold? How would society collapse? What would end us first? Would we fight until there were none of us left? Would the collapse of every government bring about famine and disease, which would spread unchecked with no health organizations to stop it? Or would we mostly be fine, since most people are decent at heart? These apocalyptic hypotheticals entertain me, which is probably why I'm so drawn to high-brow intellectual entertainment on the nature of man, like Undertale or Rick and Morty. Stories like those just shake me to my core, with their potent character moments and plot twists, and I really can't understand how people can criticize them. If you can't appreciate the quality storytelling, acting, music, and tone that these tales convey, I'm sorry, but I will not weep for you. At that point, it's a choice you've made to ignore high-class intellectual entertainment. On a lighter note, I do appreciate the resurgence in popularity of Undertale, Megolovania in particular. This is naturally due to the post-launch support the game is receiving, which is unprecedented in scale, quality, and haste among indie games, and games in general. Never, in the history of entertainment, ever, has a piece of media received a second part of the scale or quality Undertale has this quickly, and I don't expect it ever to be topped. The only piece of entertainment media I could see getting the treatment Undertale has is Rick and Morty, because of the intense care and effort put in by the entire creative team, day and night, nonstop, for intellectuals like me. With that said, I really think we should discuss the creative bankruptcy of the television and film industries, since Rick's quest for galactic redemption seems to be at odds with the whims of studio executives. Funding seems to be driving everything dangerously towards what will make a profit rather than what is artistically valuable. Take Illumination studios. They take classic tales like The Grinch and Sing and push out the most unremarkable product they can on the lowest budget reasonable, and then market like they're on borrowed time. You cannot escape the Illumination marketing team. They're everywhere. Your TV, your memes, your aunts, etc. I liked Despicable Me, I thought it was a fine film, Steve Carrell was great, but the marketing for the spinoff made me retroactively hate a movie that used to be a favorite of mine. Hopefully their studio burns down before they finish work on that Shrek reboot, because I cannot stand to see that (Academy Award Winning) series tarnished by such a morally corrupt corporation.",,,,,False,False,[],False,,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 1, 'gid_3': 0}",,,False,,True,t3_a1xz7s,,,,/r/funny/comments/a1xz7s/its_over_bois_the_war_is_over/eatoe3i/,public,,,,,,1543624571.0,r/funny,0,,,,,,1529857348.0,,,1546259326.0,,,

I think the whole idea would be to reveal what kind of a person there was behind all these characters, someone to whom all of these ch-ch-ch-changes came naturally, and we would be surprised to see that nope, he didn't wake up a different guy every morning, but was indeed one very clear-minded (sometimes less clear, though)  guy with a great set of ideas on how to turn his music alive on stage.

Obviously, for an actor to go for Bowie, it would need to be somebody very versatile in character acting, definitely British and a sparkling personality. I'd be surprised if Benedict Cumberbatch wouldn't be approached by the casting team.. But one should never expect the obvious with these, the casting agents can be genial in their work, and we can be really surprised on who they pick for Bowie. I mean, when I first heard Rami Malek is doing Freddie, instead of apparently-perfect Sascha Baron Cohen, I was really let down, but it turned out he was great. That's what a great actor can do, transform into whatever and we buy it.

Depending on the script, we can go either really weird and small indie, like ""I'm Not There"", but that would most likely be swept straight to Netflix or circulated with a very small theatrical presence, and I think it wouldn't be right for Bowie. The other way H'wood does this is picking a specific moment in time, like, say, ""Berlin Era"" and does a film about that. That could be a great Oscar-bait, very focused would allow the actor to focus on one era and one stage of Bowie's life, and being a period piece, it would be production design -wise really interesting challenge, with still a decent budget. 

The problem with repeating Bohemian's recipe is that Freddie died young, he died out of a grueling and controversially viewed illness and quite suddenly - but most importantly, still in height of his career. With Bowie, the tragedy is slightly more muted - he died, but not a young man, and he died out of cancer, which is far more common cause, and while he was artistically about to enter a new, exciting phase of his career, he was viewed by the masses as someone of the oldies-goldies -era when he died. Blackstar and the whole 00's discography is mostly for enthusiasts, but didn't receive tremendous amount of radio play, not close to what Greatest Hits II of Queen did back in the time. Suddenly, the whole world was listening to Queen again, and the next day the guy was dead. Bowie's death was surprise, too, but maybe slightly more of a sad passing than a national shock to the bigger audience.

But if they want to go repeating Bohemian's recipe, they will find a great big story to be somehow twisted and tucked into 2 hour format. Not impossible, that's what the screenwriters have been doing all these years, but without a doubt, a lot of important eras and parts of his life would be totally swept under the carpet, and we would probably see a story of a great artist who wanders around London streets, is blasted off to fame by Space Odyssey, then gets hooked on drugs in the US and scrambles through his creative but consumptive career, a big segment in 70's Berlin, funny stuff coming to 80's yuppie era, all the ups and downs financially, falling in love with Iman and eventually the last segment would be about the struggles to release Blackstar and his eventual death. It would work, but would need a great writer to really squeeze the essential into it.

Director would of course be essential. Depending what kind of a story they would follow, Jim Jarmusch could well pull off a great 70's Berlin-era Bowie - ""Heroes"" the movie (he could pull in great guest actors, too, and Iggy would definitely show up) but for the more accessible, Bohemian-style, they'd have to go with someone Academy-worthy, you know, someone not too crazy, a sure bet who can also be controlled and told in detail on how to make the thing happen.

The biggest problem, of course, is the fact that Bowie has been, and probably his will is, too, very selective on what kind of projects his music can be used on, and as long as his heirs control any part of his music release, I wouldn't be surprised that there reads something about in what kind of a project he only allows his music to be used, and biopic, knowing his personality and resentment for books written about his life, is probably not very high up on the list. 

So, I guess the only person who could get good access to his music and pull off a film like this would be Duncan, his son, a prolific director himself. He's a good director, but unfortunately his latest film didn't fare that well; but having said that, after Warcraft and Moon, he will get another chance, and if that goes well, he could be easily helming a story about his dad, and that would bring a lot of people to the theatres, because there isn't a lot of instances in film history where son-directed dad-biopics have existed. The question is, would that be something he would like to do? I'm sure he has been approached about this, but for sure right now it's still too early.

And hell, Bowie's legacy is only going to get stronger. It took 28 years for them to make Bohemian, so there's still plenty of time for Bowie's legacy to brew and boil before turning it into a movie.",,,,,False,False,[],False,,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",,,False,,True,t3_a1c3eu,,,,/r/DavidBowie/comments/a1c3eu/after_seeing_bohemian_rhapsody_i_really_want_to/eap91v4/,public,,,,,,1543474722.0,r/DavidBowie,0,,,,,,1524600712.0,,,1546184875.0,,,

&gt; One eskimO was ‘born’ in 2004 and is the brain child of Kristian Leontiou.  At the time Kristian was at the end of promoting his debut album: Some Day Soon (Polydor) which sold over 200,000 copies. His debut single (Story Of My Life) also went Top 10 in the UK singles chart.  Kris (as he is known to his friends) grew up in the north-west suburbs of London, his first experiences of music coming from his older sisters, who would regularly shake the Leontiou household whilst practicing with their respective punk bands, in their bedrooms! At only 10 years old Kris was mesmerized when sisters Anna and Alex would sneak him in to watch them perform at venues like The Mean Fiddler.  When most kids were getting used to weekend lay-ins, at 14 Kristian had already developed a self survival ‘street’ mentality and had already undertaken work in an array of ‘grown up’ situations that not many so young are exposed to. The resulting attribute is someone very much of his own mind, a humble belief in his own visions creatively. Often he was a child in an adult’s world. It’s no surprise then at only 15, Kristian was introduced to recording studios, adding guest vocals on friend’s garage &amp; dance demos, and using any down time to begin his first explorations musically. His early and lasting influences on these initial compositions were acts like Arrested Development, The Fugees, REM, Groove Armada and Finlay Quay.   Working in various and unsatisfying dead-end jobs after leaving school, Kris went to the studio whenever he had any spare time, hoping it would one day pay off…and eventually it did.  In his late teens Kristian met by chance Mike Sault of Warner Chappell (Dido/Craig David/Groove Armada) who promptly offered a publishing deal. Kris went traveling around the country working with various producers searching for ‘his sound’ Sault eventually paired Kristian with Producer/Song writer Pete Wilkinson (credits include Paolo Nutini &amp; Amy Macdonald) of Melodramatic Records. Together, and with Pete’s wife Sarah, they wrote and produced the Some Day Soon album in Wilkinson’s ‘spare bedroom’ studio’  The initial bedroom demos got a great and instant response from many labels and in late 2002 Kris signed to Polydor (home of Ian Brown and Snow Patrol) within a matter of weeks; Polydor had the album mixed/mastered and promptly started promoting his first single which entered the charts at no. 9. Growing up as a studio based singer, Kristian suddenly found himself on stage for the first time in his life (Islington Academy – 1000+ capacity) performing to what felt like a million people including the press, the music industry, friends, and family. In his own words ""it was the worst performance of my life, I was way too under prepared’ these days it’s a very different story ‘I feel free on stage today’ says Kristian in 2007 ‘I feel I’m meant to be up there, like I belong, back then I felt very nervous and extremely vulnerable’  During a long promotional tour for the Album throughout the UK and Europe Kris was finding it increasingly difficult emotionally ‘I began to feel like I was promoting an album that didn't really represent or ‘belong’ to me. It didn’t say anything about my personality, and musically I longed to sound more like me, whatever that was’  Kristian has always been a free spirit but at that time felt like his life was being micro managed with advice on what he said, wore, did and sang. He craved creative expression but was on a ‘good looking young man’ pop-music treadmill, one that many before him had found a false and a crushing experience.   On a flight back from L.A. in late 2004 Kristian had the flash of light that was the concept and creative birth of One eskimO ‘With absolutely no compromise’ he said ‘I wanted to create a sound of my own, magical, ambient, filmic, acoustic, beautiful and meaningful. I wanted to write about how I felt, life, love, losses &amp; failures, highs and lows, even heartbreaks. But also about how amazing human life is and how mind blowing our very existence is’.  ‘I also had my own visual interpretation of the music, for an animated visual to run alongside the music, telling magical stories with a childlike innocence whilst creating a sonic ‘journey’ for everyone. ‘Even if just for a moment, I want people to hear this and feel like it did before anything mattered in life, when they were truly free, when they were children’  The One eskimO sound was developed in a Battersea studio along side good friend - Craigie Dodds (credits include Sugababes) they took their time working with sounds and beats and soon came up with the song ‘Chocolate’.  ""This song just sums up that period in my life; this was the first proper song and just the right sound for One eskimO!"".  At the same time Kristian teamed up with Adam Falkner – experienced session musician/drummer and unbeknown to him soon to become a giraffe! They started rehearsing a live set, every detail was considered, including what everything would look and sound like for the audiences. With Kristian’s right hand man now on guitar - Martin Waugh (soon to be the penguin in the growing animal line-up) they were also lucky enough to now know Jamie Sefton who was a wizard on bass &amp; horns, he also joined and rather inevitably, become the monkey. The band was formed.   Meanwhile a mutual friend had introduced Kristian to Rollo Armstrong (faithless/dido and many more) Kristian asked Rollo directly and politely to get involved in the album, and a very reluctant Rollo agreed to take a listen to One eskimO demos. Upon hearing the song ‘Astronauts’ he immediately opted in and ended up co-producing the album with Kristian. The team was starting to mirror the vision.   At this time, it became clear that Kristian’s idea of an eskimO world and animated videos didn't really fit with the Polydor vision of a radio friendly ‘Kristian Leontiou’ so they respectfully and amicably parted company.   With the One eskimO demos completed, the band wanted to record the album how any self respecting musicians would, together and completely live. They recorded alongside ‘ark’ (Rollo/Marky Bates/ Grippa) with Phil Brown (credits include Bob Marley) engineering and all had a great time doing it. After a month of recording the band, Kristian went to Rollo’s personal ‘ark’ studios where together they spent a further year experimenting with sounds, textures, and adding lots of magic eskimO dust! 
In 2007 Martin was ‘lost in a snowstorm’ which in reality translates to Mika (who he also played guitar for) shooting to fame. He was promptly replaced by the exceptionally gifted guitarist Pete Rinaldi and what felt like a loss became a huge win ‘Pete makes us complete’ says Kris. Through a series of 'happy accidents"" Kristian met Nathan Erasmus who had just formed Gravy Media, quite literally an ‘independent company’ operating from people’s bedrooms and lounges. Gravy Media was formed with Erasmus’s childhood friend Phil Menni, together and from an early age they both shared an obsessive love for illustration and animation.  It was Nathan’s shared love of the eskimO sound that inspired the intricate visual voyages of family, innocence and magic that became the first One eskimO video. It sits alongside the stunning single ‘Hometime’   

&gt; You now know the eskimO…hello.

i also saw avenged sevenfold a bunch, and maybe i was asking for it by being there but the crowd was full of DICKS. When I was 13 a guy said some sexual shit to me and when I rejected him he poured his beer all over me 🙄

ALSO I went to Shadow of the City in 2016 and all the people there to see the 1975 paid Carly Rae DUST!!!!! speaking of dust i went to the witness tour for her and they literally kept the house lights on and she was so quiet. i was in like 400s (basically on the ceiling) and i left halfway through katy perry............. not for me. AND then i saw carly rae at a college show and the people in the crowd were basically making fun of her. Her headlining show was so much fun though !!

best: one of my fave indie bands, mae, had a concert in the middle of the woods in nashville where we all hiked up a hill together and they played during the solar eclipse last year!!

bleachers shows are amazing and their tour where muna opened and jack brought his childhood bedroom around in a trailer was pivotal.

christine and the queens felt like watching a show on Broadway. her opener Dounia was pretty awful though and the crowd was practically talking over her.

i saw mitski in 2016 and the vibe was so intense she took her shirt off (to just be in her bra) and no one made a sound. So amazing to see that (for a female artist no less)

i'm a sucker for anniversary shows, espcially all the now-broke emo artists from my youth doing them (mayday parade, the academy is...). nothing like seeing a record you've loved forever in its entirety, especially because I was too young to see them tour those albums the first time around. my first show was mcr tho which i will always cherish

After every post, every comment, I ask myself ""is this the one? Will this be the piece of content to finally move someone to spend five bucks to make my experience on this app slightly better?"" That usually gets me thinking about the unique social dynamic Reddit's premium system fosters. Although most of their profits come from advertisers and their main product is us - the audience- it is interesting that the only product they provide for us to purchase is charity. It makes sense from a business perspective, as any free platform makes most of their money from a select group of high-spending users, their ""Whales"". However, standard premium memberships limit the spending capacity of each whale, since they can't buy themselves two premium memberships on the same account. However, by allowing them to provide that membership and recognition of quality to whatever other user they deem fit, Reddit allows the whales to spend as much as they want and keep the money flowing. This dependency on the altruism of Whales naturally draws some parallels to nature (pun intended). Nature's whales provide food, aid, and transport to all kinds of organisms, from the barnacle to the remora? But they are not essential to their survival. So too do the whales of Reddit help those who don't really need it but sure do appreciate it. Which brings me to my next point: the perceived value of gold and currency's worth in modern society. People often argue that money as a concept is manipulative because of its lack of inherent value, and that we should bring back some form of gold or silver standard. But that also presents a bit of a problem, because gold has no reason to be considered to be considered any more valuable than any other metal. Sure it looks nice, but what else has it got going for it? It's conductive, but I really doubt the gold sitting in Fort Knox is being used for circuitboards. It's not. It's only there to serve itself and sit around being valuable. And yet our entire world economy, and every system that depends on money, rely entirely on our perception that gold and currency hold value. What would happen if everyone decided to move on from gold? How would society collapse? What would end us first? Would we fight until there were none of us left? Would the collapse of every government bring about famine and disease, which would spread unchecked with no health organizations to stop it? Or would we mostly be fine, since most people are decent at heart? These apocalyptic hypotheticals entertain me, which is probably why I'm so drawn to high-brow intellectual entertainment on the nature of man, like *Undertale* or *Rick and Morty*. Stories like those just shake me to my core, with their potent character moments and plot twists, and I really can't understand how people can criticize them. If you can't appreciate the __quality__ storytelling, acting, music, and tone that these tales convey, I'm sorry, but I will not weep for you. At that point, it's a choice you've made to ignore high-class intellectual entertainment. On a lighter note, I do appreciate the resurgence in popularity of *Undertale*, Megolovania in particular. This is naturally due to the post-launch support the game is receiving, which is __unprecedented__ in scale, quality, and haste among indie games, and games in general. Never, in the history of entertainment, ever, has a piece of media received a second part of the scale or quality *Undertale* has this quickly, and I don't expect it ever to be topped. The only piece of entertainment media I could see getting the treatment *Undertale* has is *Rick and Morty*, because of the intense care and effort put in by the entire creative team, day and night, nonstop, for intellectuals like me. With that said, I really think we should discuss the creative bankruptcy of the television and film industries, since Rick's quest for galactic redemption seems to be at odds with the whims of studio executives. Funding seems to be driving everything dangerously towards what will make a profit rather than what is artistically valuable. Take Illumination studios. They take classic tales like *The Grinch* and *Sing* and push out the most unremarkable product they can on the lowest budget reasonable, and then market like they're on borrowed time. You cannot escape the Illumination marketing team. They're everywhere. Your TV, your memes, your aunts, etc. I liked *Despicable Me*, I thought it was a fine film, Steve Carrell was great, but the marketing for the spinoff made me retroactively hate a movie that used to be a favorite of mine. Hopefully their studio burns down before they finish work on that *Shrek* reboot, because I cannot stand to see that (Academy Award Winning) series tarnished by such a morally corrupt corporation.

&amp;#x200B;

Manchester has 2 main train stations, Piccadilly and Victoria. Piccadilly will be your main station for train travel, you can go pretty much anywhere. It's worth mentioning here that it's just over a 2 hour train from London Euston on a Virgin train which can be as low as 15pounds if you book online and don't go during peak, usually between 10am and 2pm they're this low on a weekday so if you're only visiting for a game, this could be an option and just stay in Manchester for a night. You definitely don't need a car to get around the city, there are plenty of buses and the metro trams go pretty much everywhere now.

AirBNB is a good option if you book in advance but hotels can be quite cheap too. I was back there in June and our AirBNB was terrible, could have had a nice hotel room for the same price so up to you. I'd recommend staying in the Northern Quarter to be close to everything, but anywhere around Deansgate or Oxford Road will be fine. Manchester is a student city with 3 universities, basically student capital of Europe so anywhere around student accommodation tends to be relatively safe. Might be cheaper to stay in Fallowfield where all the student housing is, then catch a bus in to the city, takes 10-15mins.

Touristy stuff, there isn't much tbh. Castlefield is the old Roman stuff but other places in the UK are far better for this. The Imperial War Museum is pretty great though. I'd definitely recommend catching the tram to the newish Media City, best part of Manchester right now imo, lots to do and looks a bit futuristic.

Like I said, students will be everywhere, even on weeknights. Monday night was the new Saturday night while I was a student there 6 years ago. Any bar along Oxford Road is great (avoid Salisbury pub though next to the Oxford road train station, basically a biker pub). Any other bar should be full of students, easy to meet people. There's too many bars to mention so just Google or Yelp it and look at reviews.

Depending how old you are clubs can be a decent option but go late (10/11pm onwards). 5th Ave is a younger student club, think 18-20 year olds trying to get laid, plays pop and indie music. 42s is a better version of 5th Ave, plays better music and the crowd is a bit better. If you're in to rock music, definitely give Satan's Hollow a chance.

Also never discount Canal Street (runs along the canal, duh) which is essentially the Gay Village. Lots of bars and clubs with a great vibe and no idiots. Genuinely had some of the best nights out of my life there, and no you don't have to be gay to go there, everyone is welcome.

Hope you have a great time whatever you do. Manchester also has a huge music scene, if you're in to that make sure you check out what's on at the arena or the academies.

&gt; The Murmurs were an American alternative pop music duo composed of singers/songwriters Leisha Hailey and Heather Grody. They began performing in 1991 while the duo were both students of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. With their self-released, debut album, Who We Are, the duo quickly attracted a cult following on the East Village club circuit. In 1994, The Murmurs signed with MCA Records. They released their self-titled LP the same year. The duo expanded into a four-woman group in 1997 with the addition of bassist Sheri Ozeki and drummer Sherri Solinger. They released Pristine Smut in 1997 and, a year later, Blender.

&gt; Hailey and Grody rejoined in 2001 as a new band entitled Gush. But the band Gush later split up due to Hailey's busy acting schedule.

&gt; In 2007 Leisha Hailey started another band called Uh Huh Her with Camila Grey and Alicia Warrington.

&gt; As of now Uh Huh Her consists of Leisha Hailey and Camila Grey. Read more on Last.fm.

But here's my best attempt at advice: **Don't wait, just do it.** 

- Don't wait for your very best friends and family who you grew up with thinking you all gonna do it together, because they won't ever be as committed and willing to sacrifice as much as you are and they may just slow you down.

- Don't wait for the moment when you finally have the right equipment and maybe don't spend any money at first. Ask randos in the internet for a camera to borrow, or just find a camera and shoot. Films shot on iPhones have won Academy Awards. In 2013 no less. So don't worry about your picture quality and not having lights or anything just yet. Filmmaking is problem-solving. You mentioned the Revenant, you know why that was mostly shot with natural light? Because dragging gennies, lights, grip trucks, etc in the middle of the frozen wilderness is kind of a pain in the ass and expensive. So immersive storytelling choices aside, I guarantee the cost/time/human resources played into that decision. 

- Don't wait for the moment when you 'feel' like a real filmmaker. Don't wait for a degree, or screenwriting contest wins, or some 'professional', guru, teacher, or hero to tell ya- 'Hey, you got this!' You don't need permission.

- Don't wait to be good. Your first script is gonna suck. Your first film is gonna suck. Just make them. And then make some more. You have to suck before you're good. Say you wanted to play in the NBA, you'd probably expect to be spending a lot of time in basketball practice right? Do whatever it takes to be the best high school baller, and then college and so on? Nothing is instantaneous. To learn any skill, you must practice.  You **have** to practice filmmaking to get good at it. And to practice, you have to make films. 

- Whatever your idea for a film is, please just tell me a story about characters that I care about. And by 'care' I don't mean 'like'. If your story is about the most despicable bastard out there, that's fine, I'm gonna be really invested in watching them getting beaten and humiliated. Emotion is the currency of film- and characters are a tool to inject empathy into the audience's brains and elicit reactions. Just like sound, music, editing, cinematography, production design, wardrobe, visual fx, and everything else that makes up a film. Everything should be a deliberate choice to evoke emotion. But having likable characters is like the bare minimum way to get an audience to care about a story and it's the EASIEST thing for you to control starting out when you have no budget and no resources because every story NEEDS characters. So make me care about your characters, please, I beg you. 

So, come up with the best story you can tell with the resources that you have and make that. And when you then run into what seems like an insurmountable problem, hey guess what NOW YOU SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. No sound? Tell a story through silent film, or music video, or a deaf character in a terrifying scenerio. Can't get permission for that perfect location? Use whatever location you can. Have an actor who can't act? Well maybe that character had a traumatic brain injury. It's your story, but filmmaking is problem-solving and you have to be creative, you have to compromise or nothing would ever get made. Can't find a solution? Well then, you're doomed.

I went to one of the seven maritime academies in the United States, graduated with my 3rd Mate Unlimited Tonnage License (ability to navigate any size ship in the world) and bachelors of science degree in Maritime Transportation. 

I did not grow up in this industry like so many of my class mates. I was in high school dating a drummer and all my friends were getting heavy into drugs and alcohol, I saw the maritime industry as my way out, to travel the world and be as far away as possible. I am extremely thankful because I had many friends commit suicide or die from heroin overdoses. 

However, I did not want to go to my maritime school. It was military esq and I grew up in a giant hippy family where my cousins were ether professional artists or skateboarders. I had never been yelled at before in my life, I love fashion and indie music and the transition at my school was very tough at first but I wouldn’t change a thing. I really feel so thankful every single day that I am able to do what I do. I truly feel that I have the BEST job in the entire world. 

I wake up, my commute is literally 15 seconds from my stateroom to the bridge (where we navigate from), I make coffee, I take over the “watch” from the Mate who is navigating and we switch out, I am up there with my two lookouts who I am in charge of (usually men and usually at least 20 years older), we listen to music/podcasts and just go about the set track line approved by the captain. I will radio other vessels if we have to make passing arrangements and just maintain the vessel’s safety at all times by keeping a sharp lookout. We watch the sunrise together the captain will come up and we will all bullshit before breakfast.  I’ll work overtime for four hours and in total I work 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. We do not have days off while onboard.

&gt; The Murmurs were an American alternative pop music duo composed of singers/songwriters Leisha Hailey and Heather Grody. They began performing in 1991 while the duo were both students of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. With their self-released, debut album, Who We Are, the duo quickly attracted a cult following on the East Village club circuit. In 1994, The Murmurs signed with MCA Records. They released their self-titled LP the same year. The duo expanded into a four-woman group in 1997 with the addition of bassist Sheri Ozeki and drummer Sherri Solinger. They released Pristine Smut in 1997 and, a year later, Blender.

&gt; Hailey and Grody rejoined in 2001 as a new band entitled Gush. But the band Gush later split up due to Hailey's busy acting schedule.

&gt; In 2007 Leisha Hailey started another band called Uh Huh Her with Camila Grey and Alicia Warrington.

&gt; As of now Uh Huh Her consists of Leisha Hailey and Camila Grey. Read more on Last.fm.

Darren Aronofsky)  Re-watch: a glorious, melancholy look at a character who would otherwise be so easy to dismiss as just a clown.  Mickey Rourke's performance is achingly raw, &amp; framed in such a thoughtful, gentle way.  I paid particular attention to Marisa Tomei in this viewing, &amp; she does a great job matching Rourke.  This movie has an honesty that I don't come across all that often, it looks at pride &amp; humanity in a profound way.  I'd never have thought a movie about a professional wrestler could be so moving, it has to be experienced to be believed.  **10/10**

***Bunny and the Bull*** (2009; d. Paul King)  Having revisited all 3 series of BBC's *The Mighty Boosh* over the summer, I noted how much director King's wonderfully creative, fantastic looking worlds elevated the already great comedy of Julian Barret &amp; Noel Fielding, &amp; allowed them to let their imaginations go wild.  That led me to this movie, which was very disappointing.  I'd understand better if it had been done before King's time on *Boosh*, but it was made after.  It doesn't even look as good as a TV show, despite having some of King's trademark surrealist touch.  Lead actor Edward Hogg is conspicuously dull, leaving co-star Simon Farnaby unable to fill a vacuum.  The weird road trip the two go on becomes tiresome soon, &amp; the appearances of *Boosh* players don't help much.  King decided to put a genuine sob story at the core &amp; dress it up in fantastically comic style, &amp; there was no payoff for me.  The whole thing felt about an hour too long.  **3 / 10**

***Private Life*** (2018; d. Tamara Jenkins)  The good: this movie stars Paul Giamatti (love 'em) &amp; Kathryn Hahn (sign me up), &amp; is written &amp; directed by Tamara Jenkins (*Savages*, *Slums of Beverly Hills*).  I didn't hesitate to watch due to these names.  However, I wish someone had warned me in advance of the following: *this is a 2-hour movie about a middle aged couple trying desperately to have a baby*.

It's an inescapable truth for the entire running time, &amp; the charm &amp; chemistry of the lead actors, the supporting cast, &amp; Jenkins' deft direction can't change that.  Namely, it's a subject matter that I don't relate to, &amp; have no interest in.  It's a perfectly competent movie that didn't move the needle for me.  I didn't hate, or even particularly dislike this movie, but none of its charms or wisdoms worked on me.  **4 / 10**

***DJ Shadow - Live!  In Tune and On Time*** (2004; d. Eric Koziol)  DJ Shadow does a show at Brixton Academy, sounds great (not necessarily the DVD audio, an unremarkable Dolby mix) but Shadow is not good with banter (he introduces the show as ""In tune and in time"") &amp; resorts to just saying the names of his albums to get a crowd response.  The music is the thing, &amp; it's very good.  Three video screens behind Shadow try to do 99% of the visual stimulation, &amp; I found myself taking my eyes off the TV &amp; just listening.  **7 / 10**

***Aardvark*** (2017; d. Brian Shoaf)  Indie comedy-drama (maybe just ""drama"") featuring Zachary Quinto as Josh, a guy who is struggling with mental illness, &amp; Jenny Slate as Emily, his therapist.  The first 15 minutes were promising, it seemed smart &amp; cleverly amusing, &amp; I really liked Jenny Slate in *Obvious Child*.  Then it just started spinning its wheels.  The movie never gives itself over to the idea that its okay to laugh at Josh &amp; his weirdness, &amp; Slate is just dry.  Jon Hamm shows up &amp; does that thing he does so well where he squints at people when he's talking, but his character doesn't do much to enrich the movie.  Good themes &amp; subject matter, but there's just no juice here.  **4 / 10**

***Watchmen*** (2009; d. Zack Snyder)  Re-watch: never read the comic, which, from reading opinions on this movie, seems to help with my appreciation for it.  Love the characters &amp; their dynamics, the violence is visceral &amp; at times stunning.  The Cold War setting is a stark reminder of what a terrifying time that was, that may be lost on some younger viewers.  The idea that this makes it feel ""dated"" is absurd.

The subversion of the idea of superheroes &amp; their motivations is strong, &amp; the explorations of the characters &amp; their individual / shared histories is reliably interesting.  This is also a great looking movie.  My one notable problem is with the music cues, I have no idea how so many smart ideas can be so fully realized on the screen by such clever people while co-existing with such dopey music cues.  Fortunately, for a 3+ hour movie, there are only a handful of them, but when they happen it's like nails on a chalkboard.  **9 / 10**

***The Doors*** (1991; d. Oliver Stone)  Re-watch: I never had any real emotional attachment to The Doors, but I have enjoyed their music for a long time, &amp; think Jim Morrison is a great figure in American rock n' roll history.  So the disappointments in this movie (which stood out more than any other viewing I've had) are not hard to bear.  This time around I only really enjoyed the music segments, Stone went all-out &amp; they sound fantastic on the blu-ray's DTS soundtrack on a full surround sound audio setup.  Also no question Val Kilmer's commitment to the role is total, &amp; he's interesting to watch.  Stone makes the movie look good (I noticed how much the lighting style looks so similar to Stone's *Natural Born Killers*, it's like they were shot at the same time).

On the negative side, I'd say Meg Ryan is miscast but I don't know anything about Pamela Courson.  Regardless, Ryan doesn't feel right in the movie, she's a romantic comedy fixture as far as I'm concerned &amp; brings no edge or weight to this movie.  As Ray Manzarek, Kyle MacLachlan gets the lion's share of awful, corny dialogue, a pretty thankless role.  Kevin Dillon is bad too, I can't unsee him from his role in *Platoon*, &amp; the handful of lines he gets are his John Densmore commenting on how ""weird"" everyone is, while wearing tie-dyed frilly shirts, of course.

The supporting cast &amp; characters are lame, in a nutshell, &amp; it's unfortunate that Stone chose to immortalize Morrison as a cliche rock star drunk never without a bottle in hand.  I had a friend who had a similar need for attention &amp; worked the aggressive / vulnerable dynamic that Morrison uses with his friends, &amp; it feels genuine.  A friend like that is rewarding but also a terrible burden sometimes.

Stone was on such a tear from the mid-80s through the 90s, but I guess I've finally accepted that *The Doors* is not a great movie nor a great biopic, but as I noted I'm not very attached to The Doors.  It's more disappointing that Stone didn't match the other fantastic movies he made during that era.  **7 / 10**

***Sherlock Holmes*** (2009; d. Guy Ritchie)  Re-watch: Robert Downey Jr. is hilarious in this, first viewing was just taking in the spectacle but this time around I was locked on to the wide range of funny things he does in this movie.  Jude Law is no comedy slouch either, but he doesn't get to match Downey here.  Plenty of fun to be had here, looking forward to re-watching the sequel next week.  **8 / 10**",,,,,False,False,[],False,,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",,,False,,True,t3_9wdwhg,,,,/r/flicks/comments/9wdwhg/what_movies_have_you_watched_this_week/e9kou05/,public,,,,,,1542054079.0,r/flicks,0,,,,,,1325910306.0,,,1545304451.0,,,

I haven't disliked a movie so much in a while. It's the worst kind of melodrama where it feels like the director thinks he's making some profound piece of cinema, when it's just a poorly written cheesy melodramatic cliche piece of crap. It's one of those films that seems to exist solely to get nominated for best adapted screenplay and maybe get a best picture nod so the Oscars can go on about some political topic (kinda like the Post, although much worse film making).

I could spend ages going on about this film, so I will. Steve Carrell is fine given the script he's working with, but why the hell did they cast Holly Flax as his ex? It is  so unnecessary and just makes me think of him as Michael Scott throughout the movie. The movie's first half is non linear for no reason with parts that don't have any grounding to know where you are, so it just makes it confusing to follow cause you don't know where in the timeline you are. The writing is all cheesy and just sounds like movie talk, I haven't rolled my eyes so much at a film this year. It switches perspective constantly between Carrell and Chalamet, and it makes it feel really unfocused.

The editing and pacing are awful. Apart from the unnecessary non-linear first half, the film feels like it should end at the halfway point, but just keeps going and drags on and on past multiple points where it feels it should end. There's so many Fucking montage sequences with standard indie music playing over it of heavy reverb guitar with some syncopated electric beat, they are just awful. It's emotionally manipulative and nothing feels earned, just using cliche flashbacks to Chalamet as a kid cause the screenwriter couldn't think of a more interesting way to build their characters. And the ending has some Fucking political message so it makes you feel like it had a point that it doesn't earn, mainly so it can get academy award nominations.

So yeah, I really didn't like it. I guess it was in focus, so it gets a point for that. Other than that, pretty bad.

&gt; Amsterdam-based band Jagd was founded by guitarist Jos Neering and drummer Timo Mes, who had been friends for years, but strikingly never played music together before. In 2014 the two joined forces with bassplayer Luuk Meijer, with whom Jos had been playing with in another band for several years. There, they had already begun to develop their typical sound based on heavy, but playful basslines and sharp and energetic guitars. As of august 2014 singer Nanne van der Linden completed the band, that soon adopted the name Jagd. Jagd makes indie, heavily influenced by garage and punk. Their intense sound is completed by stonerriffs, pop hooks, vocal effects and the occassional synthesizer. After a year of songwriting and rehearsing, the band presented her first single on the 13th of november 2015 in a sold out Winston Kingdom. 2015 ended great, with a 4th place for debut ’Ritalin’ in the Dutch Indie Chart Top 100 of 2015. 2016 started out just as great, with being voted best band by both the audience and a professional jury at Q’s best, the bandcompetition by Q-Factory (Amsterdam Pop Academy).
The jury praised Jagd both for their music as for their presentation, calling Jagd a close-knit band with guts, great energy and adventurous songs. According to the jury “They really got the crowd going. Great presentation, they had attitude, good suspense and they were convincing. It just hit the mark straight away.”

&gt; Jagd is working on a second EP, for which Brattwell Recordings (Cheatahs, The Vaccines) will do the mixing. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Sandra McCracken (born 16 June 1977 in St. Louis, Missouri) is an independent singer-songwriter. She currently resides in Nashville, Tennessee.

&gt; McCracken grew up in St. Louis, Missouri and attended Westminster Christian Academy. McCracken began her musical career shortly after graduating from Belmont University, in 1999. She independently released two albums, The Crucible and Gypsy Flat Road, in 2000 and 2001, respectively.

&gt; In late 2003, McCracken recorded Best Laid Plans with engineer, Ray Kennedy (Twang Trust) and world-renowned producer, Peter Collins. In the summer of 2004, McCracken signed the album to Shell Records in London, headed by UK music business legend Dave Robinson. Shell released the album in the UK, followed by two radio singles, ""Last Goodbye"" and ""No More Tears,"" which received significant airplay and attention across England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland.

&gt; In 2005, McCracken released The Builder and the Architect, an album of hymns.

&gt; The same team which worked on Best Laid Plans came together again in February 2006 to record album number five, Gravity / Love, which was released in September 2006.

&gt; McCracken lists her musical influences as Joni Mitchell, Neil Finn, David Gray, Emmylou Harris, Bob Dylan, and Johnny Cash. Read more on Last.fm.

Music shows - There’s a ton of venues in the Mission with shows nightly. Genres spanning noise to indie rock depending on the venue. Notable venues: The Chapel (my fave), Rickshaw Stop, Brick &amp; Mortar, El Rio, Elbo Room, Public Works. If you like to dance, The Make Out Room!

Mission Restaurants that I’ve eaten by myself at :-) - for tacos you can’t go wrong at La Taqueria, Pancho Villa taqueria, Taqueria Cancun. You should definitely check out Radio Habana Social Club. Reasonably priced and visually awesome. 

Borderlands is my favorite book store &amp; cafe. If you like fantasy / sci fi books, there’s no better book store in the city. Catch a movie at Alamo Drafthouse!

I’d recommend walking the length of Valencia street to check out the neighborhood and cap that hanging out for a bit at Dolores park. Take a book. You can drink and smoke weed there as well. One of the big photo ops of the city too. 

**Outside the Mission -** 

If you bike there’s some great options. You can bike through Golden Gate park through to the ocean with great views. Check out the bison paddock too. Or you can bike from the Ferry building, past Fisherman’s wharf, into the Presidio and across the Golden Gate bridge. (There’s a gnarly hill you’ll want to scope out first). 

Museums: SF MoMA during the day (along with Yerba Buena garden). It’s great. Cal Academy nightlife is an awesome 21+ night event with bars throughout the museum. If you’re on dating apps, it’s a great date spot. Exploratorium has a night event too. 

Marina district: there’s a ton of great restaurants on Chestnut. You can then walk over to Palace of Fine Arts and then out to the marina / beach to catch the sunset over the Golden Gate bridge. 

If you rent a car: Fort Funston has some great little hikes and cliffs on the ocean to check out. Mt Tam, on the other side of the Golden Gate bridge, also provides views of SF. I would recommend driving down the coast and up into Big Basin Redwoods State Park (to the visitor center). It’s like a 4 hour drive in total but amazingly beautiful. Big ole redwoods!

**SF realities**: There’s a ton of homelessness here. Close second to NYC IMO. Most of it revolves around mental health &amp; IV drug use IMO. You won’t see it everywhere in the city but don’t be surprised if you run into poop / needles on the sidewalk on Market St, Mission St and in the Tenderloin. Crime here feels pretty low however. I’m a dude so YMMV. It’s also balls expensive here. On par with Manhattan &amp; Santa Monica.  

There’s good public transit here for a big city (vs LA, NYC, Philly, Boston). Get a clipper card if you want to run around the city. The issue is that there are different public transit providers so you may want to get a mobile app to sort it all (Transit?). I stick to BART and hoof it everywhere else. Lyft, don’t Uber, if you have a bigger budget.

&gt; Life began for Kamasi Washington on February 18, 1981 in Los Angeles, California. In the Washington family music was more of a prerequisite than a privilege. But Kamasi never saw it that way, his love for music began at first sound. His father, Rickey Washington is a professional saxophonist by night and a high school music teacher by day. Kamasi’s mother, Valerie Washington is an accomplished flutist who fell in love with the world of science and became a high school chemistry teacher after her stint as a genetic researcher. By the age of two Kamasi had already began to play the drums and piano, the only thing that kept him away from the wind instruments at that early age was his lack of dental development. He began his exploration into the world of the reeds and brass when he was about seven and his father gave him a clarinet. By the age of twelve Kamasi had found his voice in the form of a tenor saxophone, in fact it was the same saxophone that his father played in high school. 

&gt; Over the next year Kamasi’s development and devotion to music had out grown his academic environment. So he transferred from The Los Angeles Center of Enriched Studies (one the top academic high schools in the nation) and enrolled into the Hamilton High School Music Academy. It was around this time that Kamasi also joined The Multi School Jazz Band (M.S.J.B.), an assembly of the finest young jazz musicians in Los Angeles County and led by Reginald Andrews the same man that taught Kamasi’s father in high school. Because of the sheer vastness of talent that he was surrounded by it was in The Multi School Jazz Band that Kamasi was most inspired during his high school years. Through M.S.J.B. Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi’s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as “The Young Jazz Giants”. 
This fiery group of “Young Giants” wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year “The Young Jazz Giants” had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. 

&gt; After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson’s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album “In My Time” which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi’s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called “Bird Man Records” heard him playing with “The Young Jazz Giants” and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the “big break” for “The Young Jazz Giants” but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after its completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay “ready and waiting” for too long, thus “The Young Jazz Giants” unofficially disbanded. 

&gt; Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called “The Next Step” and that’s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking. 

&gt; (2) Kamasi Washington didn't pick up a saxophone until he was 13 years old, but by that point, he'd been playing several other instruments. That's when he found his calling. Within a couple years, he was the lead tenor saxophonist at Hamilton High School Music Academy in his native Los Angeles. After graduation, he attended UCLA to study ethnomusicology. While enrolled at UCLA, he recorded a self-titled album with Young Jazz Giants, a quartet he had formed with Cameron Graves and brothers Ronald Bruner, Jr. and Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner, released in 2004. From that point, Washington continually performed and recorded with an impressive variety of major artists across several genres, including Snoop Dogg, Raphael Saadiq, Gerald Wilson, McCoy Tyner, George Duke, and PJ Morton. In 2014 alone, Washington demonstrated tremendous range with appearances on Broken Bells' After the Disco, Harvey Mason's Chameleon, Stanley Clarke's Up, and Flying Lotus' You're Dead!, among other albums that covered indie rock, contemporary and progressive jazz, and experimental electronic music. 

&gt;  The following year, Washington contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly and finally debuted as a leader with The Epic, released on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label. An expansive triple album nearly three hours in duration, it involved the other three-quarters of Young Jazz Giants -- by then part of his larger ten piece collective, altnerately known as The Next Step and West Coast Get Down-- string orchestra and choir conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. 

&gt;  The Epic was a critical and commerial success. Not only did it land at number three on the jazz charts, it also found its way on to independent albums and heatseekers charts as well. Washington and his band were not only able to tour the U.S., but to play in Europe and Japan as well. ~ Andy Kellman

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD ""Edgy In Brixton"" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London. The DVD contains a full live performance of the debut album Costello Music, B-Sides from various singles and a new song called Pretty Like a Girl. Extras on the DVD include the band being asked questions by members of The Fratellis' website, and on the deluxe edition, highlights from the T In The Park 2007 festival. It was released in the United States on the 30 October 2007

&gt; 2007-2008: Here We Stand

&gt; On November 20, 2007, it was announced on the Fratellis' official website that work had begun on the second album in rehearsal space in Glasgow. The band stated that they are self-producing the album and have their own studio to record in. Recording finished on January 13, 2008.

About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. The first single from the album was called ""Mistress Mabel"" and was released on May 26, 2008. The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd.

&gt; A Fine Frenzy is a band led by Alison Sudol (born December 23, 1984 in Seattle, Washington), an American singer, songwriter and pianist. They released their first studio album One Cell In The Sea on July 17, 2007.

&gt; Born in Seattle to dramatic-arts teacher parents, Alison moved to Los Angeles, US at the age of five. With her newly single mother, Alison moved frequently around the city. She developed a strong love for the fantastic literary worlds of CS Lewis, EB White, Lewis Carroll and Charles Dickens, while becoming a passionate author in her own right.

&gt; In an interview with www.spinner.com Alison Sudol shares how she came up with the band's name ""(I) had a bunch of books open on a table, ""a fine frenzy"" jumped off a page of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' [Shakespeare] and it was just right, though every now and then I wonder if it's a bit ... flowery.""

&gt; Alison also immersed herself in classical music, Motown, Aretha Franklin, swing bands, Ella Fitzgerald, Elton John, Louis Armstrong, the Beatles, Technicolor movies and classic 1950's television.

&gt; After teaching herself to play piano, Alison increasingly invested her internal narratives into song form. She found solace in the melodic melancholia of new global British bands Aqualung, Radiohead, Coldplay, Keane, etc... She was also moved by the diatonic minimalism of Philip Glass and the transportive allure of Icelandic music (Björk, Sigur Rós). She graduated from Delphi Academy Los Angeles in 2001. Inspired, Alison Sudol developed the sound of A Fine Frenzy - hypnotic piano arrangements under classic American melody fused into irresistible, atmospheric songs with the power to reach around the world.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/9ace6db96e75f2d4ec2e7b2cabadcd7f.png)  

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

&gt; Despite having obvious musical chops, success has by no means been handed to Search The City on a silver platter. And much like a beautiful stone sculpture, this act’s final shape was first cut with sharp chisels and pounded with heavy hammers, before being rubbed smooth with rough sandpaper. As your high school gym teacher always said: no pain, no gain.

&gt; This Detroit, MI band recorded their first Tooth and Nail full-length, A Fire So Big the Heavens Can See It, in St. Cloud, FL with James Paul Wisner, who has also produced Dashboard Confessional, Underoath, and The Academy Is. While making this CD, the band fought off small town cabin fever, was restricted to bicycle transportation, and even shared a lake with an alligator. But such ordeals are colorful stories for another time because these guys are simply thrilled (but not to death) with the finished product.

&gt; The track “To the Moon for All I Care” is one of the group’s favorite new tunes. On the surface, one might assume it is based around what Ralph Kramden always told his wife Alice on the old The Honeymooners show. But as drummer Adam McMillion explains it, this song goes far deeper than that.

&gt; “The song is about our favorite movie, Danny Deckchair, which is about this guy that’s kind of fed up with his girlfriend who is not very faithful. And his job is really boring, so he decides to attach these balloons to his fold-up deckchair and he flies away,” McMillion says. When he finally lands, he’s in a faraway town, miles from everything and everyone he knows. “He kind of gets to start his life over, and we always thought that’s just such a cool concept,” McMillion continues. In fact, this song’s main character demands at one point, “Tell me about my future ‘cause I already know my past.”

&gt; Another noteworthy song has the intriguing title of “Detroit Is Built on Secrets”. This one takes on some of the nasty rumors oftentimes spread about rock bands – even about nice guys like Search The City. “So this is what we’re up against in this city of secrets,” states its anti-gossip lyric. But even when confronted with obvious lies, this thoughtful band still finds room for a little self-examination. “In the bridge it says, “Oh my God, forgive me for who I’m not,”” McMillion elaborates. “All these rumors are going around,” he continues, “but we’re still not the people we want to be. We’re still not the people God wants us to be. It’s just a cry out; kind of a confession. We wanna be better. We realize that we’re not who we should be.”

&gt; These closely bonded band members, which also include Alex Sheldon (guitar), Jim Czech (guitar), and Josh Frost (vocals), draw artistic inspiration from many loud and noisy sources, then translate these harsher sounds into surprisingly melodic, highly emotional songs.

&gt; “We’re more influenced by hardcore music than anything else,” Frost says of Search The City’s sound. “It doesn’t show so much because we’re pretty pop-y in parts. But collectively, we all love bands like Jimmy Eat World and bands like that.” So how would they describe their unique style? “We’d probably say progressive rock or something like that,” answers Frost.

&gt; Although the group is proud of their new CD, this band is truly in their element in concert. “Live is definitely Search The City’s favorite thing to do,” McMillion says without any hesitation. “It’s a chance to release a lot of emotion. We all love what we do onstage where we’ll just look at each other and just start laughing and smiling because it’s so much fun. Playing live is definitely the best part about being in a band.”

&gt; Search The City’s original nucleus, Sheldon, Czech, and McMillion, came up with the band’s Mapquest-like moniker while seeking out other musicians to complete their final lineup. “They named it that because they were looking for all of the different members, all over different cities,” Frost explains. “That meant all over Michigan. And because I was living in Florida at the time, they just called it Search The City.”

&gt; No doubt, Search The City succeeded in getting all their geographic coordinates correct.

&gt; After the band went their separate ways and onto some side projects, Frost and Czech have announced via Facebook and AboslutePunk.com has reported that they are back together and writing a second full-length album that's due out in the spring of 2012. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD ""Edgy In Brixton"" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London. The DVD contains a full live performance of the debut album Costello Music, B-Sides from various singles and a new song called Pretty Like a Girl. Extras on the DVD include the band being asked questions by members of The Fratellis' website, and on the deluxe edition, highlights from the T In The Park 2007 festival. It was released in the United States on the 30 October 2007

&gt; 2007-2008: Here We Stand

&gt; On November 20, 2007, it was announced on the Fratellis' official website that work had begun on the second album in rehearsal space in Glasgow. The band stated that they are self-producing the album and have their own studio to record in. Recording finished on January 13, 2008.

&gt; On February 22, 2008, they played a small show for fans at Queen Margaret Union to debut new songs from the upcoming album. About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. The first single from the album was called ""Mistress Mabel"" and was released on May 26, 2008. The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd. The Fratellis released a deluxe edition of Here We Stand internationally on December the 8th. The CD includes a new song titled 'Moriarty's Last Stand' and the accompanying DVD includes ""The Year Of The Thief"" (A documentary of the band on the road in the US); A live show filmed on June 18th 2008 at the Fillmore, San Francisco; performances of Milk and Money, Flathead and Mistress Mabel from Abbey Road Studios and the videos for the singles Mistress Mabel and Look Out Sunshine!
On April, 22 2010, both singer Jon Lawler and bassist Barry Wallace posted messages on their forum saying the band are unlikely to record together again soon.

&gt; The Fratellis have announced during June 2012 that they have decided to reform to help raise money for The Eilidh Brown Memorial Fund on the 15th of June at the MacRobert Centre in Stirling. The band plans on announcing more dates for later in the year.
The band then announced an extensive UK tour during December 2012 to take place in April 2013. During the UK tour, 3 more songs were debuted live; ""She's Not Gone Yet (But She's Leaving), Seven Days and Whiskey Saga.
On February 4th 2013, The Fratellis announced they had finished recording their third album, which was revealed to be called We Need Medicine with a release date of October 7th 2013. ""Seven Nights Seven Days"" was released as a single on September 29th. The album was recorded in Glasgow with Jon Fratelli and Stuart McCredie on production duties.

&gt; On the 24th of April 2013 it was announced that The Fratellis would be headlining Brownstock Festival in Essex on Sunday the 1st of September.

&gt; On the 22nd June 2013 The Fratellis headlined New College Commemoration Ball, a white-tie Ball set in the grounds of New College, Oxford.

&gt; Songwriter Oren Lavie (Tel Aviv, Israel), who has drawn comparisons in the press to Nick Drake, the Beatles and Crosby Stills &amp; Nash, released his debut album “The Opposite Side Of The Sea” on March 10th, 2009 on his own imprint, A Quarter Past Wonderful, which he started with tastemaker and current KCRW host Chris Douridas.  Says Douridas, a 27-year veteran of radio, “I've never been so motivated to help an artist get his music out into the world until I met Oren. He is incredibly special. It's rare every song in an artist's catalogue moves me like Oren’s do.""

&gt; The album is as eclectic as Oren’s home bases of Tel Aviv, Israel (where he was born), Berlin Germany (where he recorded the album), and Los Angeles, CA (the home of his new label). It was released in Europe and immediately garnered great press with Uncut raving in a four-star review that the album is “cinematic and mellow, like Nick Drake in a cheerful summer bonnet…”

&gt; Many people in the US will be familiar with Oren’s music as his album track ‘Her Morning Elegance’ was featured in a national ad campaign for Chevy Malibu. He also wrote the end credit “A Dance ‘Round the Memory Tree” for the film The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian joining Regina Spektor and Hanne Hukkelberg on the soundtrack.

&gt; Born in Tel-Aviv, Israel, Oren began his creative journey as a playwright. At the age of 21 he wrote and directed a play for the Israeli Fringe Theater Festival, which won the awards for best newcomer writer and director. He later moved to London on a scholarship to attend the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts. While still at school he wrote a play he later directed in an Off West-end theater to critical acclaim. The production was named by Time-Out London as one of the best 5 shows in London during its run. Oren moved to NY where he gradually began to shift his focus from playwriting to a shorter form of storytelling, the song. Two years later he relocated to Berlin and began work on The Opposite Side of The Sea.

&gt; In 2007 the album was released in Europe, then found its way to the KCRW playlist in LA. Shortly after that the album track ‘Her Morning Elegance’ was synched to a Chevrolet Malibu TV campaign. Oren, who does not own a television and has not driven a car for 10 years, continues to ride the bus. With the earnings from the TV ad he started his own label in the US, named it, then renamed it, changed it again and finally decided to call it Quarter Past Wonderful. He then released The Opposite Side Of The Sea on iTunes US, where it climbed to #30 on the charts.

&gt; Oren Lavie's music doesn't come right at you through the front door; its elliptical nature is mysterious and dense and remains slightly unresolved. His vignettes of life are heartbreaking. One can hear his playwright past in his narratives as his songs unfold like a collection of short stories in musical poetic form.

The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US.

The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/9ace6db96e75f2d4ec2e7b2cabadcd7f.png)  

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

&gt; A London, UK production &amp; remix team. Formed from the ashes of Simian in 2005 its members are James Ford and Jas Shaw. In addition to his work with Simian Mobile Disco, James Ford is a producer and has worked for bands such as the Arctic Monkeys, Peaches and Klaxons.

&gt; Simian Mobile Disco was originally formed as a traveling DJ duet, playing on the side of their early four-piece band Simian. They ultimately released a number of low profile singles, such as ""The Count"" on Kitsuné Music, but arguably gained more fame for their remixes of artists such as Muse, Klaxons, The Go! Team, Air and others. In 2006, Kitsuné released SMD's underground hit ""Hustler"", which features a vocal performance from New York singer Char Johnson.

&gt; Musically, Simian Mobile Disco is known for heavily stylized tracks —often with minimal instrumentation— that associate themselves with a particular hook (vocal or instrumental —see mix of ""Whoo! Alright, Yeah...Uh Huh"" by The Rapture), which is repeated throughout the track. There is often a breakdown (occasionally more —see mix of ""Magick"" by Klaxons) comprising noise, drums and sometimes synths and vocals.

&gt; The band's debut album, Attack Decay Sustain Release was released on 18 June 2007 on Wichita Recordings. Among the tracks included on it are ""Hustler"", ""Tits and Acid"", ""I Believe"", ""Hot Dog"" and lead single ""It's the Beat"", which features Ninja from UK indie band The Go! Team on vocals. The album contains five new tracks, and the European version includes a bonus disc. The album was preceded by two mix compilations in April and May, for the ""Bugged Out"" and ""Go Commando"" series respectively.

&gt; SMD supported Klaxons at Brixton Academy on the 5 December 2007 and The Chemical Brothers at Aintree Pavilion on 9 December 2007 and Brighton Centre on 12 December 2007. SMD made a mix for Mixmag that came free with the January 2008 issue of Mixmag. While working on their second studio album, they released a collection of remixed SMD originals entitled Sample and Hold, which contains eleven tracks and was released in the UK on July 28, 2008. A North American date has not yet been announced.

&gt; In January 2009, they announced on their Myspace page that a new album was supposed to come out in 2009. Soon after that, they released a new track ""Synthesise"", on 12 February, through a music video (directed by Kate Moross and Alex Sushon) that ""features live visual accompaniment"" for the track. Two days later, a new song was broadcast on the BBC Radio 1 named ""10,000 Horses Can't Be Wrong"", soon followed by the release on 6 March of the official music video on their YouTube channel.

&gt; Their sophomore studio album Temporary Pleasure was finally announced on the 6 May, featuring many guests that they have encountered by their work as producers or their worldly tour including Gruff Rhys of Super Furry Animals, Alexis Taylor of Hot Chip, Beth Ditto of Gossip, and Chris Keating of Yeasayer.

The Harley is a pub which has some good nights on in. (Also bloody good burgers) Code is a relatively new club and has more EDM type music.

&gt; The Murmurs were an American alternative pop music duo composed of singers/songwriters Leisha Hailey and Heather Grody. They began performing in 1991 while the duo were both students of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. With their self-released, debut album, Who We Are, the duo quickly attracted a cult following on the East Village club circuit. In 1994, The Murmurs signed with MCA Records. They released their self-titled LP the same year. The duo expanded into a four-woman group in 1997 with the addition of bassist Sheri Ozeki and drummer Sherri Solinger. They released Pristine Smut in 1997 and, a year later, Blender.

&gt; Hailey and Grody rejoined in 2001 as a new band entitled Gush. But the band Gush later split up due to Hailey's busy acting schedule.

&gt; In 2007 Leisha Hailey started another band called Uh Huh Her with Camila Grey and Alicia Warrington.

&gt; As of now Uh Huh Her consists of Leisha Hailey and Camila Grey. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; In November 1968, millions of double LPs were shipped to record stores worldwide ahead of that tumultuous year’s most anticipated music event: the November 22nd release of The BEATLES (soon to be better known as ‘The White Album’). With their ninth studio album, The Beatles took the world on a whole new trip, side one blasting off with the exhilarating rush of a screaming jet escorting Paul McCartney’s punchy, exuberant vocals on “Back In The U.S.S.R.” “Dear Prudence” came next, John Lennon warmly beckoning his friend and all of us to “look around.” George Harrison imparted timeless wisdom in “While My Guitar Gently Weeps,” singing, “With every mistake we must surely be learning.” For 50 years, ‘The White Album’ has invited its listeners to venture forth and explore the breadth and ambition of its music, delighting and inspiring each new generation in turn. On November 9, The Beatles will release a suite of lavishly presented ‘White Album’ packages (Apple Corps Ltd./Capitol/UMe). The album’s 30 tracks are newly mixed by producer Giles Martin and mix engineer Sam Okell in stereo and 5.1 surround audio, joined by 27 early acoustic demos and 50 session takes, most of which are previously unreleased in any form.

&gt; This is the first time The BEATLES (‘White Album’) has been remixed and presented with additional demos and session recordings. The album’s sweeping new edition follows 2017’s universally acclaimed Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band Anniversary Edition releases. To create the new stereo and 5.1 surround audio mixes for ‘The White Album,’ Martin and Okell worked with an expert team of engineers and audio restoration specialists at Abbey Road Studios in London. All the new ‘White Album’ releases include Martin’s new stereo album mix, sourced directly from the original four-track and eight-track session tapes. Martin’s new mix is guided by the album’s original stereo mix produced by his father, George Martin.

&gt; The minimalist artwork for ‘The White Album’ was created by artist Richard Hamilton, one of Britain’s leading figures in the creation and rise of pop art. The top-loading gatefold sleeve’s stark white exterior had ‘The BEATLES’ embossed on the front and printed on the spine with the album’s catalogue number. Early copies of ‘The White Album’ were also individually numbered on the front, which has also been done for the new edition’s Super Deluxe package. The set’s six CDs and Blu-ray disc are housed in a slipsleeved 164-page hardbound book, with pull-out reproductions of the original album’s four glossy color portrait photographs of John, Paul, George, and Ringo, as well as the album’s large fold-out poster with a photo collage on one side and lyrics on the other. The beautiful book is illustrated with rare photographs, reproductions of handwritten and notated lyrics, previously unpublished photos of recording sheets and tape boxes, and reproduced original ‘White Album’ print ads. The book’s comprehensive written pieces include new introductions by Paul McCartney and Giles Martin, and in-depth chapters covering track-by-track details and session notes reflecting The Beatles’ year between the release of ‘Sgt. Pepper’ and recording sessions for ‘The White Album,’ the band’s July 28 1968 “Mad Day Out” photo shoot in locations around London, the album artwork, the lead-up and execution of the album’s blockbuster release, and its far-ranging influence, written by Beatles historian, author and radio producer Kevin Howlett; journalist and author John Harris; and Tate Britain’s Senior Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art Andrew Wilson. 

&gt; Much of the initial songwriting for ‘The White Album’ was done in Rishikesh, India between February and April 1968, when John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr joined a course at the Maharishi’s Academy of Transcendental Meditation. In a postcard to Ringo, who had returned to England before the others, John wrote, “we’ve got about two L.P.s worth of songs now so get your drums out.”

&gt; During the last week of May, The Beatles gathered at George’s house in Esher, Surrey, where they recorded acoustic demos for 27 songs. Known as the Esher Demos, all 27 recordings are included in the new edition’s Deluxe and Super Deluxe packages, sourced from the original four-track tapes. Twenty-one of the demoed songs were recorded during the subsequent studio sessions, and 19 were ultimately finished and included on ‘The White Album.’

&gt; The Beatles’ studio sessions for The BEATLES (‘White Album’) began on May 30, 1968 at Abbey Road Studios. In the 20 weeks that followed, The Beatles devoted most of their time to sessions there for the new album, with some recording also done at Trident Studios. The final session for the album took place at Abbey Road on October 16, a 24-hour marathon with producer George Martin to sequence the double album’s four sides and to complete edits and cross-fades between its songs. The Beatles’ approach to recording for ‘The White Album’ was quite different from what they had done for ‘Sgt. Pepper.’ Rather than layering individually overdubbed parts on a multi-track tape, many of the ‘White Album’ session takes were recorded to four-track and eight-track tape as group performances with a live lead vocal. The Beatles often recorded take after take for a song, as evidenced by the Super Deluxe set’s Take 102 for “Not Guilty,” a song that was not included on the album. This live-take recording style resulted in a less intricately structured, more unbridled album that would shift the course of rock music and cut a path for punk and indie rock. 

&gt; The Beatles’ newly adopted method of recording all through the night was time consuming and exhausting for their producer, George Martin. Martin had other duties, including his management of AIR (Associated Independent Recording), and he had also composed the orchestral score for The Beatles’ animated feature film, Yellow Submarine, released in July 1968. After the first three months of ‘White Album’ sessions, Martin took a three-week holiday from the studio, entrusting the control room to his young assistant Chris Thomas and balance engineer Ken Scott. Scott had taken the place of engineer Geoff Emerick, who left the sessions in mid-July. On August 22, Ringo Starr also left the sessions, returning 11 days later to find his drum kit adorned with flowers from his bandmates. While the sessions’ four and a half months of long hours and many takes did spark occasional friction in the studio, the session recordings reveal the closeness, camaraderie, and collaborative strengths within the band, as well as with George Martin.

&gt; The BEATLES (‘White Album’) was the first Beatles album to be released on the group’s own Apple Records label. Issued in both stereo and mono for the U.K. and in stereo for the U.S., the double album was an immediate bestseller, entering the British chart at number one and remaining there for eight of the 22 weeks it was listed. ‘The White Album’ also debuted at number one on the U.S. chart, holding the top spot for nine weeks of its initial 65-week chart run. In his glowing ‘White Album’ review for Rolling Stone, the magazine’s co-founder Jann Wenner declared: “It is the best album they have ever released, and only The Beatles are capable of making a better one.” In the U.S., ‘The White Album’ is 19-times platinum-certified by the RIAA and in 2000, it was inducted into the Recording Academy’s GRAMMY® Hall of Fame, recognizing “recordings of lasting qualitative or historical significance.”


&gt; ESHER DEMOS:

&gt; • The band had been in India with the Maharishi, some for 2 weeks and others for up to 2 months. 
&gt; 
&gt; • While there they wrote an incredible number of songs and so they decided – for the only time in their career – to get together to demo these prior to going into the studio for the recording sessions. 
&gt; 
&gt; • They went to George’s house in Esher and recorded them in one or two days on his new 4 track recorder. 
&gt; 
&gt; • Olivia still has the tapes and so Giles was able to re-visit the original tape to work on these demos. 
&gt; 
&gt; • They recorded 27 songs and we have been allowed to release all of them here. 
&gt; 
&gt; • 19 of them ended up on the White Album with the rest either being recorded by the band or as solo later or in the case of Sour Milk Sea being given to another singer for his solo album on Apple Records (Jackie Lomax).
&gt; 
&gt; • 7 have previously been released on Anthology, but they were mixed with the technology of the time and now Giles has been able to really clean them up and bring out the intimate nature of the recordings.
&gt; 
&gt; • Look on this as The Beatles Unplugged!!!
&gt; 
&gt; • One of the biggest things we learned through listening to the sessions, and which the fans can hear too via the inclusion of the studio chat and banter between takes, is that while this was certainly a time of change for the guys – growing up and maybe starting to grow apart too, it was NOT the miserable experience that has become history’s view of it. They are clearly having a blast playing as a band again and supporting each other with different ideas, working out how to approach parts, etc. They had FUN in the recording of this album, amongst the angst, and this shines through more than anyone has previously realized.

&gt; Life began for Kamasi Washington on February 18, 1981 in Los Angeles, California. In the Washington family music was more of a prerequisite than a privilege. But Kamasi never saw it that way, his love for music began at first sound. His father, Rickey Washington is a professional saxophonist by night and a high school music teacher by day. Kamasi’s mother, Valerie Washington is an accomplished flutist who fell in love with the world of science and became a high school chemistry teacher after her stint as a genetic researcher. By the age of two Kamasi had already began to play the drums and piano, the only thing that kept him away from the wind instruments at that early age was his lack of dental development. He began his exploration into the world of the reeds and brass when he was about seven and his father gave him a clarinet. By the age of twelve Kamasi had found his voice in the form of a tenor saxophone, in fact it was the same saxophone that his father played in high school. 

&gt; Over the next year Kamasi’s development and devotion to music had out grown his academic environment. So he transferred from The Los Angeles Center of Enriched Studies (one the top academic high schools in the nation) and enrolled into the Hamilton High School Music Academy. It was around this time that Kamasi also joined The Multi School Jazz Band (M.S.J.B.), an assembly of the finest young jazz musicians in Los Angeles County and led by Reginald Andrews the same man that taught Kamasi’s father in high school. Because of the sheer vastness of talent that he was surrounded by it was in The Multi School Jazz Band that Kamasi was most inspired during his high school years. Through M.S.J.B. Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi’s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as “The Young Jazz Giants”. 
This fiery group of “Young Giants” wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year “The Young Jazz Giants” had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. 

&gt; After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson’s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album “In My Time” which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi’s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called “Bird Man Records” heard him playing with “The Young Jazz Giants” and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the “big break” for “The Young Jazz Giants” but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after its completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay “ready and waiting” for too long, thus “The Young Jazz Giants” unofficially disbanded. 

&gt; Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called “The Next Step” and that’s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking. 

&gt; (2) Kamasi Washington didn't pick up a saxophone until he was 13 years old, but by that point, he'd been playing several other instruments. That's when he found his calling. Within a couple years, he was the lead tenor saxophonist at Hamilton High School Music Academy in his native Los Angeles. After graduation, he attended UCLA to study ethnomusicology. While enrolled at UCLA, he recorded a self-titled album with Young Jazz Giants, a quartet he had formed with Cameron Graves and brothers Ronald Bruner, Jr. and Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner, released in 2004. From that point, Washington continually performed and recorded with an impressive variety of major artists across several genres, including Snoop Dogg, Raphael Saadiq, Gerald Wilson, McCoy Tyner, George Duke, and PJ Morton. In 2014 alone, Washington demonstrated tremendous range with appearances on Broken Bells' After the Disco, Harvey Mason's Chameleon, Stanley Clarke's Up, and Flying Lotus' You're Dead!, among other albums that covered indie rock, contemporary and progressive jazz, and experimental electronic music. 

&gt;  The following year, Washington contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly and finally debuted as a leader with The Epic, released on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label. An expansive triple album nearly three hours in duration, it involved the other three-quarters of Young Jazz Giants -- by then part of his larger ten piece collective, altnerately known as The Next Step and West Coast Get Down-- string orchestra and choir conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. 

&gt;  The Epic was a critical and commerial success. Not only did it land at number three on the jazz charts, it also found its way on to independent albums and heatseekers charts as well. Washington and his band were not only able to tour the U.S., but to play in Europe and Japan as well. ~ Andy Kellman

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/9ace6db96e75f2d4ec2e7b2cabadcd7f.png)  

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

&gt; Life began for Kamasi Washington on February 18, 1981 in Los Angeles, California. In the Washington family music was more of a prerequisite than a privilege. But Kamasi never saw it that way, his love for music began at first sound. His father, Rickey Washington is a professional saxophonist by night and a high school music teacher by day. Kamasi’s mother, Valerie Washington is an accomplished flutist who fell in love with the world of science and became a high school chemistry teacher after her stint as a genetic researcher. By the age of two Kamasi had already began to play the drums and piano, the only thing that kept him away from the wind instruments at that early age was his lack of dental development. He began his exploration into the world of the reeds and brass when he was about seven and his father gave him a clarinet. By the age of twelve Kamasi had found his voice in the form of a tenor saxophone, in fact it was the same saxophone that his father played in high school. 

&gt; Over the next year Kamasi’s development and devotion to music had out grown his academic environment. So he transferred from The Los Angeles Center of Enriched Studies (one the top academic high schools in the nation) and enrolled into the Hamilton High School Music Academy. It was around this time that Kamasi also joined The Multi School Jazz Band (M.S.J.B.), an assembly of the finest young jazz musicians in Los Angeles County and led by Reginald Andrews the same man that taught Kamasi’s father in high school. Because of the sheer vastness of talent that he was surrounded by it was in The Multi School Jazz Band that Kamasi was most inspired during his high school years. Through M.S.J.B. Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi’s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as “The Young Jazz Giants”. 
This fiery group of “Young Giants” wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year “The Young Jazz Giants” had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. 

&gt; After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson’s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album “In My Time” which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi’s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called “Bird Man Records” heard him playing with “The Young Jazz Giants” and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the “big break” for “The Young Jazz Giants” but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after its completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay “ready and waiting” for too long, thus “The Young Jazz Giants” unofficially disbanded. 

&gt; Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called “The Next Step” and that’s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking. 

&gt; (2) Kamasi Washington didn't pick up a saxophone until he was 13 years old, but by that point, he'd been playing several other instruments. That's when he found his calling. Within a couple years, he was the lead tenor saxophonist at Hamilton High School Music Academy in his native Los Angeles. After graduation, he attended UCLA to study ethnomusicology. While enrolled at UCLA, he recorded a self-titled album with Young Jazz Giants, a quartet he had formed with Cameron Graves and brothers Ronald Bruner, Jr. and Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner, released in 2004. From that point, Washington continually performed and recorded with an impressive variety of major artists across several genres, including Snoop Dogg, Raphael Saadiq, Gerald Wilson, McCoy Tyner, George Duke, and PJ Morton. In 2014 alone, Washington demonstrated tremendous range with appearances on Broken Bells' After the Disco, Harvey Mason's Chameleon, Stanley Clarke's Up, and Flying Lotus' You're Dead!, among other albums that covered indie rock, contemporary and progressive jazz, and experimental electronic music. 

&gt;  The following year, Washington contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly and finally debuted as a leader with The Epic, released on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label. An expansive triple album nearly three hours in duration, it involved the other three-quarters of Young Jazz Giants -- by then part of his larger ten piece collective, altnerately known as The Next Step and West Coast Get Down-- string orchestra and choir conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. 

&gt;  The Epic was a critical and commerial success. Not only did it land at number three on the jazz charts, it also found its way on to independent albums and heatseekers charts as well. Washington and his band were not only able to tour the U.S., but to play in Europe and Japan as well. ~ Andy Kellman

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry.

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

&gt; Life began for Kamasi Washington on February 18, 1981 in Los Angeles, California. In the Washington family music was more of a prerequisite than a privilege. But Kamasi never saw it that way, his love for music began at first sound. His father, Rickey Washington is a professional saxophonist by night and a high school music teacher by day. Kamasi’s mother, Valerie Washington is an accomplished flutist who fell in love with the world of science and became a high school chemistry teacher after her stint as a genetic researcher. By the age of two Kamasi had already began to play the drums and piano, the only thing that kept him away from the wind instruments at that early age was his lack of dental development. He began his exploration into the world of the reeds and brass when he was about seven and his father gave him a clarinet. By the age of twelve Kamasi had found his voice in the form of a tenor saxophone, in fact it was the same saxophone that his father played in high school. 

&gt; Over the next year Kamasi’s development and devotion to music had out grown his academic environment. So he transferred from The Los Angeles Center of Enriched Studies (one the top academic high schools in the nation) and enrolled into the Hamilton High School Music Academy. It was around this time that Kamasi also joined The Multi School Jazz Band (M.S.J.B.), an assembly of the finest young jazz musicians in Los Angeles County and led by Reginald Andrews the same man that taught Kamasi’s father in high school. Because of the sheer vastness of talent that he was surrounded by it was in The Multi School Jazz Band that Kamasi was most inspired during his high school years. Through M.S.J.B. Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi’s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as “The Young Jazz Giants”. 
This fiery group of “Young Giants” wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year “The Young Jazz Giants” had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. 

&gt; After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson’s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album “In My Time” which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi’s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called “Bird Man Records” heard him playing with “The Young Jazz Giants” and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the “big break” for “The Young Jazz Giants” but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after its completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay “ready and waiting” for too long, thus “The Young Jazz Giants” unofficially disbanded. 

&gt; Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called “The Next Step” and that’s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking. 

&gt; (2) Kamasi Washington didn't pick up a saxophone until he was 13 years old, but by that point, he'd been playing several other instruments. That's when he found his calling. Within a couple years, he was the lead tenor saxophonist at Hamilton High School Music Academy in his native Los Angeles. After graduation, he attended UCLA to study ethnomusicology. While enrolled at UCLA, he recorded a self-titled album with Young Jazz Giants, a quartet he had formed with Cameron Graves and brothers Ronald Bruner, Jr. and Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner, released in 2004. From that point, Washington continually performed and recorded with an impressive variety of major artists across several genres, including Snoop Dogg, Raphael Saadiq, Gerald Wilson, McCoy Tyner, George Duke, and PJ Morton. In 2014 alone, Washington demonstrated tremendous range with appearances on Broken Bells' After the Disco, Harvey Mason's Chameleon, Stanley Clarke's Up, and Flying Lotus' You're Dead!, among other albums that covered indie rock, contemporary and progressive jazz, and experimental electronic music. 

&gt;  The following year, Washington contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly and finally debuted as a leader with The Epic, released on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label. An expansive triple album nearly three hours in duration, it involved the other three-quarters of Young Jazz Giants -- by then part of his larger ten piece collective, altnerately known as The Next Step and West Coast Get Down-- string orchestra and choir conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. 

&gt;  The Epic was a critical and commerial success. Not only did it land at number three on the jazz charts, it also found its way on to independent albums and heatseekers charts as well. Washington and his band were not only able to tour the U.S., but to play in Europe and Japan as well. ~ Andy Kellman

""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007.

&gt;  
&gt;During the *Cody* album cycle, the band frequently name-dropped  revived DIY cult favorites Dear Nora and Sun Kil Moon as pervasive  influences. As we pile into Knobbe’s station wagon on the way to lunch, a  Dear Nora rarities compilation is on the stereo, while a CD copy of Red  House Painters’ *Old Ramon* sits in the back pocket of the  driver’s seat. As much as Joyce Manor admire these artists who’ve stayed  true to whatever confounding whim suits them, the conversation after  turns to where they stand in 2018 and what might’ve happened if they  didn’t lack that careerist gene.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Warped Tour had made its final Vans-soled run through town and  that was the way bands like Joyce Manor could reach a mass audience  without the help of radio, MTV, or mainstream press. “The kids can’t get  enough of that stuff!” Johnson huffs in exasperation, wondering if  Joyce Manor could’ve parlayed the same songs and same albums into  something bigger, even if the band never seriously considered pursuing  the Warped Tour, offering dismissals like “We always thought it was  wack” or “It would’ve destroyed us.” Still, Johnson remembers the time  he was working at a record store where British skeeve-punkers Neck Deep  did an acoustic performance — “Nobody was there, and then they did  Warped Tour and now they’re as big as Joyce Manor?” Johnson asks. The  band replies in unison: “Bigger.”  
&gt;  
&gt;They also think back to their tour 2016 run supporting Modern  Baseball. “Brendan \[Lukens\] was like a YouTube celebrity,” in Johnson’s  view, not meant as a derogatory comment, but rather an explanation of  how MoBo “exploded harder than anything else in the scene.” Through  their Twitter, IRL fan outreach, and label-funded documentaries, the  message was: “You can get to know us.” But that lack of boundaries is  ultimately what destroyed Modern Baseball. Joyce Manor, by contrast,  “don’t hang out much,” are cryptic in their lyrical approach, less  forthcoming on social media.  
&gt;  
&gt;That’s probably for the best. “I would’ve been horrible,” Johnson  says about his teenage self, if he had access to Twitter. “I had a low  self-opinion and a desire to be center of attention, which is a cocktail  for being the most annoying guy in the world.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Knobbe concurs: “If I had the power to let everyone know how I was feeling at all times like teenagers now, I’d be so annoying.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Even now, our discussion about the things that have made indie rock  discourse so exhausting in 2018 remind me of the conversations I have  with fellow 30-somethings in group DMs rather than out in the open. We  grouse about the conflation of music and morals, the shift toward  quieter solo projects that don’t translate live, or just the fact that a  line on *Million Dollars*’ “Big Lie” will almost certainly be used  against them even if it’s meant sarcastically. “Girls can kinda be  controlling,” Johnson sings before delivering a typically  self-deprecating punctuation: “I wanna be controlled, I think it’d be  all right.”  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Even before I met with Joyce Manor, the lyrics of *Million Dollars To Kill Me*  hinted at a kind of exhaustion, or even finality. It’s hard not to read  into the final two songs being “Gone Tomorrow” — a drowsy ballad with  Oasis-inspired nonsense rhymes about the desperation to combat  ephemeral, internet-based living — and “Wildflowers,” a spare, sunlit,  and serene acoustic ditty that’s exactly what most would expect of an  eventual Barry Johnson solo project. Besides the passage of time,  Johnson notes: “I didn’t notice it when I was writing, but looking back,  I thought, ‘I’m writing about money a lot.'”  
&gt;  
&gt;“I’m Not the One” was prompted by Johnson’s musings over “Rich people  wanting to be good people” — Elon Musk, the USC Jimmy Iovine, and Andre  Young Academy, etc. — but it puts his own peers on trial:  
&gt;  
&gt;*Dog at the door who’s the king of hardcore*  
 *Because he’s always been*  
 *Booking the shows where they sell the most clothes*  
 *Cause they’re so limited*  
 *Trying to decide who’s good*  
 *And who’s just poor*  
 *Baby when we die we’re all gonna want some more*  
&gt;  
&gt;And there’s the title track that appears to consolidate all of the  undercurrents of artistic doubt, cultural burnout, and financial stress  into a firehose stream of self-pity:  
&gt;  
&gt;*She don’t wanna write a song*  
 *She knows exactly where and when it all went wrong*  
 *Besides it’s been too long*  
 *And she don’t wanna be a drag*  
 *She’s just indifferent to the old blue fact*  
 *That you can’t go back*  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s a somewhat misleading song. Despite its relatively  straightforward and sturdy verse-chorus presentation, all signifying  craft and maturity, “Million Dollars To Kill Me” found Johnson at his  most blindly juvenile: “It’s just about relationships and how some  shitty guy can mean a lot to somebody.” A close friend of Johnson’s, who  used to be in Joyce Manor for a while, invited him to his wedding in  Wisconsin. But the aforementioned shitty guy (“Someone I’ve got beef  with … nobody in the world likes this guy except one girl who works at  Whole Foods”) was also in the wedding, and so Johnson had to decline.  The two got into a screaming match. “Voices trembling, yelling … I  haven’t yelled at someone since I was a kid,” Johnson says. He claims he  wrote the song in about as long as it takes to play it.

#About This Game

 **VR Platforming Game** , that gives you the freedom to move across the environment with superhuman abilities. Conquer over 35 levels with new obstacles and challenges. Compete for the fastest times or explore the environment. Experience the freedom of movement.



 **Story** 

In the future, cities are not protected by superheroes, instead superheroes are built. Super Bots are human piloted robots engineered with super powers to protect and serve the people. TO THE TOP Academy is a training program to test your skills and see if you are capable of piloting one of these machines. So strap in and see if you can pass this challenge



https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/509250/extras/FreedomOfMovement.png?t=1531214921



Our core motivation for creating TO THE TOP was to create a movement mechanic that is simple to use, takes advantages of VR input, and feels very comfortable to play. We spent a year testing and tuning this system, until it felt like a movement system that was not only fun to use but also opened the door to create brand new gameplay that has not been seen in platforming games before.



-  **Climb** - Grab with one hand at a time, to move across surfaces, up over or around. You can climb 360 around objects.

-  **Leap** - Grab on with both hands, look at where you want to go and release to leap. Perform consecutive leaps to build up speed and power.

-  **Air Control** - While leaping through the air, you can control your fall with the direction you are looking.

-  **Skate** - Green surfaces can be skated on. Grab them, point in the direction you want to go and skate across the surface.

-  **Fly** - Equipped with Jet Hands, you can fly through the sky.

- And more …

Inspired by classic platforming games like the Super Mario series, we wanted to distill what made the genre so great and bring these concepts back in a brand new way. With this in mind we were able to bring a new level of skill, challenge, and discovery to VR. So you can come back again and again in the pursuit of bettering your skills and master the game.



- Easy to Pick Up - Controls are easy to use and do not require many buttons or gestures. New or hardcore gamers can easily jump into TO THE TOP.

- Hard to Master - To earn the best times and collect all of the items. You need to master all of the movement mechanics to pounce though the levels like a robotic cheetah.

- Learn the Environment - Each level can be traversed not only horizontally but vertically as well. It is important to learn these layouts and figure out the best paths through the levels.

- Challenging Obstacles - Each new level brings a new challenging obstacle to overcome ranging from Wall Runs to a giant moving robot you need to climb.

- Hidden Areas - Discover hidden paths in each level to earn a Medal.

https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/509250/extras/Hours_Of_Content.png?t=1531214921

These are often fairly casual affairs at churches, schools, libraries, etc, which allows you to talk to the musicians. Obviously you probably won't be successful just asking them to play your stuff but this becomes a way to establish a relationship which might prove fruitful.

And then obviously there's the internet. I'm not horribly aggressive but I've managed over the years to form a number of really important relationships with people all over the world that has helped me along. It's all about being a sincere part of as many communities as you can manage and then forming relationships with those people. 

Both of these approaches can be slow but that's the nature of networking outside of the Academy.

The other issue to consider is what exactly are you trying to ""sell""? If ""my music"" is the answer then you've probably already lost. There are so many composers working in so many similar genres/styles that relying just on your music pretty much insures you'll never stand out.

Instead you most likely need to sell yourself. What is it about you that is interesting or compelling. And how does that relate to your music? You need to think like a marketer and create a package that will interest people. If you have a story to tell about your life don't be afraid to use it. People build connections with *people* moreso than with the music people produce. How do all those indie bands succeed? Yes they have the music but they also work very hard to connect personally with their fans.

Now if you do happen to have some kind of unique music project you're working on then this might also help with the marketing aspect of things but those types of things tend to be rare.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/45c421b0f5c42a5c8cac80ac4ff148b9.png)  

&gt; The time is now for one of the industry’s best-kept secrets: PJ Morton. The Maroon 5 keyboardist/ backing vocalist makes his major label debut on May 14 with New Orleans, his first album for Young Money Entertainment/Cash Money Records. One listen to Morton’s anticipated project quickly reveals why the multi-talent became a favorite on the indie R&amp;B circuit and an in-demand songwriter/producer and also why the limitless talent will be a game changer for the Lil Wayne-founded Young Money.

&gt; New Orleans marks the Cash Money imprint’s first step toward broadening its already wide appeal, thanks to a hit-making and award-winning roster that includes founder Lil Wayne, Drake and Nicki Minaj. And there’s no better ambassador to musically personify that message than Morton, whose self described “soulful pop” seamlessly spans multiple genres from gospel and R&amp;B/funk to pop and rock.

&gt; “I’ve always pushed boundaries,” says Morton, “but I always remain true to who I am musically. New Orleans is a natural progression of who I am. I can’t explain it except through my music. That proves it better than anything I can say.”

&gt; Building that case is “Only One” featuring Stevie Wonder. Quickly garnering strong reaction following its January premiere on Billboard.com, the song is the lead single from New Orleans. Armed with an infectious hook and a head-boppin’ groove, the up-tempo number showcases Morton’s velvety tenor, songwriting skills and musicianship, accented by Wonder’s distinctive harmonica.

&gt; “Stevie joining me on the track is the ultimate start. It’s my dream come true,” says Morton of teaming with Wonder. “I want to continue the legacy he represents: musicianship and positivity.”

&gt; New Orleans itself stems from Morton’s acclaimed 2012 EP, Following My First Mind, featuring guest cameos from Maroon 5’s Adam Levine, Lil Wayne and Jazmine Sullivan. A nod to Morton’s hometown and musical roots, the forthcoming New Orleans finds Morton at the keyboard playing with a full backing band complete with horns and strings. The result is a lush, melodic yet organic 10-track set that grabs listeners right from the opening title track.

&gt; “New Orleans is where I learned how to play music,” recalls Morton. “It’s the physical and mind space I was in when I fell in love with music. It wasn’t about marketing, radio and publicity. It was just about making music because I loved it. It made me feel good. Young Money wanted me creatively as I am. That’s why I’m excited about this next chapter.”

&gt; Also featuring rapper Busta Rhymes, New Orleans comes packed with a diverse slate of musical influences. There’s the reggae-infused “Hard Enough,” which explores relationship issues. “I’m looking for a love unconditional / Not one that goes wherever the wind blows,” declares Morton as the song opens.

&gt; The self-described “Dr. Love” traverses the same landscape on the mid-tempo “Work It Out.” Set off by a touch of synth and a hypnotic drumbeat, the song once again spotlights Morton’s tantalizing tenor. Also noteworthy is “Heavy,” a song revamped from Morton’s 2012 EP and featuring Adam Levine. Sporting a funk/rock track reminiscent of Sly Stone and Prince, the song’s lyrics were inspired by Morton’s frustration at one point with his indie career.

&gt; “It was at a point where I was trying to figure out what the next step was,” says Morton, who hadn’t yet connected with pop hitmakers Maroon 5. “This was me getting those feelings out. Since that frustration, I’ve had one of the biggest years in my career. It’s crazy.”

&gt; Influenced by acts ranging from the Beatles and James Taylor to Wonder and Donny Hathaway, the New Orleans native is the son of gospel singer Paul S. Morton. His formal foray into the industry was as a member of the band Freestyle Nation, which debuted in the early 2000s. But it was as a songwriter/ producer that Morton left his first indelible impression. He won a Grammy Award for his songwriting/ production of India.Arie’s “Interested” from her 2002 album Voyage to India.

&gt; That opened the door to more collaborations (Jermaine Dupri, LL Cool J, Monica, Musiq Soulchild, Trinitee 5:7) and additional accolades (Dove and Stellar Awards) for his work with gospel singer DeWayne Woods. Woods’ “Let Go, Let God” spent a record 70 weeks on the gospel chart. Along the way, Morton released several acclaimed indie solo albums. He also attracted the attention of Academy Award-winning producer AR Rahman (“Slumdog Millionaire”), who asked Morton to contribute a song (“Sajna”) to the soundtrack for the Vince Vaughn comedy “Couples Retreat.”

&gt; Morton’s next big break occurred three years ago, when he was asked to audition by friend and Maroon
5 music director Adam Blackstone for a spot in the band as its keyboardist/vocalist. Soon after, childhood friend and Young Money Entertainment president Mack Maine championed Morton’s music and vision to Cash Money co-CEO’s Roland “Slim” Williams and Bryan “Birdman” Williams. With Lil Wayne co-signing his approval as well, Morton is ready to bring his journey full circle with New Orleans.

&gt; “My indie years and working with various artists, including Maroon 5, have helped me understand who I am as both an individual and an artist,” says Morton. “It has allowed me to create a fan base that will forever be with me. Now I’m being given the opportunity to do on steroids what I’ve been doing for years.” Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; The Academy Is... was a rock band which formed in 2003 in Chicago, Illinois, United States. The band's longest lasting lineup consisted of William Beckett (vocals, guitar), Mike Carden (guitar, vocals), Michael Chislett (guitar, keyboards), Adam Siska (bass) and Andy Mrotek (drums). The band released three albums - ""Almost Here"" (2005), ""Santi"" (2007) and ""Fast Times at Barrington High"" (2008) - before disbanding in 2011, several months after Chislett and Mrotek left the band.

&gt; William Beckett (singer) and Adam T. Siska's (bass) plans for starting a band together came to fruition on March 4, 2003 recruiting Mike Carden (guitar) after his former band, Jodie, which had members of Victory Records act June, broke up then eventually adding AJ LaTrace as a lead guitarist and Michael DelPrincipe (Little Mike) as a drummer. They recorded their self-titled debut EP, The Academy (2004), for the Chicago-based label LLR Recordings. LLR Recordings had previously released Beckett's solo project Remember Maine's debut album The Last Place You Look in 2002 and Mike Carden's solo folk album in 2003. The EP was recorded in Villa Park, IL at The Gallery of Carpet by producer Brian Zieske. Pete Wentz from Fall Out Boy heard it and was impressed. The label Fueled by Ramen immediately signed the band.

&gt; In 2004 the band headed to Florida to record their Fueled by Ramen debut Almost Here, produced by James Paul Wisner, who has worked with Dashboard Confessional, Something Corporate, Further Seems Forever, and Underoath. After recording the album and a doing a summer tour, the band underwent a lineup change. Thomas Conrad, formerly of Chicago local band 5o4plan, replaced LaTrace as the second guitarist/backing vocalist and Andy Mrotek, formerly of Last Place Champs, replaced DelPrincipe as the drummer. Andy Mrotek and Thomas Conrad are listed in the liner notes, but were added to the band after the recording of Almost Here to replace DelPrincipe and LaTrace, respectively. They hit the road hard, touring with Fall Out Boy, Something Corporate, Midtown, Matchbook Romance, Motion City Soundtrack and Armor for Sleep. The album was released on February 8, 2005 and the following summer, the band embarked on their first headlining tour alongside Plain White T's, Days Away and June. On Billboard's charts Almost Here peaked at #7 on Top Heatseekers, #16 on Independent Albums, and #185 on The Billboard 200.

&gt; On October 26, 2006, The Academy Is... had announced via the blog on their official website that Thomas Conrad and the band had parted ways. Michael Guy Chislett joined the band to replace Conrad on guitar.

&gt; While touring as a main act on the 2006 Warped Tour, the band began the process of writing songs for their second album. Once finished, the band flew to Los Angeles to record their record with Butch Walker. As of December 23, 2006, the band had officially finished the recording process and the album, entitled Santi, was released April 3, 2007 on the Fueled By Ramen label. The release of this album was listed on Blender's 25 reasons to love 2007. On January 26, 2007 a sample of ""LAX to O'Hare"" was released on the band's AbsolutePunk profile. The album peaked at #32 on the Billboard 200.

&gt; The band went on to release the song ""We've Got a Big Mess on Our Hands"" as the album's first single, before releasing the album on April 3, 2007. Fall Out Boy, +44, Cobra Starship, and Paul Wall all joined the band on the 2007 Honda Civic Tour, after which the band moved on to the ""Sleeping With Giants"" tour with support from The Rocket Summer, Armor for Sleep and Sherwood. Partly through the tour, Cobra Starship was added to the support. The tour ended on November 24, 2007 in Chicago.

&gt; The band's third studio album, Fast Times at Barrington High, was released on August 19, 2008 through Fueled by Ramen. The title refers to the high school William Beckett, Adam Siska, and videographer Jack Edinger attended. The first single, ""About a Girl,"" was added to the band's MySpace page on July 15, 2008 and was subsequently made available from various download sites. The lead model in the official music video for ""About a Girl"", Brittany Moser, also went to Barrington the same time Adam and William were in high school. On August 25, 2008 ""About a Girl"" was played on The Hills (season 4, episode 2). They also released the songs ""Summer Hair = Forever Young"" and ""His Girl Friday"" of FTABH on their MySpace page and PureVolume page. The album made it onto Rolling Stone Magazine's 50 Best Albums of the Year ranked as #46. It peaked at #17 on The Billboard 200

&gt; On William Beckett's Twitter page, it was said The Academy Is... have finished recording their new EP, Lost in Pacific Time: The AP/EP. It was released on September 22, 2009 on iTunes, and will be sold on the AP Fall Ball Tour. A limited number will also be sold on their webstore The track ""I'm Yours Tonight"" has already been released, and is on the band's Myspace page. Another track, ""Days Like Masquerades"" was played at an anti-suicide benefit at Barrington High School, in Barrington, Illinois. William has also been posting or linking lyrics on his blog. The newest song, ""Sputter"" (featuring Jack's Mannequin singer Andrew McMahon), is streaming on Banana's Music club, linked by both William and Pete Wentz via Twitter on September 21.[citation needed] On September 29, 2009, Pete Wentz announced via Twitter that TAI would replace The All-American Rejects for the St. Louis date of the Blink-182 tour, due to an injury to the AAR lead singer Tyson Ritter.

&gt; On May 26, the band announced that they will be supporting Kiss on their upcoming summer tour. The band also said that this tour will not affect the release date or direction of their new record.

&gt; On the tour with Kiss, they have been playing a cover of Sweet's ""Fox on the Run"", of which they contributed a recorded version to the soundtrack of the movie When In Rome. It is unclear though, whether the song will appear on the band's upcoming studio album.

&gt; On March 23, 2011, William Beckett tweeted that the band is currently making demos for the upcoming album.

&gt; On May 24, 2011, The Academy Is... made an announcement on their official website that said that fellow bandmates, Andy Mrotek &amp; Michael Guy Chislett, were leaving the band to pursue their own musical careers. There has reportedly been no hard feelings during this decision. William Beckett also stated that the three remaining members would be entering the studio soon to record their fourth full-length album. This announcement featured a minute-and-a-half snippet of a track called ""Chicago"". Whether or not Mrotek and Chislett collaborated on the track is unknown.

&gt; On May 26, 2011, William Beckett tweeted that they had entered and recorded in the studio.

&gt; On October 8, 2011, The Academy Is... announced their disbanding on their official Facebook page, stating that they had ""decided to go [their] separate ways."" Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; A Hamilton, Ontario-based electronic pop group, Junior Boys began as a duo with its duties split between Jeremy Greenspan and Johnny Dark. Influenced by a number of music sectors — including arty synthpop, minimal techno, uk garage, and contemporary hip-hop — they made a demo with no positive results. Dark opted to leave the group, but former Warp employee Nick Kilroy eventually heard the songs and became interested enough to begin his KIN label with Junior Boys as its first artist. Engineer Matt Didemus joined Greenspan, and together they recorded enough material for a full-length. Prior to the 2004 release of the resulting album, titled Last Exit, a pair of 12"" singles were released — one included a remix from Fennesz, while the other featured a remix from Manitoba (now Caribou).

&gt; Three months after Last Exit's initial U.K. release, Domino picked up the album for distribution in the U.S. The Domino version added a bonus disc with B-sides and remixes from the 12"" releases. The relatively slick So This Is Goodbye followed in 2006. The single ""In The Morning"" was featured in an iTunes commercial in 2007.

&gt; On July 10, 2007, Junior Boys second album was revealed as being on the shortlist for the 2007 Polaris Music Prize. They did not ultimately win the prize.

&gt; In September 2008, Morgan Geist's album ""Double Night Time"" was released with five songs performed by Jeremy Greenspan.

&gt; On April 7, 2009, the duo released their third full length album, Begone Dull Care on Domino records. The album is named for a short film by Academy Award-winning National Film Board animator Norman McLaren. The front cover gives the band name in French, along with Caprice en Couleurs, the French title of the film; the entirety of the liner notes is presented bilingually, including song titles.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/9ace6db96e75f2d4ec2e7b2cabadcd7f.png)  

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

&gt; Janelle Monáe (born Janelle Monáe Robinson on December 1, 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and performer.

&gt;  She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

&gt; A Fine Frenzy is a band led by Alison Sudol (born December 23, 1984 in Seattle, Washington), an American singer, songwriter and pianist. They released their first studio album One Cell In The Sea on July 17, 2007.

&gt; Born in Seattle to dramatic-arts teacher parents, Alison moved to Los Angeles, US at the age of five. With her newly single mother, Alison moved frequently around the city. She developed a strong love for the fantastic literary worlds of CS Lewis, EB White, Lewis Carroll and Charles Dickens, while becoming a passionate author in her own right.

&gt; In an interview with www.spinner.com Alison Sudol shares how she came up with the band's name ""(I) had a bunch of books open on a table, ""a fine frenzy"" jumped off a page of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' [Shakespeare] and it was just right, though every now and then I wonder if it's a bit ... flowery.""

&gt; Alison also immersed herself in classical music, Motown, Aretha Franklin, swing bands, Ella Fitzgerald, Elton John, Louis Armstrong, the Beatles, Technicolor movies and classic 1950's television.

&gt; After teaching herself to play piano, Alison increasingly invested her internal narratives into song form. She found solace in the melodic melancholia of new global British bands Aqualung, Radiohead, Coldplay, Keane, etc... She was also moved by the diatonic minimalism of Philip Glass and the transportive allure of Icelandic music (Björk, Sigur Rós). She graduated from Delphi Academy Los Angeles in 2001. Inspired, Alison Sudol developed the sound of A Fine Frenzy - hypnotic piano arrangements under classic American melody fused into irresistible, atmospheric songs with the power to reach around the world.

I think The Academy is ""biased"" towards blockbusters in general, it's not a Marvel thing, or a DC thing, or anything like that. Like, the fact that The Dark Knight wasn't nominated for an Oscar shows that. And, it is true, we are seeing change, but not THAT amount of change. 

If you ask me, among the 2018 Marvel movies, Black Panther would have a better chance to be nominated for Best Picture, but not VFX imo. Just because it was a relevant movie from a social pov for the U.S. audience, so maybe they would wanna recognise it in the same way they did with Get Out a year ago. I think it's stands better chances than IW for these reasons, also being an almost standalone film. Sequels are rarely nominated, only Lord of the rings 2 and 3, The Godfather 2 and 3, were nominated AFTER the 1st one also being nominated. Mad Max: Fury Road was nominated, but that's more of a reboot than a sequel, and a ""big comeback"", kind of the same thing with Toy Story 3, celebrating the comeback of a franchise, I cannot think of any other, but I don't see a movie so dependant of a cinematic universe getting Academy love. 

Also, as a big film buff I tell you, this is going to be a tough year for ANY ""big movie"". ""A quiet place"" or ""Hereditary"" could be the surprise to break the mold, bringing again some horror into the selection, but those are also indie, the competition for one of those 8-9 places will be fierce with the line ups with have for the last third of the year. 

If I am being realistic, to me the answer is a... hell no (at least on important categories such as best picture, script, acting, etc...)

&gt; Mission of Burma is an American post-punk band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1979. The band was formed by Roger Miller (guitar), Clint Conley (bass), Peter Prescott (drums) and Martin Swope (tape manipulator/sound engineer). Miller, Conley and Prescott share singing and songwriting duties. Like many of their post-punk contemporaries, Mission of Burma's efforts are largely concerned with extending punk's original vocabulary without losing its essential rebellious spirit. Using rapid shifts in dynamics, unconventional time signatures and chord progressions along with tape effects, Mission of Burma challenges the prevailing idioms of punk while attempting to retain its power and immediacy.

&gt; In early years the band's audience was limited to the Boston area, with all their recordings released on the small Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. The band released only one album in its original form, Vs.. Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope, and has since recorded two more albums, ONoffON and The Obliterati.

&gt; Their wall-of-noise musical sound extended the vocabulary of punk while continuing to hold clear its sense of power and abandon.  They used a number of tape effects, different chord progressions, and time shifts to highlight their formal training in music.  Not only that but they are seen now as a highly influential band to both post-punk and experimental music to come after; many bands cite Burma as an inspiration, including Nirvana, Superchunk, Creed, The Grifters, R.E.M. (who regularly covered ""Academy Fight Song"" on their Green tour), Sonic Youth, Throwing Muses, Yo La Tengo, Soul Asylum, Pixies, Sugar, Catherine Wheel, Guided by Voices, Graham Coxon and Moby - the last two of which have covered """"That's When I Reach For My Revolver.""

&gt; The band were due to tour in 1980 with Joy Division but the suicide of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's singer, canceled the tour. In 1983, after releasing their only full-length studio record Vs., the group disbanded due to Miller's worsening tinnitus.

&gt; The band found increasing relevance throughout the 90s, culminating in the publication of Michael Azzerad's essays Our Band Could Be Your Life which featured Mission of Burma. In 2002, they reunited and began playing reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and formerly Prescott's Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller relates that ""when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin's position, we told him he could use current digital technology which accomplishes Martin's antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted for maintaining the original integrity, and uses a tape deck.""

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/7d40fdce4c370f59fe906c5568fa5a57.png)  

&gt; Life began for Kamasi Washington on February 18, 1981 in Los Angeles, California. In the Washington family music was more of a prerequisite than a privilege. But Kamasi never saw it that way, his love for music began at first sound. His father, Rickey Washington is a professional saxophonist by night and a high school music teacher by day. Kamasi’s mother, Valerie Washington is an accomplished flutist who fell in love with the world of science and became a high school chemistry teacher after her stint as a genetic researcher. By the age of two Kamasi had already began to play the drums and piano, the only thing that kept him away from the wind instruments at that early age was his lack of dental development. He began his exploration into the world of the reeds and brass when he was about seven and his father gave him a clarinet. By the age of twelve Kamasi had found his voice in the form of a tenor saxophone, in fact it was the same saxophone that his father played in high school. 

&gt; Over the next year Kamasi’s development and devotion to music had out grown his academic environment. So he transferred from The Los Angeles Center of Enriched Studies (one the top academic high schools in the nation) and enrolled into the Hamilton High School Music Academy. It was around this time that Kamasi also joined The Multi School Jazz Band (M.S.J.B.), an assembly of the finest young jazz musicians in Los Angeles County and led by Reginald Andrews the same man that taught Kamasi’s father in high school. Because of the sheer vastness of talent that he was surrounded by it was in The Multi School Jazz Band that Kamasi was most inspired during his high school years. Through M.S.J.B. Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi’s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as “The Young Jazz Giants”. 
This fiery group of “Young Giants” wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year “The Young Jazz Giants” had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. 

&gt; After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson’s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album “In My Time” which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi’s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called “Bird Man Records” heard him playing with “The Young Jazz Giants” and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the “big break” for “The Young Jazz Giants” but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after its completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay “ready and waiting” for too long, thus “The Young Jazz Giants” unofficially disbanded. 

&gt; Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called “The Next Step” and that’s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking. 

&gt; (2) Kamasi Washington didn't pick up a saxophone until he was 13 years old, but by that point, he'd been playing several other instruments. That's when he found his calling. Within a couple years, he was the lead tenor saxophonist at Hamilton High School Music Academy in his native Los Angeles. After graduation, he attended UCLA to study ethnomusicology. While enrolled at UCLA, he recorded a self-titled album with Young Jazz Giants, a quartet he had formed with Cameron Graves and brothers Ronald Bruner, Jr. and Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner, released in 2004. From that point, Washington continually performed and recorded with an impressive variety of major artists across several genres, including Snoop Dogg, Raphael Saadiq, Gerald Wilson, McCoy Tyner, George Duke, and PJ Morton. In 2014 alone, Washington demonstrated tremendous range with appearances on Broken Bells' After the Disco, Harvey Mason's Chameleon, Stanley Clarke's Up, and Flying Lotus' You're Dead!, among other albums that covered indie rock, contemporary and progressive jazz, and experimental electronic music. 

&gt;  The following year, Washington contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly and finally debuted as a leader with The Epic, released on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label. An expansive triple album nearly three hours in duration, it involved the other three-quarters of Young Jazz Giants -- by then part of his larger ten piece collective, altnerately known as The Next Step and West Coast Get Down-- string orchestra and choir conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. 

&gt;  The Epic was a critical and commerial success. Not only did it land at number three on the jazz charts, it also found its way on to independent albums and heatseekers charts as well. Washington and his band were not only able to tour the U.S., but to play in Europe and Japan as well. ~ Andy Kellman

I feel like she can be a solo artist after that time. Definitely after improving her already pretty good vocals. She can either go into the SK scene or the Jpn scene. I don't think she'll fit into the typical pop scene of either countries. R&amp;B/Hiphop, indie, and rock are some pretty big genres outside of pop from either country that Miyu could fit. SK's hiphop and R&amp;b scene is home to Crush, Dean, Zion T, Hoodie, Gsoul, Jay Park, Suran, etc. The international reach of SK's music is a big plus with this genre as well. Dean has collabed with Syd. You can also compose music with great acts in the west more commonly. Daniel Caesar worked on a Loona song, although that is K-pop. SK indie acts can make it pretty big as well. Bb4 even beat bts in music shows. I don't know how well indie does in Japan. Japan has the internationally famous Jrock. Miyu can play many instruments that a rock band uses. She could also go the main vocalist route. I think she would fit more in the indie or r&amp;b scenes, though. If she doesn't make it into the final group, I would still recommend working on those vocals professionally. There is an excellent Korean vocalist named So Hyang who has a vocal academy. If you've never seen any of her singing, I seriously recommend it. She's dubbed as the Korean Mariah Carey for a reason. Miyu could work on her support and stuff there. After that, she can seriously go into the r&amp;b or indie scenes in SK or go to Jpn to be a jpop artist. More on the Jpn side, I would love to see her collab with Utada Hikaru some day and pro vocal lessons in Jpn would be great as well so she can jump into the jpop artist scene.",,,,,,False,[],False,,,,,False,,True,t3_8z2xjt,,,False,/r/Produce48/comments/8z2xjt/japanese_trainee_discussion_180716/e2ghm23/,public,,,,,,1531703608.0,r/Produce48,0,,,,,,1530320116.0,,,1536103871.0,,,

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/9ace6db96e75f2d4ec2e7b2cabadcd7f.png)  

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

&gt; Janelle Monáe (born Janelle Monáe Robinson on December 1, 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and performer.

&gt;  She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

&gt; Floater began in 1993 when Robert Wynia (lead vocals, bass), Peter Cornett (drums), and Dave Amador (guitar), got together in Eugene, Oregon, making their start at garage parties and the U of O beer garden. With compelling lyrics and adept storytelling, their music shifts in mood from the insistent and heavy to the melodic and soulful, comprising the signature sound for which Floater is best known.

&gt; Floater's regional success was noticed by Elemental Records, who put out their first full-length record, ""Sink"" in 1994. That same year Floater began a string of sold out shows at the Community Center for the Performing Arts (The WOW Hall) that is still unbroken to this day.

&gt; In 1995 Floater released ""Glyph"" and toured the country for the next two years supporting the record. The single, ""Danny Boy"" received heavy college and commercial radio play, in many cities outselling major label releases. Floater received nominations to the preliminary level of the Grammy's from NARAS (National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences) in 1995 under Best Rock Performance for ""Sink"" and in 1996 under Best Alternative Performance for ""Glyph."" (Prelims are determined by nominations from the NARAS members).

&gt; In 1998, following their move to Portland, Oregon (where the band currently resides), Floater released their third full-length record, ""Angels in the Flesh and Devils in the Bone."" The second concept album by the band (""Sink"" was the first), ""Angel's"" brought a new vibe to Floater. It wasn't long before widespread audiences came to embrace what has now become the band's trademark - their versatility. 

&gt; September of 2000 brought the release of Floater's fourth full- length record, ""Burning Sosobra""; a musical collection that explores the band's broad range of song writing. Following its release, the band began to perform live acoustically. Both the band and the fans enjoyed this new avenue of performance that allowed the ""quieter"" side of Floater to emerge and be explored. Of late, the band has begun playing shows where acoustic Floater opens for electric Floater - giving a sort of Jekyll and Hyde feel to their performances.

&gt; In 2002 Floater released their most critically acclaimed record to date, ""Alter."" Combining the bands strongest musical elements, ""Alter"" moves fluidly from heavy riffs to lullabies and tells flowing stories of fear, love and above all change.

&gt; August of 2004 - The release of the band's acoustic record, ""Acoustics."" Fans of Floater's electric shows responded with enthusiasm to the band's occasional acoustic performance - with their record label's encouragement, the band put together a uniquely recorded album - one that mimics the sound of their actual performances. Recorded in a studio built in the ballroom of their producers house, the record was made without digital editing and has a fresh, live feeling. 

&gt; Floater is also the name of a late nineties indiepop band from Sheffield, UK. They briefly rename themselves Floater UK before later reforming as Dangerlust. Read more on Last.fm.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/8e1c95f7e026154312ba09ca3ea55e6d.png)  

&gt; Life began for Kamasi Washington on February 18, 1981 in Los Angeles, California. In the Washington family music was more of a prerequisite than a privilege. But Kamasi never saw it that way, his love for music began at first sound. His father, Rickey Washington is a professional saxophonist by night and a high school music teacher by day. Kamasi’s mother, Valerie Washington is an accomplished flutist who fell in love with the world of science and became a high school chemistry teacher after her stint as a genetic researcher. By the age of two Kamasi had already began to play the drums and piano, the only thing that kept him away from the wind instruments at that early age was his lack of dental development. He began his exploration into the world of the reeds and brass when he was about seven and his father gave him a clarinet. By the age of twelve Kamasi had found his voice in the form of a tenor saxophone, in fact it was the same saxophone that his father played in high school. 

&gt; Over the next year Kamasi’s development and devotion to music had out grown his academic environment. So he transferred from The Los Angeles Center of Enriched Studies (one the top academic high schools in the nation) and enrolled into the Hamilton High School Music Academy. It was around this time that Kamasi also joined The Multi School Jazz Band (M.S.J.B.), an assembly of the finest young jazz musicians in Los Angeles County and led by Reginald Andrews the same man that taught Kamasi’s father in high school. Because of the sheer vastness of talent that he was surrounded by it was in The Multi School Jazz Band that Kamasi was most inspired during his high school years. Through M.S.J.B. Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi’s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as “The Young Jazz Giants”. 
This fiery group of “Young Giants” wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year “The Young Jazz Giants” had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. 

&gt; After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson’s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album “In My Time” which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi’s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called “Bird Man Records” heard him playing with “The Young Jazz Giants” and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the “big break” for “The Young Jazz Giants” but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after its completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay “ready and waiting” for too long, thus “The Young Jazz Giants” unofficially disbanded. 

&gt; Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called “The Next Step” and that’s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking. 

&gt; (2) Kamasi Washington didn't pick up a saxophone until he was 13 years old, but by that point, he'd been playing several other instruments. That's when he found his calling. Within a couple years, he was the lead tenor saxophonist at Hamilton High School Music Academy in his native Los Angeles. After graduation, he attended UCLA to study ethnomusicology. While enrolled at UCLA, he recorded a self-titled album with Young Jazz Giants, a quartet he had formed with Cameron Graves and brothers Ronald Bruner, Jr. and Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner, released in 2004. From that point, Washington continually performed and recorded with an impressive variety of major artists across several genres, including Snoop Dogg, Raphael Saadiq, Gerald Wilson, McCoy Tyner, George Duke, and PJ Morton. In 2014 alone, Washington demonstrated tremendous range with appearances on Broken Bells' After the Disco, Harvey Mason's Chameleon, Stanley Clarke's Up, and Flying Lotus' You're Dead!, among other albums that covered indie rock, contemporary and progressive jazz, and experimental electronic music. 

&gt;  The following year, Washington contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly and finally debuted as a leader with The Epic, released on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label. An expansive triple album nearly three hours in duration, it involved the other three-quarters of Young Jazz Giants -- by then part of his larger ten piece collective, altnerately known as The Next Step and West Coast Get Down-- string orchestra and choir conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. 

&gt;  The Epic was a critical and commerial success. Not only did it land at number three on the jazz charts, it also found its way on to independent albums and heatseekers charts as well. Washington and his band were not only able to tour the U.S., but to play in Europe and Japan as well. ~ Andy Kellman

&gt; Poi Dog Pondering is an American musical group, noted for its cross-pollination of diverse musical genres, including various forms of acoustic folk music, and electronic music. Founded in Hawaii in 1985 around the creative vision of lead singer-songwriter Frank Orrall, the band moved to Austin, Texas in 1987, where they recorded their first three albums. In 1992, the band (with ever-evolving membership) relocated once again, this time to Chicago, Illinois, and began to incorporate elements of house music into their style.

&gt; Orrall took the band's pop folk direction into electronic &amp; ambient house music in the later 1990's ,but has since returned to explore the soft rock, folk, country &amp; soul influences that gave the band it's initial audience on the indie Texas Hotel imprint and eventual major label contract with Columbia/Sony in the late 1980's.

&gt; Poi Dog Pondering ""the little big band with the strong back and supple/stubborn heart"" has been following its intuition for 20 years.  From bohemian street buskers to impossible-to-market major label sacrificial lambs, PdP have ripened into  staunchly independent musical voyagers.  Every sound that has excited them flows through their music and floods it with ever changing colors - acoustic, folk, global music, big band disco, electronic textures, orchestral collaborations, ROCK and SOUL - threaded with lyrics that embrace both the beauty and pain that life can bring.

&gt; Poi dog Pondering formed in Hawaii in 1986.  The first live performance was at the Honolulu Arts Academy.  Filled with youthful exuberance and inspiration from ready about Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground's  ""Exploding Plastic Inevitable"" projected film and music happening, PdP projected films of lava eruptions, ocean and other natural environments over the band as they performed.  The tradition of projected imagery along with PdP live performances has developed and matured over the years and continues.

&gt; There is a bolstered sense of history within the band now, a swagger that comes from having steadfastly carved their own path.  It is quite apparent that PdP has always been, and ever will be in it for the love of it; creating and performing.  Line up changes are par for the course.  PdP is an organic entity, it changes like life does.  But there is a core with strong roots, open to new eras and ready to experiment.  That's what keeps it vibrant.

&gt; Band leader, Frank Orrall's interest in electronic music garnered him respect from the Chicago House/Electronic music community for his solo project 8fatfat8, and lead him to become a member of Thievery Corporation as percussionist and vocalist.  All this influenced 2 of PDP’s Natural Thing and In Seed Comes Fruit albums which saw the band experimenting with electronic textures, beautiful lush arrangements and un-hurried, sometimes instrumental song structures, letting musicality determine the song structure, rather than traditional ""verse / chorus / bridge"" style song writing.

&gt; 
Poi dog Pondering delivered a Rock and Soul record with "" 7 "",their 7th studio album, 14 cuts deep and layered in horns, strings, immediate guitars; sometimes shimmering and liquid, &amp; sometimes ""crunch and gristle"".  A painter's  pallete of unique instruments, vintage keyboards, ""on the sleeve"" lyrics, gripping bass &amp; drums and beautiful harmonies.  Known for following their heart, this record finds PdP playful, intimate, honest, cocky, boisterous and definitely ready to take it live.

&gt; 

&gt; “Poi is becoming one of the longest running and most spirited do-it-yourself musical institutions in the country, defying the odds of commerce and interpersonal relationships by keeping a 12 piece band viable…” – GREG KOT, CHICAGO TRIBUNE

&gt; “The Poi Dog sound happens because of the real and deep connection between the
players, which shows in how they listen to one another in performance. The fact that most of them have been doing just that for two decades only increases the power of community they bring to the stage.” - NO DEPRESSION (January 2008, Live Review) Read more on Last.fm.

Label: Bella Union 

Format: Vinyl, LP, Album, Limited Edition, Gold UK pressing

Danish ethereal indie rock comes from Lowly.  Some phenomenal musicianship and singing.  A little bit in the Cocteau Twins realm, but it goes way outside and modernizes that sound with dreamy and mysterious songs.  Their technical skill (they met studying music at the Royal Academy of Music in Aarhus, Denmark blends into some really compelling songcraft.  There’s a lot of ideas in each song.  Prepare the Lake and Word are essential tracks, and the album seemed to gain steam as it went along.  I felt Side B was even better than the first.    You can’t go wrong with music from Scandinavia, seems like anything I listen to from Denmark, Sweden, or places in between is stellar and this is no different.

I really dig Bella Union, one of my preferred labels.  Don’t know if was intentional, but the jacket doesn’t list a track 8.  Pommerate is a second track 7 after #7 Stubborn Day.

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles.

&gt; Lia Ices is the stage name of Lia Kessel, a singer-songwriter from Westport, Connecticut, currently living in the Hudson Valley, New York. While she has been performing and recording for several years, Ices gained prominence when her song ""Love Is Won"", from her second studio album Grown Unknown, was played over the closing credits of the second-to-last episode of season one of HBO's Girls on June 10, 2012.

&gt; Her mother is a photographer and book binder, and Kessel says that her father has been a source of musical inspiration throughout her life, encouraging her to write her own songs from an early age. She began playing the piano at age 5, studied theatre at the preparatory high school Walnut Hill School for the Arts and went on to explore the worlds of dance and theater at the Experimental Theatre Wing of New York University's Tisch School of the Arts and by studying Shakespeare at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. Kessel's brother, Eliot, is also a musician, and a collaborator in her music.

&gt; In 2005 she began performing publicly under her birth name of Lia Kessel, performing at small venues in New York. Kessel did press an EP of songs independently, but these songs were never distributed commercially. During this time she worked with two backing bands, The Marina and Wild Cries. In late 2007 she participated in the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Baby Dee, called Safe Inside the Day, singing vocals on three tracks.

&gt; In 2008, she adopted the name Lia Ices, and her first full-length album, Necima, was released in September of that year, produced by Nicolas Vernhes at Rare Book Room Studios in Brooklyn, NY. The music webzine Pitchfork wrote of the album: ""When Ices and Vernhes find a creative symbiosis, usually on the record's shorter, pop-leaning tracks, the results are spectacular."" Critics compared her singing favorably to that of Kate Bush, and more contemporary artists like Feist and Bat For Lashes, as well as Tori Amos and Cat Power.

&gt; In early 2011, Ices released her sophomore album, Grown Unknown. Again it was mixed at the Rare Book Room Studios in Brooklyn but released through her new label, Jagjaguwar Records. She spent six months in Vermont writing most of the album, and recorded the album at the The Clubhouse in Rhinebeck, NY. The album's second track ""Daphne"" features a duet with Bon Iver frontman, Justin Vernon. Critics found her voice more relaxed than on her debut album.

&gt; On April 3, 2012, Jagjaguwar Records released a 7"" single of Ices covering Pink Floyd's ""Wish You Were Here"", taken from Mojo magazine's Pink Floyd October 2011 special edition. The B side was another cover, of Syd Barrett's ""Late Night"". Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; New LP, Broken Devotion, out now!

&gt; Free download of a new Mint Julep track 'Tame': https://soundcloud.com/keithkenniff/mint-julep-tame-free-download

&gt; Other projects by Keith Kenniff: Helios and Goldmund.

&gt; Formed in Boston, Massachusetts, in 2007, Mint Julep is the husband-and-wife team of Hollie and Keith Kenniff. Subsequently relocating to Portland, Oregon, the duo cut a limited release album, Songs About Snow, in 2008 – effectively a trial run for further recording in their home studio, the fruit of which is a sublime follow-up, Save Your Season, released in 2011. The duo self-released Broken Devotion on Unseen in 2015. An ambient album, A Deep and Dreamless Sleep, is slated for release in late 2016.

&gt; Hallmarked by Hollie’s seductive, dreamy vocals and a succession of memorably soaring choruses, all of it etched with Keith’s vivid, glinting keyboards, towering guitars and miscellaneous instrumental hooks, Mint Julep make lustrous modern pop music that is wistful and mellifluous yet simultaneously powerful, even epic – equal parts shoegazing romanticism and cool, Kraftwerkian polish. Their songs seem instantly familiar, like old musical friends, a ’classicism’ offset by the freshness and luminosity they exude as they usher you on a breathless ride through the sunlit uplands of electronic indie-rock.

&gt; Mint Julep was designed as a conscious departure from Keith’s previous, ambient- orientated projects. “When Hollie and I set out to do something, I wanted to find some way to incorporate her vocals into a slightly different style, rather than just write similar material to my solo work and lay her vocals over top”, he says. “I had the need to write something that had some distorted guitars, loud drums and was a little bolder than what I had previously done. We messed around with a track one night (which became ‘Stay’) and it was a fun process, so we just kept writing more songs so we could do a project together.”
Soon a working pattern emerged, with Keith composing music around Hollie’s lyrics or making tracks which Hollie would then add to. “It just developed after a lot of trial and error, and after a while the material started to plateau and began to sound like an album…”

&gt; A Pennsylvannian by birth, Keith Kenniff is an honours graduate of Boston’s esteemed Berklee College of Music, best known as the brains behind dulcet ambient/electronic practitioners Helios and the fingers on the ivories of post-classical piano minimalists Goldmund (the latter’s music once described by no less an authority than Ryuichi Sakamoto as “…so, so, so beautiful…”). A succession of albums under those aliases has made Kenniff the darling of discerning critics and his music has also been widely used in film, television and advertising, not least on the soundtrack to Harmony Korine’s 2007 comedy-drama Mister Lonely and the trailer for the 2009 Academy Award-nominated Revolutionary Road, directed by Sam Mendes.

&gt; Originally from Ohio, singer Hollie Kenniff maintains dual US/Canadian citizenship, having spent part of her life in Ontario. Aside from Mint Julep, she has collaborated on several additional musical endeavors in tandem with husband Keith, including a children’s music project, Meadows, (inspired by the couple’s young son), whose debut longplayer was recently released, and an ambient diversion under their own names.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/46549aac302f014f9c93db1cdb097376.png)  

&gt; Life began for Kamasi Washington on February 18, 1981 in Los Angeles, California. In the Washington family music was more of a prerequisite than a privilege. But Kamasi never saw it that way, his love for music began at first sound. His father, Rickey Washington is a professional saxophonist by night and a high school music teacher by day. Kamasi’s mother, Valerie Washington is an accomplished flutist who fell in love with the world of science and became a high school chemistry teacher after her stint as a genetic researcher. By the age of two Kamasi had already began to play the drums and piano, the only thing that kept him away from the wind instruments at that early age was his lack of dental development. He began his exploration into the world of the reeds and brass when he was about seven and his father gave him a clarinet. By the age of twelve Kamasi had found his voice in the form of a tenor saxophone, in fact it was the same saxophone that his father played in high school. 

&gt; Over the next year Kamasi’s development and devotion to music had out grown his academic environment. So he transferred from The Los Angeles Center of Enriched Studies (one the top academic high schools in the nation) and enrolled into the Hamilton High School Music Academy. It was around this time that Kamasi also joined The Multi School Jazz Band (M.S.J.B.), an assembly of the finest young jazz musicians in Los Angeles County and led by Reginald Andrews the same man that taught Kamasi’s father in high school. Because of the sheer vastness of talent that he was surrounded by it was in The Multi School Jazz Band that Kamasi was most inspired during his high school years. Through M.S.J.B. Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi’s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as “The Young Jazz Giants”. 
This fiery group of “Young Giants” wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year “The Young Jazz Giants” had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. 

&gt; After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson’s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album “In My Time” which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi’s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called “Bird Man Records” heard him playing with “The Young Jazz Giants” and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the “big break” for “The Young Jazz Giants” but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after its completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay “ready and waiting” for too long, thus “The Young Jazz Giants” unofficially disbanded. 

&gt; Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called “The Next Step” and that’s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking. 

&gt; (2) Kamasi Washington didn't pick up a saxophone until he was 13 years old, but by that point, he'd been playing several other instruments. That's when he found his calling. Within a couple years, he was the lead tenor saxophonist at Hamilton High School Music Academy in his native Los Angeles. After graduation, he attended UCLA to study ethnomusicology. While enrolled at UCLA, he recorded a self-titled album with Young Jazz Giants, a quartet he had formed with Cameron Graves and brothers Ronald Bruner, Jr. and Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner, released in 2004. From that point, Washington continually performed and recorded with an impressive variety of major artists across several genres, including Snoop Dogg, Raphael Saadiq, Gerald Wilson, McCoy Tyner, George Duke, and PJ Morton. In 2014 alone, Washington demonstrated tremendous range with appearances on Broken Bells' After the Disco, Harvey Mason's Chameleon, Stanley Clarke's Up, and Flying Lotus' You're Dead!, among other albums that covered indie rock, contemporary and progressive jazz, and experimental electronic music. 

&gt;  The following year, Washington contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly and finally debuted as a leader with The Epic, released on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label. An expansive triple album nearly three hours in duration, it involved the other three-quarters of Young Jazz Giants -- by then part of his larger ten piece collective, altnerately known as The Next Step and West Coast Get Down-- string orchestra and choir conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. 

&gt;  The Epic was a critical and commerial success. Not only did it land at number three on the jazz charts, it also found its way on to independent albums and heatseekers charts as well. Washington and his band were not only able to tour the U.S., but to play in Europe and Japan as well. ~ Andy Kellman

There are plenty of really good films from the USA and music from the Anglosphere and discriminating against them based on their origin would be just plain stupid. Everybody does want to see quality movies and listen to quality music.

That being said, it is absolutely not a fair competition based on movie/music quality, at all. The Anglosphere has incredible advantages in place:

* English is the de facto lingua franca so English language products can be consumed by a lot of people without additional investment

* The production is very much streamlined, that is, Hollywood for example has quality infrastructure in place as well as plenty of cast and crew living in close proximity *because* they were drawn there by the industry.

* Distrubution has the same level or even more streamlining. Getting a movie created by an established US studio into cinemas worldwide is incredibly easy, regardless of movie quality. There are plenty of crap movies screened in cinemas simply because they come from established studio which has the capacity to create bad movies, the contracts to deliver them to cinemas and the budget to market them. If you are an indie filmmaker you just simply cannot do that, even if your product is vastly superior.

* They have a brand, overpriced if you ask me. Cannes may be important for the industry but people are way more interested in the Academy Awards (Oscars). A ""Hollywood movie"" is a phenomenon. Nobody has even heard about awards given in Germany, Spain or Russa, nor would they care about where are their movies made. All these are free marketing (people are interested) which increases the brand value (if future demand is expected, it is evaluated more positively) which then allows larger marketing costs and better salaries to the participants which then again leads to more people dreaming about ""becoming a Hollywood star"" so more people go to Hollywood and it's easier to find qualified people for the movies - for less cost.

And the entire thing is just a huge feedback loop that feeds itself.

This incredibly distorted market is what's bothering me. In fair competition we would get quality movies from all around the globe but the rules of the game favour the Anglosphere (and mainly the USA) while Swedish, Moroccan or Chinese etc. movie and music creators have a huge disadvantage. And that sucks.

Honestly, have you seen just ONE movie from all 6 countries mentioned (Germany, Spain, Russia, Sweden, Morocco, China)?

&gt; Cass McCombs (born in Concord, California in 1977) is an American singer-songwriter and performer.

&gt; An enigmatic folk nomad, McCombs is a quintessentially American artist; ""he's quietly become one of (the country's) finest chroniclers of fringe characters, a writer of heart-rending love songs and psychedelic odes to the natural world, a teller of tall-tales with a sense of humor dry as desert wood, and that rare folksinger who actually sings about the folk."" His vocals range somewhere between the anxious drone of Lou Reed, the hollow croon of Elliott Smith, the lilting melody of Morrissey, and the driving earnestness and complexity of bards such as Leonard Cohen or Bob Dylan. His lyrical style is alternately vivid and weary, laconic and yearning, or drifting into the high-spirited and whimsical.

&gt; After cutting his first EP, Not the Way in San Francisco in 2001, McCombs relocated to Baltimore, MD. There he released ""Not the Way"" in 2002 and recorded his first full-length, A, in 2003 on Monitor Records. He spent the next few years touring: playing All Tomorrow's Parties; and opening for bands such as Modest Mouse, The Decemberists, and Belle and Sebastian; before recording his second LP PREfection, which was released on 4AD in 2005. 

&gt; McCombs' subsequent releases have been on the highly successful British independent label Domino Recording Co. 2007's Dropping the Writ was named one of Amazon's Best Albums of that year. Catacombs was voted one of the 50 greatest albums of 2009 by Pitchfork Media, and features Academy Award-nominated actress and singer Karen Black on the track Dreams-Come-True-Girl. During this period, McCombs toured with the likes of Arcade Fire, Andrew Bird, Band of Horses, José González, Beach House, and The Walkmen.

&gt; Catacombs also established McCombs' relationship with engineer/producer Ariel Rechtshaid, member of The Hippos and Foreign Born, who produced Grammy-winning hit Climax for Usher, the Plain White T's Grammy-nominated No.1 platinum-selling single Hey There Delilah, and albums for Vampire Weekend, Sky Ferreira, Snoop Lion, and Haim, among others.

&gt; In 2010 McCombs played Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago, L.A.'s Culture Collide Festival and Invisible Children Benefit. 2011 offered an extensive headlining tour, an appearance at SXSW, and two albums released by McCombs and produced by Rechtshaid: Wit's End in April and Humor Risk in November. The two albums were made simultaneously. In an interview with Pitchfork, McCombs explains: ""Wit's End was started years ago and it slowly made its way to the finish line. Humor Risk was just punched out. They're friends but they're different. Wit's End is like a stew; Humor Risk is the raw food diet.""

&gt; Big Wheel and Others, McCombs' seventh full-length (and first double album) was released in October 2013. The album is rooted in the Americana mythos of the Wild West, from the San Francisco drug culture to the gunslingers and gold rush of the nineteenth century. The album once again features Karen Black on a version of the track Brighter!, her final recording before passing away due to ampullary cancer in August, 2013. Big Wheel is dedicated to her memory.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/9ace6db96e75f2d4ec2e7b2cabadcd7f.png)  

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

And absolutely the smaller venues do tend to have a very mixed crowd but I like that. I've seen everyone from Roger Chapman to Slowdive at these O2 Academy venues and to be quite honest most of the people at these gigs are probably not students so you have a fair point there.

And yeah, in the social media smartphone age there is much less of an alternative underground. Irvine Welsh said in a recent interview that youth culture is dead and it's hard to argue with that. Once upon a time music was very tribal and you had to be only into a certain set of artists and not like totally different stuff - liking the ""wrong"" artist could set you apart from your peers as you will probably be aware! But then along came the hipsters in the noughties with their iPods and that all changed forever.

Now the younger millennial and post-millennial kids who are up and coming are just gonna see music as this huge confusing back catalogue of stuff on Spotify and will not so readily identify with the little tribes of eras past!",,,,,,,[],False,,,,,False,,True,t3_8p7pq1,,,False,/r/Aberdeen/comments/8p7pq1/how_do_we_fix_the_aberdeen_music_scene_thread_on/e0cu905/,public,,,,,,1528500940.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1532345825.0,,,markdown

The type of artists I like (classic 60s and 70s bands and indie groups from the 80s and 90s) often play these venues. Love them.

However I don't think this is likely to happen. The problems with Aberdeen are:

* It is one of the most geographically isolated cities in the UK. That is a fact. Therefore artists are less likely to make the journey.

* Aberdeen is about industry and work - it doesn't really have a lot in the way of culture. If you don't like drinking there is very little to do in Aberdeen at weekends.

* It sounds like a nasty and elitist thing to say, but people's musical tastes in Aberdeen are often pretty shit. Not everyone, but just look at the way crappy pop artists can fill the AECC, yet interesting groups often don't bother with Aberdeen and only do Glasgow as their sole Scottish date.

I've had to travel to Glasgow, Edinburgh, even Dundee and Kinross and the Highlands, to see groups I liked. I've also made quite a few trips down to England to see bands as well. If you are a regular gig goer Aberdeen can be a very expensive place to live due to travel and/or accommodation costs.

We should be thankful we have the Lemon Tree at least I guess, as well as the Music Hall and a handful of other small venues.

&gt; A Fine Frenzy is a band led by Alison Sudol (born December 23, 1984 in Seattle, Washington), an American singer, songwriter and pianist. They released their first studio album One Cell In The Sea on July 17, 2007.

&gt; Born in Seattle to dramatic-arts teacher parents, Alison moved to Los Angeles, US at the age of five. With her newly single mother, Alison moved frequently around the city. She developed a strong love for the fantastic literary worlds of CS Lewis, EB White, Lewis Carroll and Charles Dickens, while becoming a passionate author in her own right.

&gt; In an interview with www.spinner.com Alison Sudol shares how she came up with the band's name ""(I) had a bunch of books open on a table, ""a fine frenzy"" jumped off a page of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' [Shakespeare] and it was just right, though every now and then I wonder if it's a bit ... flowery.""

&gt; Alison also immersed herself in classical music, Motown, Aretha Franklin, swing bands, Ella Fitzgerald, Elton John, Louis Armstrong, the Beatles, Technicolor movies and classic 1950's television.

&gt; After teaching herself to play piano, Alison increasingly invested her internal narratives into song form. She found solace in the melodic melancholia of new global British bands Aqualung, Radiohead, Coldplay, Keane, etc... She was also moved by the diatonic minimalism of Philip Glass and the transportive allure of Icelandic music (Björk, Sigur Rós). She graduated from Delphi Academy Los Angeles in 2001. Inspired, Alison Sudol developed the sound of A Fine Frenzy - hypnotic piano arrangements under classic American melody fused into irresistible, atmospheric songs with the power to reach around the world.

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD ""Edgy In Brixton"" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London. The DVD contains a full live performance of the debut album Costello Music, B-Sides from various singles and a new song called Pretty Like a Girl. Extras on the DVD include the band being asked questions by members of The Fratellis' website, and on the deluxe edition, highlights from the T In The Park 2007 festival. It was released in the United States on the 30 October 2007

&gt; 2007-2008: Here We Stand

&gt; On November 20, 2007, it was announced on the Fratellis' official website that work had begun on the second album in rehearsal space in Glasgow. The band stated that they are self-producing the album and have their own studio to record in. Recording finished on January 13, 2008.

&gt; On February 22, 2008, they played a small show for fans at Queen Margaret Union to debut new songs from the upcoming album. About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. The first single from the album was called ""Mistress Mabel"" and was released on May 26, 2008. The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd. The Fratellis released a deluxe edition of Here We Stand internationally on December the 8th. The CD includes a new song titled 'Moriarty's Last Stand' and the accompanying DVD includes ""The Year Of The Thief"" (A documentary of the band on the road in the US); A live show filmed on June 18th 2008 at the Fillmore, San Francisco; performances of Milk and Money, Flathead and Mistress Mabel from Abbey Road Studios and the videos for the singles Mistress Mabel and Look Out Sunshine!
On April, 22 2010, both singer Jon Lawler and bassist Barry Wallace posted messages on their forum saying the band are unlikely to record together again soon.

&gt; The Fratellis have announced during June 2012 that they have decided to reform to help raise money for The Eilidh Brown Memorial Fund on the 15th of June at the MacRobert Centre in Stirling. The band plans on announcing more dates for later in the year.
The band then announced an extensive UK tour during December 2012 to take place in April 2013. During the UK tour, 3 more songs were debuted live; ""She's Not Gone Yet (But She's Leaving), Seven Days and Whiskey Saga.
On February 4th 2013, The Fratellis announced they had finished recording their third album, which was revealed to be called We Need Medicine with a release date of October 7th 2013. ""Seven Nights Seven Days"" was released as a single on September 29th. The album was recorded in Glasgow with Jon Fratelli and Stuart McCredie on production duties.

&gt; On the 24th of April 2013 it was announced that The Fratellis would be headlining Brownstock Festival in Essex on Sunday the 1st of September.

&gt; On the 22nd June 2013 The Fratellis headlined New College Commemoration Ball, a white-tie Ball set in the grounds of New College, Oxford.
On 13th October 2013 their new album We Need Medicine debuted at at number 26. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Simian Mobile Disco was originally formed as a traveling DJ duet, playing on the side of their early four-piece band Simian. They ultimately released a number of low profile singles, such as ""The Count"" on Kitsuné Music, but arguably gained more fame for their remixes of artists such as Muse, Klaxons, The Go!

&gt; Musically, Simian Mobile Disco is known for heavily stylized tracks —often with minimal instrumentation— that associate themselves with a particular hook (vocal or instrumental —see mix of ""Whoo! Alright, Yeah...Uh Huh"" by The Rapture), which is repeated throughout the track. There is often a breakdown (occasionally more —see mix of ""Magick"" by Klaxons) comprising noise, drums and sometimes synths and vocals.

&gt; The band's debut album, Attack Decay Sustain Release was released on 18 June 2007 on Wichita Recordings. Among the tracks included on it are ""Hustler"", ""Tits and Acid"", ""I Believe"", ""Hot Dog"" and lead single ""It's the Beat"", which features Ninja from UK indie band The Go! Team on vocals. The album contains five new tracks, and the European version includes a bonus disc. The album was preceded by two mix compilations in April and May, for the ""Bugged Out"" and ""Go Commando"" series respectively.

&gt; SMD supported Klaxons at Brixton Academy on the 5 December 2007 and The Chemical Brothers at Aintree Pavilion on 9 December 2007 and Brighton Centre on 12 December 2007. SMD made a mix for Mixmag that came free with the January 2008 issue of Mixmag. While working on their second studio album, they released a collection of remixed SMD originals entitled Sample and Hold, which contains eleven tracks and was released in the UK on July 28, 2008. A North American date has not yet been announced.

&gt; In January 2009, they announced on their Myspace page that a new album was supposed to come out in 2009. Soon after that, they released a new track ""Synthesise"", on 12 February, through a music video (directed by Kate Moross and Alex Sushon) that ""features live visual accompaniment"" for the track. Two days later, a new song was broadcast on the BBC Radio 1 named ""10,000 Horses Can't Be Wrong"", soon followed by the release on 6 March of the official music video on their YouTube channel.

&gt; Their sophomore studio album Temporary Pleasure was finally announced on the 6 May, featuring many guests that they have encountered by their work as producers or their worldly tour including Gruff Rhys of Super Furry Animals, Alexis Taylor of Hot Chip, Beth Ditto of Gossip, and Chris Keating of Yeasayer.

&gt; On New Years Eve 2009 Simian Mobile Disco will headline 'Get Loaded in the Dark' at the world famous Brixton Academy alongside Annie Mac (BBC Radio 1), Chase &amp; Status, Herve and Sub Focus.

&gt; On NYE SMD headlined The Greatest Show on Earth at Motion in Bristol with the Bugged Out rig and rocked. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD ""Edgy In Brixton"" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London. The DVD contains a full live performance of the debut album Costello Music, B-Sides from various singles and a new song called Pretty Like a Girl. Extras on the DVD include the band being asked questions by members of The Fratellis' website, and on the deluxe edition, highlights from the T In The Park 2007 festival. It was released in the United States on the 30 October 2007

&gt; 2007-2008: Here We Stand

&gt; On November 20, 2007, it was announced on the Fratellis' official website that work had begun on the second album in rehearsal space in Glasgow. The band stated that they are self-producing the album and have their own studio to record in. Recording finished on January 13, 2008.

&gt; On February 22, 2008, they played a small show for fans at Queen Margaret Union to debut new songs from the upcoming album. About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. The first single from the album was called ""Mistress Mabel"" and was released on May 26, 2008. The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd. The Fratellis released a deluxe edition of Here We Stand internationally on December the 8th. The CD includes a new song titled 'Moriarty's Last Stand' and the accompanying DVD includes ""The Year Of The Thief"" (A documentary of the band on the road in the US); A live show filmed on June 18th 2008 at the Fillmore, San Francisco; performances of Milk and Money, Flathead and Mistress Mabel from Abbey Road Studios and the videos for the singles Mistress Mabel and Look Out Sunshine!
On April, 22 2010, both singer Jon Lawler and bassist Barry Wallace posted messages on their forum saying the band are unlikely to record together again soon.

&gt; The Fratellis have announced during June 2012 that they have decided to reform to help raise money for The Eilidh Brown Memorial Fund on the 15th of June at the MacRobert Centre in Stirling. The band plans on announcing more dates for later in the year.
The band then announced an extensive UK tour during December 2012 to take place in April 2013. During the UK tour, 3 more songs were debuted live; ""She's Not Gone Yet (But She's Leaving), Seven Days and Whiskey Saga.
On February 4th 2013, The Fratellis announced they had finished recording their third album, which was revealed to be called We Need Medicine with a release date of October 7th 2013. ""Seven Nights Seven Days"" was released as a single on September 29th. The album was recorded in Glasgow with Jon Fratelli and Stuart McCredie on production duties.

&gt; On the 24th of April 2013 it was announced that The Fratellis would be headlining Brownstock Festival in Essex on Sunday the 1st of September.

&gt; On the 22nd June 2013 The Fratellis headlined New College Commemoration Ball, a white-tie Ball set in the grounds of New College, Oxford.
On 13th October 2013 their new album We Need Medicine debuted at at number 26. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Bridging the worlds of indie and mainstream pop with big synths and bigger hooks, Glasgow's electro-pop trio Chvrches features singer Lauren Mayberry and keyboardists/vocalists Iain Cook and Martin Doherty. In September 2011, Mayberry, who previously played with the band Blue Sky Archives and holds a law degree as well as a master's degree in journalism, began working with Cook, a former member of Aerogramme and a film and television music composer, and Doherty, a touring member of the Twilight Sad, when they asked her to sing on some demos they were recording. The sessions went so well that the trio christened itself Chvrches -- spelling it with a ""v"" instead of a ""u"" to differentiate themselves in Internet searches -- and began writing songs inspired by Prince, Depeche Mode, and Kate Bush. Two of these songs, ""The Mother We Share"" and ""Lies,"" earned online buzz, and in November 2012, the band released ""The Mother We Share"" as their debut single. Late that year, Chvrches were among the acts selected for the BBC's Sound of 2013, ultimately finishing fifth. The trio began 2013 by playing a few North American dates, releasing the Recover EP and recording its debut album in Cook's basement studio. After covering Bauhaus' ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" for the movie Vampire Academy: Blood Sisters, Chvrches began working on new material in January 2015 at their own Alucard Studios. Taking inspiration from Quincy Jones' lean yet massive-sounding production style, their second album Every Open Eye appeared in September 2015. The album's singles included a version of ""Bury It"" that featured Paramore's Hayley Williams. In 2016, the band collaborated with Solar Fields on ""Warning Call,"" which appeared in the video game Mirror's Edge Catalyst. The following year, Chvrches contributed a cover of Tegan and Sara's ""Call it Off"" to the 10th anniversary edition of the duo's album The Con, and went into the studio with producers Greg Kurstin and Dave Stewart to work on their third album. Boasting a bigger, more straightforward sound than their previous releases, 2018's Love is Dead included the singles ""Get Out"" and ""My Enemy,"" a collaboration with the National's Matt Berninger.

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

&gt; Glen Hansard (born 21 April 1970) is an Irish singer-songwriter and actor. He is vocalist and guitarist for Irish group  The Frames and one half of folk-rock duo The Swell Season.

&gt; Hansard is said to have quit school at age 13 to begin busking on local Dublin streets. He first came to public attention as guitar player 'Outspan Foster' in the Alan Parker film The Commitments, a role he subsequently regretted, believing it distracted from his music career. In 2003 he presented the first series of Other Voices: Songs from a Room, which showcased Irish music talent on RTÉ. The album The Swell Season, in collaboration with a Czech singer and multi-instrumentalist Markéta Irglová, was released on in 2006 (the album also featured Marja Tuhkanen and Bertrand Galen).

&gt; Hansard starred in the movie 'Once' alongside Markéta Irglová which won a prestigious Sundance Audience Award in 2007, as well as the 2008 Academy Award for Best Original Song (for ""Falling Slowly""), beating three songs from the Disney musical ""Enchanted"" and one song from ""August Rush"" (both were heavy contenders). Its Irish release took place on 23rd March 2007 and appeared in cinemas further afield later in the year.

&gt; Hansard's album, Rhythm and Repose, was released in June 2012. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Anya Marina is a singer-songwriter and radio disc jockey based in San Diego, Calif. Her music has been featured on the ABC television drama Grey's Anatomy (and its second soundtrack) and on shows such as MTV's The Real World. She is also track 6 on New Moon soundtrack. Anya is a former deejay on KBZT (FM94/9) in San Diego.

&gt; Anya was born in Ann Arbor, Mich., and grew up in the Silicon Valley area of California as a capricious child with Russian-Agnostic/Irish-Catholic professor parents (psychology and russian literature/math) and a younger sister. After finishing high school, Anya moved to Los Angeles as an aspiring actress. With stints in the British American Drama Academy (taught by Richard Dreyfuss, Marsha Mason, Anne Jackson and Eli Wallach) and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Pasadena, Anya has also acted in television and film (in 2001, she starred in the feature film, 100 Girls). She eventually moved back home to earn a college degree in English and writing at Santa Clara University. She continued to struggle as an artist -- working in acting, musical theatre, music, improv and comedy -- but eventually found a job as a radio DJ on KSCU, Santa Clara University's college station.

&gt; After graduating, Anya took a radio station job in San Diego with Mike Halloran at XHRM-FM (92.5). After the station was bought out by another corporation, Halloran hired Anya at Y107 in Los Angeles before they both moved to Premium Radio 92/1 in San Diego's North County. After leaving that station, both disc jockeys landed at FM94/9.

&gt; It was in San Diego that Anya played her first open mic night and began to write her own songs. She quickly developed a live stage act using what she learned as an actress, comic and impressionist. Her recorded debut was a five-song EP called Exercises in Racketeering, which eventually led to a full-length album, Miss Halfway, which was released in early 2005. Anya subsequently opened for such artists as Jason Mraz and Rhett Miller. She was named one of the ""Best Unsigned"" acts by San Diego CityBeat.

&gt; The songs on Miss Halfway talk about her upbringing, ex-boyfriends and all the after-effects. Anya's album was also produced by Scott Russo, the frontman for rockers Unwritten Law, along with Peter King from The Surfers. The record eventually earned a San Diego Music Award for Best Recording. The title track also landed on Grey's Anatomy and was featured as the fifth song on the second Grey's Anatomy (soundtrack) disc along with The Fray, KT Tunstall, Gomez and Snow Patrol.

&gt; The internet radio station KGRL featured her as their Flower-Powered Artist for March of 2007. The feature includes an exclusive interview, CD Review of Miss Halfway, and an on-demand audio stream of an unreleased Anya Marina track titled ""Try It And Like It."" Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Janelle Monáe is a U.S. singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and performer.

&gt; Monáe was born Janelle Monáe Robinson on 1st December 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas. She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

&gt; Life began for Kamasi Washington on February 18, 1981 in Los Angeles, California. In the Washington family music was more of a prerequisite than a privilege. But Kamasi never saw it that way, his love for music began at first sound. His father, Rickey Washington is a professional saxophonist by night and a high school music teacher by day. Kamasi’s mother, Valerie Washington is an accomplished flutist who fell in love with the world of science and became a high school chemistry teacher after her stint as a genetic researcher. By the age of two Kamasi had already began to play the drums and piano, the only thing that kept him away from the wind instruments at that early age was his lack of dental development. He began his exploration into the world of the reeds and brass when he was about seven and his father gave him a clarinet. By the age of twelve Kamasi had found his voice in the form of a tenor saxophone, in fact it was the same saxophone that his father played in high school. 

&gt; Over the next year Kamasi’s development and devotion to music had out grown his academic environment. So he transferred from The Los Angeles Center of Enriched Studies (one the top academic high schools in the nation) and enrolled into the Hamilton High School Music Academy. It was around this time that Kamasi also joined The Multi School Jazz Band (M.S.J.B.), an assembly of the finest young jazz musicians in Los Angeles County and led by Reginald Andrews the same man that taught Kamasi’s father in high school. Because of the sheer vastness of talent that he was surrounded by it was in The Multi School Jazz Band that Kamasi was most inspired during his high school years. Through M.S.J.B. Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi’s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as “The Young Jazz Giants”. 
This fiery group of “Young Giants” wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year “The Young Jazz Giants” had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. 

&gt; After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson’s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album “In My Time” which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi’s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called “Bird Man Records” heard him playing with “The Young Jazz Giants” and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the “big break” for “The Young Jazz Giants” but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after its completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay “ready and waiting” for too long, thus “The Young Jazz Giants” unofficially disbanded. 

&gt; Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called “The Next Step” and that’s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking. 

&gt; (2) Kamasi Washington didn't pick up a saxophone until he was 13 years old, but by that point, he'd been playing several other instruments. That's when he found his calling. Within a couple years, he was the lead tenor saxophonist at Hamilton High School Music Academy in his native Los Angeles. After graduation, he attended UCLA to study ethnomusicology. While enrolled at UCLA, he recorded a self-titled album with Young Jazz Giants, a quartet he had formed with Cameron Graves and brothers Ronald Bruner, Jr. and Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner, released in 2004. From that point, Washington continually performed and recorded with an impressive variety of major artists across several genres, including Snoop Dogg, Raphael Saadiq, Gerald Wilson, McCoy Tyner, George Duke, and PJ Morton. In 2014 alone, Washington demonstrated tremendous range with appearances on Broken Bells' After the Disco, Harvey Mason's Chameleon, Stanley Clarke's Up, and Flying Lotus' You're Dead!, among other albums that covered indie rock, contemporary and progressive jazz, and experimental electronic music. 

&gt;  The following year, Washington contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly and finally debuted as a leader with The Epic, released on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label. An expansive triple album nearly three hours in duration, it involved the other three-quarters of Young Jazz Giants -- by then part of his larger ten piece collective, altnerately known as The Next Step and West Coast Get Down-- string orchestra and choir conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. 

&gt;  The Epic was a critical and commerial success. Not only did it land at number three on the jazz charts, it also found its way on to independent albums and heatseekers charts as well. Washington and his band were not only able to tour the U.S., but to play in Europe and Japan as well. ~ Andy Kellman

&gt; New LP, Broken Devotion, out now!

&gt; Free download of a new Mint Julep track 'Tame': https://soundcloud.com/keithkenniff/mint-julep-tame-free-download

&gt; Other projects by Keith Kenniff: Helios and Goldmund.

&gt; Formed in Boston, Massachusetts, in 2007, Mint Julep is the husband-and-wife team of Hollie and Keith Kenniff. Subsequently relocating to Portland, Oregon, the duo cut a limited release album, Songs About Snow, in 2008 – effectively a trial run for further recording in their home studio, the fruit of which is a sublime follow-up, Save Your Season, released in 2011. The duo self-released Broken Devotion on Unseen in 2015. An ambient album, A Deep and Dreamless Sleep, is slated for release in late 2016.

&gt; Hallmarked by Hollie’s seductive, dreamy vocals and a succession of memorably soaring choruses, all of it etched with Keith’s vivid, glinting keyboards, towering guitars and miscellaneous instrumental hooks, Mint Julep make lustrous modern pop music that is wistful and mellifluous yet simultaneously powerful, even epic – equal parts shoegazing romanticism and cool, Kraftwerkian polish. Their songs seem instantly familiar, like old musical friends, a ’classicism’ offset by the freshness and luminosity they exude as they usher you on a breathless ride through the sunlit uplands of electronic indie-rock.

&gt; Mint Julep was designed as a conscious departure from Keith’s previous, ambient- orientated projects. “When Hollie and I set out to do something, I wanted to find some way to incorporate her vocals into a slightly different style, rather than just write similar material to my solo work and lay her vocals over top”, he says. “I had the need to write something that had some distorted guitars, loud drums and was a little bolder than what I had previously done. We messed around with a track one night (which became ‘Stay’) and it was a fun process, so we just kept writing more songs so we could do a project together.”
Soon a working pattern emerged, with Keith composing music around Hollie’s lyrics or making tracks which Hollie would then add to. “It just developed after a lot of trial and error, and after a while the material started to plateau and began to sound like an album…”

&gt; A Pennsylvannian by birth, Keith Kenniff is an honours graduate of Boston’s esteemed Berklee College of Music, best known as the brains behind dulcet ambient/electronic practitioners Helios and the fingers on the ivories of post-classical piano minimalists Goldmund (the latter’s music once described by no less an authority than Ryuichi Sakamoto as “…so, so, so beautiful…”). A succession of albums under those aliases has made Kenniff the darling of discerning critics and his music has also been widely used in film, television and advertising, not least on the soundtrack to Harmony Korine’s 2007 comedy-drama Mister Lonely and the trailer for the 2009 Academy Award-nominated Revolutionary Road, directed by Sam Mendes.

&gt; Originally from Ohio, singer Hollie Kenniff maintains dual US/Canadian citizenship, having spent part of her life in Ontario. Aside from Mint Julep, she has collaborated on several additional musical endeavors in tandem with husband Keith, including a children’s music project, Meadows, (inspired by the couple’s young son), whose debut longplayer was recently released, and an ambient diversion under their own names.

&gt; Janelle Monáe is a U.S. singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and performer.

&gt; Monáe was born Janelle Monáe Robinson on 1st December 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas. She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

&gt; Dr. Who Dat? aka Jneiro Jarel is an American hip-hop producer &amp; MC. His releases include Three Piece Puzzle on Dutch label Kindred Spirits &amp; Beat Journey on Lex Records. In 2006 Dr. Who Dat? also created his own 'supergroup' Shape Of Broad Minds and have released The Blue Experience EP and Craft Of The Lost Art. 

&gt; Live and direct out of the Brooklyn borough on down to Philly, Jneiro Jarel has slowly been digging his way up through the hip-hop underground for 15 years. At the age of 5, Jneiro's family moved out of the Brownsville section of Brooklyn. His mother was in the army, and as a result, he lived in many places (Maryland, Arizona, Georgia, etc.) finally touching down in Houston Texas circa 1985.

&gt; The Houston Years (1985-1998)
With hip-hop in his blood freestyle experience stirred thick in his back-back, Omar Jarel Gilyard made the transformation into a professional rapper upon touching down in Houston Texas circa 1992 where he took his skills to the streets, quickly landing gigs with Houston notables Hi Five, YZ, Special Ed, and eventually forming and producing The Slum Kids aka Rhythmic Crew in 1994 (the group also included Aahtue and Nahuma both of whom make guest appearances on 3PP) . Rocking shows and free-styling with The Pharcyde, Prodigy of Mobb Deep, The Geto Boys, etc. Life in H-Town's underground hip-hop scene was fresh and fierce, but being a big fish in a small town led him to seek out bigger seas.

&gt; 
The New York Years (1998-2004)
In 98, Jneiro felt he had to leave the group and relocate back to NY to realize his dreams. Upon the return he officially changed his name to Jneiro Jarel and quickly became a fixture in Okayplayer’s ""Black Lily"" gigs at The Wetlands and Butterfly Cafe. Public Enemy producer Hank Shocklee later “discovered” JJ through MP3.com and instantly had him opening up for Julie Dexter, Lord Finesse and others. While the deal stalled, JJ honed his production skills and started to build a buzz for his skills behind the board. By 2003 Jneiro was the sole representative from New York to participate and perform at The Red Bull Music Academy in Cape Town, South Africa.

&gt; The Philly Years (2003 – Present)
Through his success in the indie-music scene, he has come to link up with well known dee jay/producers such as Rich Medina, King Britt and The Marksmen. He also has collaborated with Jazzanova, DKD, Lizz Fields, Tiombe Lockhart, Fertile Ground, Andrew Edward Brown &amp; Vinia Mojica. Showing his diversity as a producer, Jneiro Jarel has teamed up with artists such as Rocque Wun, Mel Owens, and Capital Peoples, producing a wide range of styles from acid jazz, afro-brazilian, hip-hop to broken beat.

&gt; In 2006, Jneiro Jarel set off on a pan-American voyage to assemble a team of rappers and producers who shared his aim... to create a unique hip hop record unbothered by trend, time and location. In 2007 Shape of Broad Minds is a force to be reckoned with.

&gt; Bringing together Dr Who Dat? aka Jneiro Jarel, multi-instrumentalist and rapper jAWWAAD from Houston, Panama Black (aka Jneiro Jarel) from Atlanta, and Rocque Wun (aka Jneiro Jarel) from NYC. The group released their debut The Blue Experience EP on July 29th, 2007 on Lex Records. August 26th, 2007 saw the release of the groups full length album Craft Of The Lost Art, featuring guest spots by MF DOOM, John Robinson aka Lil Sci, Count Bass D, Deborah Jordon and Stacy Epps.

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD ""Edgy In Brixton"" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London. The DVD contains a full live performance of the debut album Costello Music, B-Sides from various singles and a new song called Pretty Like a Girl.

About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. The first single from the album was called ""Mistress Mabel"" and was released on May 26, 2008. The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd.

Motion/Marble factory usually do club nights and DJs, but occasionally they get a few good rock bands. 

02 Bristol is usually medium to bigger bands that do academy tours, the kind of band that would be a supporting act at your stadium venues but not the headliner (at least for a few more years). 

There is the exchange/stag and hounds, ive never been there by my brother plays their a lot, or at least used to a few years back. Its basically a pub with a small venue, same can be said for the Louisianna. 

The Thekla is usually more indie from what i can tell. Dont think i have ever been interested in a band that has played there. 

Thats the majority of the bristol venues. The Bierkeller used to do more metal than the other venues, but they closed recently. 

If you go further afield cardiff have a few good venues too, the Student Union (YPLAS and Great Hall) is their equivalent of the 02. The motorpoint arena is pretty lousy for rock acts. Its usually the huge pop groups and comedians. (though i did see Iron Maiden last may)

The Globe in cardiff i think is a rock bar, and usually does smaller rock acts and tributes. 

Cardiff isnt too bad to get to if you drive. Usually takes about an hour and 15/30 to get into the center and parked, but only really takes an hours on the way back.

I really thought the movie sucked though so I give people a hard time who try to defend it.  I hope I didn’t hurt your feelings.   I reflected my hate for this movie inappropriately and I acted like a complete dick.  My anger should have been completely at these guys who made it.  I have to remind that they are indie art film makers. I used to work at NBC Universal for a long time and for my first movie experience, our team worked with Brian Grazer on A Beautiful Mind (I was only an intern at the time), but I think that was a decent movie compared to A Florida Project, which I just don’t feel is Academy worthy with a plot involving kids spitting on cars and no plot.  We knew she would have Social Services take her away.  The writing was not rich, deep, but most of all, not inspiring, (almost like leaving no hope for people in a similar situation).  Films used to be more positive and in a time with Trump, a questionable economic future for the middle class, and so many other world issues that give people fear, hope and happy endings need to be produced again. None of this depressing shit because it makes people even more depressed.  I majored in music theory and film editing at SC, but I loved studying psychology and wrote a lot of papers on the psychology of film and how it affects people in real life.  

I was just over at Pixar Studios on Friday watching my friend do the music editing on Incredibles 2. We were roommates at USC and we have a company that does live music concerts for Star Wars and many other classic movies with Symphonies around the US and Europe so my passion for good movies runs deep.  Incredibles will be a decent movie.  My friends and I had a discussion about what we all thought of a Florida Project and we all thought it was just so different from what was created 10 years ago. A lot of these Hollywood films right now are so dramatic and depressing on purpose.  Not my style. Ok, have a good day.

&gt; Mission of Burma is an American post-punk band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1979. The band was formed by Roger Miller (guitar), Clint Conley (bass), Peter Prescott (drums) and Martin Swope (tape manipulator/sound engineer). Miller, Conley and Prescott share singing and songwriting duties. Like many of their post-punk contemporaries, Mission of Burma's efforts are largely concerned with extending punk's original vocabulary without losing its essential rebellious spirit. Using rapid shifts in dynamics, unconventional time signatures and chord progressions along with tape effects, Mission of Burma challenges the prevailing idioms of punk while attempting to retain its power and immediacy.

&gt; In early years the band's audience was limited to the Boston area, with all their recordings released on the small Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. The band released only one album in its original form, Vs.. Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope, and has since recorded two more albums, ONoffON and The Obliterati.

&gt; Their wall-of-noise musical sound extended the vocabulary of punk while continuing to hold clear its sense of power and abandon.  They used a number of tape effects, different chord progressions, and time shifts to highlight their formal training in music.  Not only that but they are seen now as a highly influential band to both post-punk and experimental music to come after; many bands cite Burma as an inspiration, including Nirvana, Superchunk, Creed, The Grifters, R.E.M. (who regularly covered ""Academy Fight Song"" on their Green tour), Sonic Youth, Throwing Muses, Yo La Tengo, Soul Asylum, Pixies, Sugar, Catherine Wheel, Guided by Voices, Graham Coxon and Moby - the last two of which have covered """"That's When I Reach For My Revolver.""

&gt; The band were due to tour in 1980 with Joy Division but the suicide of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's singer, canceled the tour. In 1983, after releasing their only full-length studio record Vs., the group disbanded due to Miller's worsening tinnitus.

&gt; The band found increasing relevance throughout the 90s, culminating in the publication of Michael Azzerad's essays Our Band Could Be Your Life which featured Mission of Burma. In 2002, they reunited and began playing reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and formerly Prescott's Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller relates that ""when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin's position, we told him he could use current digital technology which accomplishes Martin's antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted for maintaining the original integrity, and uses a tape deck.""

&gt; Life began for Kamasi Washington on February 18, 1981 in Los Angeles, California. In the Washington family music was more of a prerequisite than a privilege. But Kamasi never saw it that way, his love for music began at first sound. His father, Rickey Washington is a professional saxophonist by night and a high school music teacher by day. Kamasi’s mother, Valerie Washington is an accomplished flutist who fell in love with the world of science and became a high school chemistry teacher after her stint as a genetic researcher. By the age of two Kamasi had already began to play the drums and piano, the only thing that kept him away from the wind instruments at that early age was his lack of dental development. He began his exploration into the world of the reeds and brass when he was about seven and his father gave him a clarinet. By the age of twelve Kamasi had found his voice in the form of a tenor saxophone, in fact it was the same saxophone that his father played in high school. 

&gt; Over the next year Kamasi’s development and devotion to music had out grown his academic environment. So he transferred from The Los Angeles Center of Enriched Studies (one the top academic high schools in the nation) and enrolled into the Hamilton High School Music Academy. It was around this time that Kamasi also joined The Multi School Jazz Band (M.S.J.B.), an assembly of the finest young jazz musicians in Los Angeles County and led by Reginald Andrews the same man that taught Kamasi’s father in high school. Because of the sheer vastness of talent that he was surrounded by it was in The Multi School Jazz Band that Kamasi was most inspired during his high school years. Through M.S.J.B. Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi’s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as “The Young Jazz Giants”. 
This fiery group of “Young Giants” wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year “The Young Jazz Giants” had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. 

&gt; After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson’s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album “In My Time” which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi’s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called “Bird Man Records” heard him playing with “The Young Jazz Giants” and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the “big break” for “The Young Jazz Giants” but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after its completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay “ready and waiting” for too long, thus “The Young Jazz Giants” unofficially disbanded. 

&gt; Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called “The Next Step” and that’s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking. 

&gt; (2) Kamasi Washington didn't pick up a saxophone until he was 13 years old, but by that point, he'd been playing several other instruments. That's when he found his calling. Within a couple years, he was the lead tenor saxophonist at Hamilton High School Music Academy in his native Los Angeles. After graduation, he attended UCLA to study ethnomusicology. While enrolled at UCLA, he recorded a self-titled album with Young Jazz Giants, a quartet he had formed with Cameron Graves and brothers Ronald Bruner, Jr. and Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner, released in 2004. From that point, Washington continually performed and recorded with an impressive variety of major artists across several genres, including Snoop Dogg, Raphael Saadiq, Gerald Wilson, McCoy Tyner, George Duke, and PJ Morton. In 2014 alone, Washington demonstrated tremendous range with appearances on Broken Bells' After the Disco, Harvey Mason's Chameleon, Stanley Clarke's Up, and Flying Lotus' You're Dead!, among other albums that covered indie rock, contemporary and progressive jazz, and experimental electronic music. 

&gt;  The following year, Washington contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly and finally debuted as a leader with The Epic, released on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label. An expansive triple album nearly three hours in duration, it involved the other three-quarters of Young Jazz Giants -- by then part of his larger ten piece collective, altnerately known as The Next Step and West Coast Get Down-- string orchestra and choir conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. 

&gt;  The Epic was a critical and commerial success. Not only did it land at number three on the jazz charts, it also found its way on to independent albums and heatseekers charts as well. Washington and his band were not only able to tour the U.S., but to play in Europe and Japan as well. ~ Andy Kellman

&gt; Mission of Burma is an American post-punk band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1979. The band was formed by Roger Miller (guitar), Clint Conley (bass), Peter Prescott (drums) and Martin Swope (tape manipulator/sound engineer). Miller, Conley and Prescott share singing and songwriting duties. Like many of their post-punk contemporaries, Mission of Burma's efforts are largely concerned with extending punk's original vocabulary without losing its essential rebellious spirit. Using rapid shifts in dynamics, unconventional time signatures and chord progressions along with tape effects, Mission of Burma challenges the prevailing idioms of punk while attempting to retain its power and immediacy.

&gt; In early years the band's audience was limited to the Boston area, with all their recordings released on the small Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. The band released only one album in its original form, Vs.. Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope, and has since recorded two more albums, ONoffON and The Obliterati.

&gt; Their wall-of-noise musical sound extended the vocabulary of punk while continuing to hold clear its sense of power and abandon.  They used a number of tape effects, different chord progressions, and time shifts to highlight their formal training in music.  Not only that but they are seen now as a highly influential band to both post-punk and experimental music to come after; many bands cite Burma as an inspiration, including Nirvana, Superchunk, Creed, The Grifters, R.E.M. (who regularly covered ""Academy Fight Song"" on their Green tour), Sonic Youth, Throwing Muses, Yo La Tengo, Soul Asylum, Pixies, Sugar, Catherine Wheel, Guided by Voices, Graham Coxon and Moby - the last two of which have covered """"That's When I Reach For My Revolver.""

&gt; The band were due to tour in 1980 with Joy Division but the suicide of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's singer, canceled the tour. In 1983, after releasing their only full-length studio record Vs., the group disbanded due to Miller's worsening tinnitus.

&gt; The band found increasing relevance throughout the 90s, culminating in the publication of Michael Azzerad's essays Our Band Could Be Your Life which featured Mission of Burma. In 2002, they reunited and began playing reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and formerly Prescott's Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller relates that ""when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin's position, we told him he could use current digital technology which accomplishes Martin's antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted for maintaining the original integrity, and uses a tape deck.""

&gt; Esteban Mateus Williamson, better known as Esteman (born May 4, 1984) is a Colombian singer and songwriter.
Esteman has been developing his interest in music since the age of 12, as he attended several music and theatre academies, acting classes and college education in Electronic Media Arts. At a prodigiously young age Esteman started writing songs and school plays involving musical theatre for his elementary school and ever since, writing and performing has become one of his favorites activities. Later on, while he was in college, Esteman decided to pursue his music career full-time, he found in music a perfect space where he was able to focus in his main interest: music.
This is how Esteman's musical project begins, mixing styles and influences in order to build catchy melodies loaded with irony, where the plastic sounds of a synthesizer get together with percussion elements both usual and inusual, saxophones and old school guitars as we can hear in his first single ""No te metas a mi Facebook"" which translates ""Dont bother me on Facebook"".

&gt; With a careful fusion of elements where you can find eclectic pop, disco music, indie-pop, the most thought provoking lyrics and choreography, Esteman's project gets launched in the latin pop market with a musical, visual and performative proposal that will make you vibrate until the end of this song.

&gt; Janelle Monáe is a U.S. singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and performer.

&gt; Monáe was born Janelle Monáe Robinson on 1st December 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas. She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

* [Opera]( http://www.opera.hu/?lan=en): Budapest’s premier cultural institution and the most accessible to foreigners by nature, a visit to this breath-takingly ornate building should not be missed. The option to do so touristically, visiting the building itself on a guided tour, is available, but the real deal is attending a performance. Numerous third-party sites offer tickets here, but avoid them – why pay extra if you can just buy directly on the site? All plays are surtitled in English. NOTE: the **building is currently being renovated** with a planned re-opening of **January 2019**! Shows are held at their auxilliary location, Erkel Theatre until that date. 

* An [organ concert]( https://www.jegy.hu/venue/szent-istvan-bazilika?lang=en) at St. Stephen’s Basilica: usually on Mondays or Thursdays in the late afternoon or evening. 

* Authentic folk dance evenings are held in [Fonó]( http://www.fono.hu/en) every Wednesday, and irregularly on other days as well. Folk and folk jazz concerts are another main feature. 

* [Budapest Jazz Club]( https://www.bjc.hu/home/): indulge in a night of casual jamming, the best Hungarian or international jazz musicians, as your preferences and the [schedule]( https://www.bjc.hu/programs/all-programs) allows! For a more casual evening, [Jedermann]( http://www.jedermann.hu/) is a superb alternative. 

* [Budapest Spring Festival]( https://www.btf.hu/events?day=&amp;archive=&amp;ob=time_stamp&amp;od=a&amp;rpp=19&amp;q=&amp;rt=list): BSF is the reason the season’s most notable classical, jazz and world music concerts tend to take place in April. Also overlaps with the National Theatre’s international theatre festival, MITEM.

* [Palace of Arts (Müpa)]( https://www.mupa.hu/en): with the Bartók National Concert Hall voted one of the top concert halls of the world, Müpa hosts high-profile orchestras, jazz, world music concerts and more in season (September to June). If they aren’t touring internationally, try to catch the [Budapest Festival Orchestra]( https://www.bfz.hu/en)!  It’s also home to Budapest’s best contemporary art museum, Ludwig.

* [Franz Liszt Academy of Music]( http://zeneakademia.hu/en/all-programs): a great alternative to Müpa for chamber music and more. 

* [National Theatre]( https://nemzetiszinhaz.hu/en): the most grandiose of theatre buildings in the country, however the quality of shows can be erratic. Nonetheless worth a visit if you’re here in April, as they host the country’s only international theatre festival, MITEM. Tickets [go on sale]( https://www.jegymester.hu/eng/PlaceInfo/30000/Nemzeti-Szinhaz#anchor_list) around late January and the best plays sell out fast. All plays surtitled in English, but don’t sit at the very front as the screens are to the sides of the stage. Located right next to Müpa. 

* [Katona József Theatre]( http://katonajozsefszinhaz.hu/english/): considered the best drama theatre by most, Katona offers shows with English subtitles infrequently (0-2 times a month). Due to their immense popularity with locals and most of their nights sell out 6 weeks in advance. But if you’re a threatre fan planning a visit to Budapest, do try to score some tickets. Subtitles are best seen from rows 8-12. [Tickets go on sale]( https://www.jegymester.hu/eng/PlaceInfo/80241/Katona-Jozsef-Theatre#anchor_list) at 11.00 local time on the 15th of every month, or the following weekday if 15th falls on a weekend or holiday. The [schedule]( http://katonajozsefszinhaz.hu/whats-on) is available in English, but only shows explicitly marked ’with English subtitles’ are suitable. It is published a week or so before ticket sales open. 

* [Uránia National Film Theatre]( http://www.urania-nf.hu/now_showing) : the imposing home of Hungarian cinema, Uránia screens most of their movies in original audio with Hungarian subtitles – but remember, the production language isn’t always English. 
Similarly good indie cinemas are Puskin, Művész and Cirko-Gejzír. Mainstream cinemas normally dub mainstream films, though increasingly they toss in an English screening or two per day. Check the day’s schedule on [Est]( http://est.hu/en/cinema/english_screenings/).



**Sport events**

* The quality of Hungarian **football** was signaled by the national team’s recent losses to powerhouses Luxembourg, Kazakhstan and Andorra with an away tie at the Faroes and the league isn’t an inch better. But the PM Orbán’s famous fanaticism of the game means the facilities are usually brand new – and mostly empty. 

 The most popular club is **[Ferencváros (FTC)]( http://www.fradi.hu/en/)**. To combat hooliganism, all spectators must register for a supporter card, which involves taking a photo, showing ID and scanning your veins. This is just a few minutes long administrative process, but nonetheless arrive a least an hour before the game to complete it, there might be some queueing. Without a supporter card you can only buy tickets in person, but there’s zero risk of a sold-out game. Tickets for the best seats cost €15-25. They have a fan shop.  

 In case FTC is playing an away game, arch-rival Újpest or storied Vasas or Honvéd could be okay alternatives. 

* Something we’re actually great at, the **water polo** championship is among the world’s strongest with numerous Olympic champions playing in Hungary. Check the schedule for both men’s and women’s [here]( http://www.waterpolo.hu/bajnoksagok/), switch to English at the top right and don’t forget to use the roll down menu – the men’s championship is split into two even-skilled groups of A and B.

 The two top teams play in the countryside (Eger and Szolnok), but are closely trailed by Champions League and Euro Cup participants [FTC]( https://www.facebook.com/fradivizilabda/) and [OSC-Újbuda]( https://www.facebook.com/oscwaterpolo/). FTC plays at Népliget swimming pool (Üllői út 129., M3 subway to Népliget and cross the park), OSC at Kondorosi út 14. (tram #47 from Deák Ferenc tér to ’Albertfalva kitérő’). Tickets should cost around €4, can only be bought ont he spot prior to the game, without the risk of selling out. 

 [UVSE]( https://www.facebook.com/UVSE.Official/) is the dominant women’s team which plays at the Alfréd Hajós National Swimming Pool on Margitsziget. 

 That is the official home of the men’s and women’s national team as well, but they tend to play all around the country and not that often. 

* Both of FTC’s **handball** teams play in the top league, although the women’s team is much more established as #2 behind world-class Győr, and a regular Champions’ League participant. They play their national championship and domestic cup games at Gyula Elek Arena at Kőbányai út 47./A, but their CL-games are in Dabas, 50kms away. 

* **Ice hockey** has a small, but dedicated following and a less-than-spectacular quality to the [league]( http://www.jegkorongszovetseg.hu/ersteliga/schedule). Here [MAC]( http://macbudapesthockey.hu/esemenyek/) is the top Budapest team (but FTC fields a fine team as well), and play their games at Tüskecsarnok (Hevesy György út), as does the [national team]( http://www.jegkorongszovetseg.hu/program) (the English version of the site is outdated, use Google Translate ont he Hungarian) in the IIHF Division I/B. The country's top club competes in the much stronger Austrian league and plays their home games in Székesfehérvár. 

* Well-ranked women’s **volleyball** teams in Budapest are 5x champion former powerhouse [Vasas]( http://www.vasasvolleyball.hu/index/) (under ’Mérkőzések’, each cup a different menu) and #3 [UTE]( https://www.volleycapak.hu/merkozesek). Surprisingly no FTC here!

 [Pénzügyőr](http://www.penzugyorse.hu/pse_plugins/calendar_menu/calendar.php) is #4 in the men's championship with games at Kőér u. 2/B.

&gt; Songwriter Oren Lavie (Tel Aviv, Israel), who has drawn comparisons in the press to Nick Drake, the Beatles and Crosby Stills &amp; Nash, released his debut album “The Opposite Side Of The Sea” on March 10th, 2009 on his own imprint, A Quarter Past Wonderful, which he started with tastemaker and current KCRW host Chris Douridas.  Says Douridas, a 27-year veteran of radio, “I've never been so motivated to help an artist get his music out into the world until I met Oren. He is incredibly special. It's rare every song in an artist's catalogue moves me like Oren’s do.""

&gt; The album is as eclectic as Oren’s home bases of Tel Aviv, Israel (where he was born), Berlin Germany (where he recorded the album), and Los Angeles, CA (the home of his new label). It was released in Europe and immediately garnered great press with Uncut raving in a four-star review that the album is “cinematic and mellow, like Nick Drake in a cheerful summer bonnet…”

&gt; Many people in the US will be familiar with Oren’s music as his album track ‘Her Morning Elegance’ was featured in a national ad campaign for Chevy Malibu. He also wrote the end credit “A Dance ‘Round the Memory Tree” for the film The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian joining Regina Spektor and Hanne Hukkelberg on the soundtrack.

&gt; Born in Tel-Aviv, Israel, Oren began his creative journey as a playwright. At the age of 21 he wrote and directed a play for the Israeli Fringe Theater Festival, which won the awards for best newcomer writer and director. He later moved to London on a scholarship to attend the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts. While still at school he wrote a play he later directed in an Off West-end theater to critical acclaim. The production was named by Time-Out London as one of the best 5 shows in London during its run. Oren moved to NY where he gradually began to shift his focus from playwriting to a shorter form of storytelling, the song. Two years later he relocated to Berlin and began work on The Opposite Side of The Sea.

&gt; In 2007 the album was released in Europe, then found its way to the KCRW playlist in LA. Shortly after that the album track ‘Her Morning Elegance’ was synched to a Chevrolet Malibu TV campaign. Oren, who does not own a television and has not driven a car for 10 years, continues to ride the bus. With the earnings from the TV ad he started his own label in the US, named it, then renamed it, changed it again and finally decided to call it Quarter Past Wonderful. He then released The Opposite Side Of The Sea on iTunes US, where it climbed to #30 on the charts.

&gt; Oren Lavie's music doesn't come right at you through the front door; its elliptical nature is mysterious and dense and remains slightly unresolved. His vignettes of life are heartbreaking. One can hear his playwright past in his narratives as his songs unfold like a collection of short stories in musical poetic form.

&gt; Floater began in 1993 when Robert Wynia (lead vocals, bass), Peter Cornett (drums), and Dave Amador (guitar), got together in Eugene, Oregon, making their start at garage parties and the U of O beer garden. With compelling lyrics and adept storytelling, their music shifts in mood from the insistent and heavy to the melodic and soulful, comprising the signature sound for which Floater is best known.

&gt; Floater's regional success was noticed by Elemental Records, who put out their first full-length record, ""Sink"" in 1994. That same year Floater began a string of sold out shows at the Community Center for the Performing Arts (The WOW Hall) that is still unbroken to this day.

&gt; In 1995 Floater released ""Glyph"" and toured the country for the next two years supporting the record. The single, ""Danny Boy"" received heavy college and commercial radio play, in many cities outselling major label releases. Floater received nominations to the preliminary level of the Grammy's from NARAS (National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences) in 1995 under Best Rock Performance for ""Sink"" and in 1996 under Best Alternative Performance for ""Glyph."" (Prelims are determined by nominations from the NARAS members).

&gt; In 1998, following their move to Portland, Oregon (where the band currently resides), Floater released their third full-length record, ""Angels in the Flesh and Devils in the Bone."" The second concept album by the band (""Sink"" was the first), ""Angel's"" brought a new vibe to Floater. It wasn't long before widespread audiences came to embrace what has now become the band's trademark - their versatility. 

&gt; September of 2000 brought the release of Floater's fourth full- length record, ""Burning Sosobra""; a musical collection that explores the band's broad range of song writing. Following its release, the band began to perform live acoustically. Both the band and the fans enjoyed this new avenue of performance that allowed the ""quieter"" side of Floater to emerge and be explored. Of late, the band has begun playing shows where acoustic Floater opens for electric Floater - giving a sort of Jekyll and Hyde feel to their performances.

&gt; In 2002 Floater released their most critically acclaimed record to date, ""Alter."" Combining the bands strongest musical elements, ""Alter"" moves fluidly from heavy riffs to lullabies and tells flowing stories of fear, love and above all change.

&gt; August of 2004 - The release of the band's acoustic record, ""Acoustics."" Fans of Floater's electric shows responded with enthusiasm to the band's occasional acoustic performance - with their record label's encouragement, the band put together a uniquely recorded album - one that mimics the sound of their actual performances. Recorded in a studio built in the ballroom of their producers house, the record was made without digital editing and has a fresh, live feeling. 

&gt; Floater is also the name of a late nineties indiepop band from Sheffield, UK. They briefly rename themselves Floater UK before later reforming as Dangerlust. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; The time is now for one of the industry’s best-kept secrets: PJ Morton. The Maroon 5 keyboardist/ backing vocalist makes his major label debut on May 14 with New Orleans, his first album for Young Money Entertainment/Cash Money Records. One listen to Morton’s anticipated project quickly reveals why the multi-talent became a favorite on the indie R&amp;B circuit and an in-demand songwriter/producer and also why the limitless talent will be a game changer for the Lil Wayne-founded Young Money.

&gt; New Orleans marks the Cash Money imprint’s first step toward broadening its already wide appeal, thanks to a hit-making and award-winning roster that includes founder Lil Wayne, Drake and Nicki Minaj. And there’s no better ambassador to musically personify that message than Morton, whose self described “soulful pop” seamlessly spans multiple genres from gospel and R&amp;B/funk to pop and rock.

&gt; “I’ve always pushed boundaries,” says Morton, “but I always remain true to who I am musically. New Orleans is a natural progression of who I am. I can’t explain it except through my music. That proves it better than anything I can say.”

&gt; Building that case is “Only One” featuring Stevie Wonder. Quickly garnering strong reaction following its January premiere on Billboard.com, the song is the lead single from New Orleans. Armed with an infectious hook and a head-boppin’ groove, the up-tempo number showcases Morton’s velvety tenor, songwriting skills and musicianship, accented by Wonder’s distinctive harmonica.

&gt; “Stevie joining me on the track is the ultimate start. It’s my dream come true,” says Morton of teaming with Wonder. “I want to continue the legacy he represents: musicianship and positivity.”

&gt; New Orleans itself stems from Morton’s acclaimed 2012 EP, Following My First Mind, featuring guest cameos from Maroon 5’s Adam Levine, Lil Wayne and Jazmine Sullivan. A nod to Morton’s hometown and musical roots, the forthcoming New Orleans finds Morton at the keyboard playing with a full backing band complete with horns and strings. The result is a lush, melodic yet organic 10-track set that grabs listeners right from the opening title track.

&gt; “New Orleans is where I learned how to play music,” recalls Morton. “It’s the physical and mind space I was in when I fell in love with music. It wasn’t about marketing, radio and publicity. It was just about making music because I loved it. It made me feel good. Young Money wanted me creatively as I am. That’s why I’m excited about this next chapter.”

&gt; Also featuring rapper Busta Rhymes, New Orleans comes packed with a diverse slate of musical influences. There’s the reggae-infused “Hard Enough,” which explores relationship issues. “I’m looking for a love unconditional / Not one that goes wherever the wind blows,” declares Morton as the song opens.

&gt; The self-described “Dr. Love” traverses the same landscape on the mid-tempo “Work It Out.” Set off by a touch of synth and a hypnotic drumbeat, the song once again spotlights Morton’s tantalizing tenor. Also noteworthy is “Heavy,” a song revamped from Morton’s 2012 EP and featuring Adam Levine. Sporting a funk/rock track reminiscent of Sly Stone and Prince, the song’s lyrics were inspired by Morton’s frustration at one point with his indie career.

&gt; “It was at a point where I was trying to figure out what the next step was,” says Morton, who hadn’t yet connected with pop hitmakers Maroon 5. “This was me getting those feelings out. Since that frustration, I’ve had one of the biggest years in my career. It’s crazy.”

&gt; Influenced by acts ranging from the Beatles and James Taylor to Wonder and Donny Hathaway, the New Orleans native is the son of gospel singer Paul S. Morton. His formal foray into the industry was as a member of the band Freestyle Nation, which debuted in the early 2000s. But it was as a songwriter/ producer that Morton left his first indelible impression. He won a Grammy Award for his songwriting/ production of India.Arie’s “Interested” from her 2002 album Voyage to India.

&gt; That opened the door to more collaborations (Jermaine Dupri, LL Cool J, Monica, Musiq Soulchild, Trinitee 5:7) and additional accolades (Dove and Stellar Awards) for his work with gospel singer DeWayne Woods. Woods’ “Let Go, Let God” spent a record 70 weeks on the gospel chart. Along the way, Morton released several acclaimed indie solo albums. He also attracted the attention of Academy Award-winning producer AR Rahman (“Slumdog Millionaire”), who asked Morton to contribute a song (“Sajna”) to the soundtrack for the Vince Vaughn comedy “Couples Retreat.”

&gt; Morton’s next big break occurred three years ago, when he was asked to audition by friend and Maroon
5 music director Adam Blackstone for a spot in the band as its keyboardist/vocalist. Soon after, childhood friend and Young Money Entertainment president Mack Maine championed Morton’s music and vision to Cash Money co-CEO’s Roland “Slim” Williams and Bryan “Birdman” Williams. With Lil Wayne co-signing his approval as well, Morton is ready to bring his journey full circle with New Orleans.

&gt; “My indie years and working with various artists, including Maroon 5, have helped me understand who I am as both an individual and an artist,” says Morton. “It has allowed me to create a fan base that will forever be with me. Now I’m being given the opportunity to do on steroids what I’ve been doing for years.” Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Janelle Monáe is a U.S. singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and performer.

&gt; Monáe was born Janelle Monáe Robinson on 1st December 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas. She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD ""Edgy In Brixton"" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London. The DVD contains a full live performance of the debut album Costello Music, B-Sides from various singles and a new song called Pretty Like a Girl. Extras on the DVD include the band being asked questions by members of The Fratellis' website, and on the deluxe edition, highlights from the T In The Park 2007 festival. It was released in the United States on the 30 October 2007

&gt; 2007-2008: Here We Stand

&gt; On November 20, 2007, it was announced on the Fratellis' official website that work had begun on the second album in rehearsal space in Glasgow. The band stated that they are self-producing the album and have their own studio to record in. Recording finished on January 13, 2008.

&gt; On February 22, 2008, they played a small show for fans at Queen Margaret Union to debut new songs from the upcoming album. About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. The first single from the album was called ""Mistress Mabel"" and was released on May 26, 2008. The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd. The Fratellis released a deluxe edition of Here We Stand internationally on December the 8th. The CD includes a new song titled 'Moriarty's Last Stand' and the accompanying DVD includes ""The Year Of The Thief"" (A documentary of the band on the road in the US); A live show filmed on June 18th 2008 at the Fillmore, San Francisco; performances of Milk and Money, Flathead and Mistress Mabel from Abbey Road Studios and the videos for the singles Mistress Mabel and Look Out Sunshine!
On April, 22 2010, both singer Jon Lawler and bassist Barry Wallace posted messages on their forum saying the band are unlikely to record together again soon.

&gt; The Fratellis have announced during June 2012 that they have decided to reform to help raise money for The Eilidh Brown Memorial Fund on the 15th of June at the MacRobert Centre in Stirling. The band plans on announcing more dates for later in the year.
The band then announced an extensive UK tour during December 2012 to take place in April 2013. During the UK tour, 3 more songs were debuted live; ""She's Not Gone Yet (But She's Leaving), Seven Days and Whiskey Saga.
On February 4th 2013, The Fratellis announced they had finished recording their third album, which was revealed to be called We Need Medicine with a release date of October 7th 2013. ""Seven Nights Seven Days"" was released as a single on September 29th. The album was recorded in Glasgow with Jon Fratelli and Stuart McCredie on production duties.

&gt; On the 24th of April 2013 it was announced that The Fratellis would be headlining Brownstock Festival in Essex on Sunday the 1st of September.

&gt; On the 22nd June 2013 The Fratellis headlined New College Commemoration Ball, a white-tie Ball set in the grounds of New College, Oxford.

&gt; The Beach Bastards were (are) a collaboration between some musicians from various Liverpool ""indie"" bands in the 1980's.
The collaboration was inspired by an idle drunken thought about what a cross between ""The Beach Boys"" and ""The Jesus and Mary Chain"" might sound like. And a very productive day on a Teac 144 Portastudio.
The original session was performed ""deliberately badly"" in an Andy Warhol type philosophy, and in a attempt to impress John Peel.

&gt; The first Gig was a virtually impromptu appearance at The Everyman, on Liverpool's Hope St. Followed shortly after by another at Henley Regatta. Both only done as a joke really and in a slot donated by ""The Lawnmower"" who had been booked to play.
The band only ever aquired a cult following, but were often found supporting some of the major acts of the day. They were the first band ever to play the Manchester Academy (supporting The Buzzcocks)

&gt; Their one and only official release is the Album ""Son of a Beach"" (1989 | DIST001 | Probe Plus Cartel/Disturbocharger Records)

&gt; Mission of Burma is an American post-punk band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1979. The band was formed by Roger Miller (guitar), Clint Conley (bass), Peter Prescott (drums) and Martin Swope (tape manipulator/sound engineer). Miller, Conley and Prescott share singing and songwriting duties. Like many of their post-punk contemporaries, Mission of Burma's efforts are largely concerned with extending punk's original vocabulary without losing its essential rebellious spirit. Using rapid shifts in dynamics, unconventional time signatures and chord progressions along with tape effects, Mission of Burma challenges the prevailing idioms of punk while attempting to retain its power and immediacy.

&gt; In early years the band's audience was limited to the Boston area, with all their recordings released on the small Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. The band released only one album in its original form, Vs.. Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope, and has since recorded two more albums, ONoffON and The Obliterati.

&gt; Their wall-of-noise musical sound extended the vocabulary of punk while continuing to hold clear its sense of power and abandon.  They used a number of tape effects, different chord progressions, and time shifts to highlight their formal training in music.  Not only that but they are seen now as a highly influential band to both post-punk and experimental music to come after; many bands cite Burma as an inspiration, including Nirvana, Superchunk, Creed, The Grifters, R.E.M. (who regularly covered ""Academy Fight Song"" on their Green tour), Sonic Youth, Throwing Muses, Yo La Tengo, Soul Asylum, Pixies, Sugar, Catherine Wheel, Guided by Voices, Graham Coxon and Moby - the last two of which have covered """"That's When I Reach For My Revolver.""

&gt; The band were due to tour in 1980 with Joy Division but the suicide of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's singer, canceled the tour. In 1983, after releasing their only full-length studio record Vs., the group disbanded due to Miller's worsening tinnitus.

&gt; The band found increasing relevance throughout the 90s, culminating in the publication of Michael Azzerad's essays Our Band Could Be Your Life which featured Mission of Burma. In 2002, they reunited and began playing reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and formerly Prescott's Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller relates that ""when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin's position, we told him he could use current digital technology which accomplishes Martin's antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted for maintaining the original integrity, and uses a tape deck.""

&gt; Janelle Monáe is a U.S. singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and performer.

&gt; Monáe was born Janelle Monáe Robinson on 1st December 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas. She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

&gt; British-born Carina Round is a singer-songwriter whom has earned tremendous accolades from fans, critics and the artistic community alike for both her distinctive, yet versatile vocal style and gut wrenchingly honest songwriting.

&gt; Her critically acclaimed performances are nothing short of spectacular. She runs the gamut from “howling siren” to the performer of ethereal confessional tales, disbanding all concepts of musical tags. It is no wonder she has shared stages with an array of diverse artists such as Annie Lennox, Billy Corgan, Maynard James Keenan, Ryan Adams, Elbow, The Gutter Twins, Snow Patrol, Miles Hunt (The Wonder Stuff), Mark Eitzel, and the legendary James Brown. 

&gt; Growing up in Wolverhampton, England, Carina, starting from a very young age, always had an affinity towards music and began to follow her musical dreams. Never losing sight of her goals, her determination and passion led to the recording of her first album The First Blood Mystery (2001). Shaped in the erratic but gripping sounds, her love of legends Patti Smith and Jeff Buckley resonates undeniably. 

&gt; The follow-up and Interscope re-released debut album: The Disconnection (2004) took those influences into much more powerful and personal realms. It landed Carina worldwide exposure in the process, which ultimately brought her career to Los Angeles, California. The relocation proved worthwhile. For Slow Motion Addict (2007), Carina teamed up with notable producer Glen Ballard to create a bewitching and seductive new album. Accompanying the release was a 12-part episodic series that cleverly coincided with each track, creating a visual story for the album. It gave Carina another medium to showcase her artistic ability by acting and starring as the troubled lead character, Maisie Scarlett. 

&gt; Two years later, Carina self-released the EP Things You Should Know in 2009 that resulted in more critical success, having multiple film &amp; TV shows feature her music as well as multiple radio stations, including KCRW, champion her music. Opportunities came flooding in to work with other artists Carina has admired over the years. 

&gt; Since 2009 she is also a member of the band Puscifer, the Solo-Project of Tool- and A Perfect Circle-Vocalist Maynard James Keenan, contributing the female and 2nd voice in live shows and on albums of the band. She also sang vocals on The Twilight Singers new album ‘Dynamite Steps’ along with other artists Nick McCabe (The Verve), Mark Lanegan, and Ani DiFranco, among others. In addition to this, Carina moved into the world of composing and writing for film, working with the award winning film composers John Debney and Glen Ballard on a song that was composed for the film Valentine’s Day, writing with Academy Award winner Marco Beltrami, as well as various others. 

&gt; In one of Carina’s co-writing sessions for film &amp; TV, a band was created called Early Winters with EMI Canadian artist Justin Rutledge, L.A. producer/musician Dan Burns and multi-instrumentalist Zac Rae. The band is an indie rock band with touches of country and folk flare, which draw comparisons to Neko Case and the Swell Season. 

&gt; All of these projects were an inspirational stepping stone for Carina to completing her newest album Tigermending which was released May 1st 2012 through her label Dehisce. On the new track ‘Got To Go (The L.A Song) features Smashing Pumpkins’ front man Billy Corgan playing guitar and she co-wrote the haunting track ‘The Secret of Drowning’ with the legendary Dave Stewart and Brian Eno.

&gt; Comparisons are frequently drawn to PJ Harvey, though Round would contend that she is more directly influenced by Patti Smith.

&gt; Mission of Burma is an American post-punk band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1979. The band was formed by Roger Miller (guitar), Clint Conley (bass), Peter Prescott (drums) and Martin Swope (tape manipulator/sound engineer). Miller, Conley and Prescott share singing and songwriting duties. Like many of their post-punk contemporaries, Mission of Burma's efforts are largely concerned with extending punk's original vocabulary without losing its essential rebellious spirit. Using rapid shifts in dynamics, unconventional time signatures and chord progressions along with tape effects, Mission of Burma challenges the prevailing idioms of punk while attempting to retain its power and immediacy.

&gt; In early years the band's audience was limited to the Boston area, with all their recordings released on the small Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. The band released only one album in its original form, Vs.. Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope, and has since recorded two more albums, ONoffON and The Obliterati.

&gt; Their wall-of-noise musical sound extended the vocabulary of punk while continuing to hold clear its sense of power and abandon.  They used a number of tape effects, different chord progressions, and time shifts to highlight their formal training in music.  Not only that but they are seen now as a highly influential band to both post-punk and experimental music to come after; many bands cite Burma as an inspiration, including Nirvana, Superchunk, Creed, The Grifters, R.E.M. (who regularly covered ""Academy Fight Song"" on their Green tour), Sonic Youth, Throwing Muses, Yo La Tengo, Soul Asylum, Pixies, Sugar, Catherine Wheel, Guided by Voices, Graham Coxon and Moby - the last two of which have covered """"That's When I Reach For My Revolver.""

&gt; The band were due to tour in 1980 with Joy Division but the suicide of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's singer, canceled the tour. In 1983, after releasing their only full-length studio record Vs., the group disbanded due to Miller's worsening tinnitus.

&gt; The band found increasing relevance throughout the 90s, culminating in the publication of Michael Azzerad's essays Our Band Could Be Your Life which featured Mission of Burma. In 2002, they reunited and began playing reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and formerly Prescott's Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller relates that ""when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin's position, we told him he could use current digital technology which accomplishes Martin's antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted for maintaining the original integrity, and uses a tape deck.""

&gt; Emerging from the tragic bankruptcy of Stiff Records, James Taylor, founding member of the infamous group The Prisoners, formed The James Taylor Quartet. JTQ's first single, Blow Up was released on the Re Elect The President (Acid Jazz) label in 1985. It was a huge success, immediately attracting the attention of John Peel who championed it; the track appearing in Peel's annual Festive Fifty chart. After an impressive 13 weeks in the Indie Singles Chart, the band decided to start work on a mini album, titled Mission Impossible. This debut, released in '86, was naturally featured around Taylor's Hammond organ sound to produce classic covers of Sixties film themes, and other heavily grooving instrumental punk funk tunes. With JTQ's following growing, the band were encouraged to put out their second album on Re Elect The President. By the time it was released in '87, the band's attentions were being drawn away from their recording career to their now massive live audience. JTQ's emphasis on live 'dance' music has been the key to the band's success, enabling them to establish a solid relationship between them and their fans.With the focus now strongly on being a 'live' band, The Quartet gigged relentlessly, selling out on the London club circuit. During this period, mjor record company interest was aroused resulting in a long term deal with Polydor. The James Taylor Quartet released three albums on Polydor. A number of hit singles were spawned from these such as the acclaimed and well-loved classic ""Theme From Starsky &amp; Hutch"".With the release of their first live album in 1991, The Quartet moved to Polydor subsidiary Big Life. Featuring guest vocals from Rose Windross of  Soul II Soul and Noel McKoy, the album initiated JTQ's introduction to the Soul Market. In 1992, Noel McKoy officially became the Quartet's lead vocalist. In this year alone, the band performed over one hundred and fifty shows in 15 different countries, including destinations as far flung as Thailand, Japan and the USA. The climax of this was headlining in from of 5,000 people at London's Brixton Academy.

&gt; In 1994, with chart success behind them and their established international live network, The James Taylor Quartet made the decision to go full circle and rejoin Edward Piller at the independent Acid Jazz. The first album from his new home  was received with critical acclaim and is Acid Jazz's current top seller having sold over 200,000 copies - further proof that James Taylor is one of the great Hammond players of this generation. Also released was the retrospective BBC Radio Sessions LP and for the first time James' material was released in the USA via Hollywood records with tracks from being the highest climber in the college radio charts.

&gt; James' 10th album saw a return to the style he loved most - instrumental Hammond led rocking jazz funk workouts. It featured the stripped down to the bone sound that pays respect to the earliest JTQ hits like  and the press respected him for the move away from commercial pop/soul and the now wholly instrumental live set ripped up the crowds more than ever. 1996 saw James play two full sell out weeks at London's Jazz Cafe and a sell out show at The Brixton Academy, as well as tours in uncharted territories from Brazil to Yugoslavia. In 1998 James had the chance to fulfil a dream - film themes always featured heavily throughout his albums and he was asked to score a theme for Austin Powers, a spy spoof starring Mike Myers (Wayne's World). James also set up his own label JTI Records, releasing a compilation album of various artists who he has worked with and respected over the years including Simon Bartholomew (Brand New Heavies), The Prisoners, New Jersey Kings and The Apostles. That year also saw James touring the UK and Europe to support the release of MOBO-nominaa new live album by the band released in May. It also saw James sign to a new label GUT Records, to begin the next phase of the adventure. The autumn of 1999 saw James featuring on the Tom Jones duets album with which they performed together on the National Lottery Show.

I'm actually a member of the Syndicate, Jesse's private Facebook group for the Master Course that he talks about in these videos, and I'm in one of his videos as well.

Jesse's group is really great for people who want to kickstart a career in licensing music.  We have a ton of people in the group with a ton of experience in different sectors of the industry, so we're all learning from each other.  Among us, we have:

* A voting member of the Recording Academy (The people who vote on the Grammys)

* People who have worked with bigger indie labels/artists in the past

* A musical director who composes and arranges for plays and musicals

* Numerous people who currently work in TV/Film licensing, including people who've worked as music supervisors before

I think his course is a really great investment if you really want to learn a lot about the industry and essentially have some ""training wheels"" to getting in with some music libraries.

I'm not a huge Bruno fan, I listen to indie music mostly, but I love hip hop as well. When I was younger though, I'd say the same thing about acts like Bruno. But as you mature in age and especially as a music maker it's easy to see why Bruno won, and his win was as deserved if not more so than artists like Kendrick, who won best rap album so wtf is the problem. I think the Record of the year, &amp; album of the year wins were fair, song of the year coulda been a toss up(Based on what the awards are meant to acknowledge).

Once you learn about what it takes to make an album you have to acknowledge the skill in music composition, arrangement, production, engineering, mixing and performances on the recording, it's clear why Bruno won. All the young people who don't understand the awards are given by the ""Recording Academy of Arts and Sciences"" just whine whenever their favs don't win. Not to say that people have never been robbed cause that's definitely not the case.

I love Kendrick and Damn was amazing and culturally significant as a hip hop album, but it just didn't stand up. Someone mentioned Michael Jackson, Bruno's like MJ talent wise, and so was the production team behind 24k.

t5_2t4it,,,,False,,,,,,,LetsTalkMusic,,,,,,dtf4nz7,,,0,,,,armyhalfday,,,t3_7tqbvn,6,,,,,,"I have 2 guesses:

1. A glut in the music market vs. the film market.  In terms of raw numbers, about ~700 films get theatrical releases each year, but the vast majority of those barely show on any screens and don't get any attention or acclaim.  Movies that get any kind of wide release (regardless of quality) are usually produced by one of the few major studios - the occasional indie production company like A24 breaks through, but that's very much an exception.  If you dwindle that number down even further to only include movies that have received any kind of critical acclaim, you're most likely looking at under 50 films (I am admittedly pulling that number out of my ass).  
Meanwhile, (again don't have the raw numbers but...) *thousands* of albums get released each year, but they're totally decentralized.  There are lots of independent albums released that seem popular to people who are really into music, but there's not really any consensus because usually their popularity is contained among fans of a certain genre.  The only music that has any kind of popular consensus or recognition is pop music, so naturally they're going to gravitate towards that.  Granted, that doesn't explain the ridiculous decisions made within that framework (e.g. Bruno Mars sweeping this year when he was up against Kendrick), but it does explain the general sensibility. 


2. Frankly this one is more likely - lots of great movies feature big stars.  The vast majority of great music comes from absolute nobodies.  The Academy can nominate Meryl Streep and people will be excited to see her, but the Grammys will garner a lot more excitement if they show Ed Sheeran on TV than they would showing Sufjan Stevens.  Networks see that, so of course they're going to nominate whoever will get them the most viewers.",,,,,,,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_7tqbvn,,,,/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/7tqbvn/why_do_you_guys_think_the_grammys_are_more/dtf4nz7/,public,,,,,,1517247142.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1518396574.0,,,

&gt; One eskimO was ‘born’ in 2004 and is the brain child of Kristian Leontiou.  At the time Kristian was at the end of promoting his debut album: Some Day Soon (Polydor) which sold over 200,000 copies. His debut single (Story Of My Life) also went Top 10 in the UK singles chart.  Kris (as he is known to his friends) grew up in the north-west suburbs of London, his first experiences of music coming from his older sisters, who would regularly shake the Leontiou household whilst practicing with their respective punk bands, in their bedrooms! At only 10 years old Kris was mesmerized when sisters Anna and Alex would sneak him in to watch them perform at venues like The Mean Fiddler.  When most kids were getting used to weekend lay-ins, at 14 Kristian had already developed a self survival ‘street’ mentality and had already undertaken work in an array of ‘grown up’ situations that not many so young are exposed to. The resulting attribute is someone very much of his own mind, a humble belief in his own visions creatively. Often he was a child in an adult’s world. It’s no surprise then at only 15, Kristian was introduced to recording studios, adding guest vocals on friend’s garage &amp; dance demos, and using any down time to begin his first explorations musically. His early and lasting influences on these initial compositions were acts like Arrested Development, The Fugees, REM, Groove Armada and Finlay Quay.   Working in various and unsatisfying dead-end jobs after leaving school, Kris went to the studio whenever he had any spare time, hoping it would one day pay off…and eventually it did.  In his late teens Kristian met by chance Mike Sault of Warner Chappell (Dido/Craig David/Groove Armada) who promptly offered a publishing deal. Kris went traveling around the country working with various producers searching for ‘his sound’ Sault eventually paired Kristian with Producer/Song writer Pete Wilkinson (credits include Paolo Nutini &amp; Amy Macdonald) of Melodramatic Records. Together, and with Pete’s wife Sarah, they wrote and produced the Some Day Soon album in Wilkinson’s ‘spare bedroom’ studio’  The initial bedroom demos got a great and instant response from many labels and in late 2002 Kris signed to Polydor (home of Ian Brown and Snow Patrol) within a matter of weeks; Polydor had the album mixed/mastered and promptly started promoting his first single which entered the charts at no. 9. Growing up as a studio based singer, Kristian suddenly found himself on stage for the first time in his life (Islington Academy – 1000+ capacity) performing to what felt like a million people including the press, the music industry, friends, and family. In his own words ""it was the worst performance of my life, I was way too under prepared’ these days it’s a very different story ‘I feel free on stage today’ says Kristian in 2007 ‘I feel I’m meant to be up there, like I belong, back then I felt very nervous and extremely vulnerable’  During a long promotional tour for the Album throughout the UK and Europe Kris was finding it increasingly difficult emotionally ‘I began to feel like I was promoting an album that didn't really represent or ‘belong’ to me. It didn’t say anything about my personality, and musically I longed to sound more like me, whatever that was’  Kristian has always been a free spirit but at that time felt like his life was being micro managed with advice on what he said, wore, did and sang. He craved creative expression but was on a ‘good looking young man’ pop-music treadmill, one that many before him had found a false and a crushing experience.   On a flight back from L.A. in late 2004 Kristian had the flash of light that was the concept and creative birth of One eskimO ‘With absolutely no compromise’ he said ‘I wanted to create a sound of my own, magical, ambient, filmic, acoustic, beautiful and meaningful. I wanted to write about how I felt, life, love, losses &amp; failures, highs and lows, even heartbreaks. But also about how amazing human life is and how mind blowing our very existence is’.  ‘I also had my own visual interpretation of the music, for an animated visual to run alongside the music, telling magical stories with a childlike innocence whilst creating a sonic ‘journey’ for everyone. ‘Even if just for a moment, I want people to hear this and feel like it did before anything mattered in life, when they were truly free, when they were children’  The One eskimO sound was developed in a Battersea studio along side good friend - Craigie Dodds (credits include Sugababes) they took their time working with sounds and beats and soon came up with the song ‘Chocolate’.  ""This song just sums up that period in my life; this was the first proper song and just the right sound for One eskimO!"".  At the same time Kristian teamed up with Adam Falkner – experienced session musician/drummer and unbeknown to him soon to become a giraffe! They started rehearsing a live set, every detail was considered, including what everything would look and sound like for the audiences. With Kristian’s right hand man now on guitar - Martin Waugh (soon to be the penguin in the growing animal line-up) they were also lucky enough to now know Jamie Sefton who was a wizard on bass &amp; horns, he also joined and rather inevitably, become the monkey. The band was formed.   Meanwhile a mutual friend had introduced Kristian to Rollo Armstrong (faithless/dido and many more) Kristian asked Rollo directly and politely to get involved in the album, and a very reluctant Rollo agreed to take a listen to One eskimO demos. Upon hearing the song ‘Astronauts’ he immediately opted in and ended up co-producing the album with Kristian. The team was starting to mirror the vision.   At this time, it became clear that Kristian’s idea of an eskimO world and animated videos didn't really fit with the Polydor vision of a radio friendly ‘Kristian Leontiou’ so they respectfully and amicably parted company.   With the One eskimO demos completed, the band wanted to record the album how any self respecting musicians would, together and completely live. They recorded alongside ‘ark’ (Rollo/Marky Bates/ Grippa) with Phil Brown (credits include Bob Marley) engineering and all had a great time doing it. After a month of recording the band, Kristian went to Rollo’s personal ‘ark’ studios where together they spent a further year experimenting with sounds, textures, and adding lots of magic eskimO dust! 
In 2007 Martin was ‘lost in a snowstorm’ which in reality translates to Mika (who he also played guitar for) shooting to fame. He was promptly replaced by the exceptionally gifted guitarist Pete Rinaldi and what felt like a loss became a huge win ‘Pete makes us complete’ says Kris. Through a series of 'happy accidents"" Kristian met Nathan Erasmus who had just formed Gravy Media, quite literally an ‘independent company’ operating from people’s bedrooms and lounges. Gravy Media was formed with Erasmus’s childhood friend Phil Menni, together and from an early age they both shared an obsessive love for illustration and animation.  It was Nathan’s shared love of the eskimO sound that inspired the intricate visual voyages of family, innocence and magic that became the first One eskimO video. It sits alongside the stunning single ‘Hometime’   

&gt; You now know the eskimO…hello.

&gt; New LP, Broken Devotion, out now!

&gt; Free download of a new Mint Julep track 'Tame': https://soundcloud.com/keithkenniff/mint-julep-tame-free-download

&gt; Other projects by Keith Kenniff: Helios and Goldmund.

&gt; Formed in Boston, Massachusetts, in 2007, Mint Julep is the husband-and-wife team of Hollie and Keith Kenniff. Subsequently relocating to Portland, Oregon, the duo cut a limited release album, Songs About Snow, in 2008 – effectively a trial run for further recording in their home studio, the fruit of which is a sublime follow-up, Save Your Season, released in 2011. The duo self-released Broken Devotion on Unseen in 2015. An ambient album, A Deep and Dreamless Sleep, is slated for release in late 2016.

&gt; Hallmarked by Hollie’s seductive, dreamy vocals and a succession of memorably soaring choruses, all of it etched with Keith’s vivid, glinting keyboards, towering guitars and miscellaneous instrumental hooks, Mint Julep make lustrous modern pop music that is wistful and mellifluous yet simultaneously powerful, even epic – equal parts shoegazing romanticism and cool, Kraftwerkian polish. Their songs seem instantly familiar, like old musical friends, a ’classicism’ offset by the freshness and luminosity they exude as they usher you on a breathless ride through the sunlit uplands of electronic indie-rock.

&gt; Mint Julep was designed as a conscious departure from Keith’s previous, ambient- orientated projects. “When Hollie and I set out to do something, I wanted to find some way to incorporate her vocals into a slightly different style, rather than just write similar material to my solo work and lay her vocals over top”, he says. “I had the need to write something that had some distorted guitars, loud drums and was a little bolder than what I had previously done. We messed around with a track one night (which became ‘Stay’) and it was a fun process, so we just kept writing more songs so we could do a project together.”
Soon a working pattern emerged, with Keith composing music around Hollie’s lyrics or making tracks which Hollie would then add to. “It just developed after a lot of trial and error, and after a while the material started to plateau and began to sound like an album…”

&gt; A Pennsylvannian by birth, Keith Kenniff is an honours graduate of Boston’s esteemed Berklee College of Music, best known as the brains behind dulcet ambient/electronic practitioners Helios and the fingers on the ivories of post-classical piano minimalists Goldmund (the latter’s music once described by no less an authority than Ryuichi Sakamoto as “…so, so, so beautiful…”). A succession of albums under those aliases has made Kenniff the darling of discerning critics and his music has also been widely used in film, television and advertising, not least on the soundtrack to Harmony Korine’s 2007 comedy-drama Mister Lonely and the trailer for the 2009 Academy Award-nominated Revolutionary Road, directed by Sam Mendes.

&gt; Originally from Ohio, singer Hollie Kenniff maintains dual US/Canadian citizenship, having spent part of her life in Ontario. Aside from Mint Julep, she has collaborated on several additional musical endeavors in tandem with husband Keith, including a children’s music project, Meadows, (inspired by the couple’s young son), whose debut longplayer was recently released, and an ambient diversion under their own names.

&gt; Janelle Monáe is a U.S. singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and performer.

&gt; Monáe was born Janelle Monáe Robinson on 1st December 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas. She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

There's plenty of variety in Birmingham in terms of nightlife, pubs in student areas are still pretty reasonable (£2.50-£3.50 a pint), and there's always things going on. It really depends on where you live, if there's loads of students around then you'll have plenty to choose from.

Clubs are pretty much the same, loads of them on Broad Street, from 2500+ guest super clubs to small indie bars, there's loads to choose from! Also lots of smaller gin/cocktail bars if that's your thing!

Finally, the music scene is pretty decent too. The academy has gigs multiple times a week, then there's the National indoor arena and NEC just outside of town for larger bands.

&gt; C Duncan (born Christopher Duncan, 29 July 1989) is a Scottish composer and musician. His debut album, Architect, was nominated for the 2015 Mercury Music Prize.

&gt; The son of two classical musicians, he was surrounded by music throughout his childhood. He initially took up piano and viola. His teens led him to school bands – learning to play guitar, bass and drums – but did little to quell his fascination with the composition and performance of classical music. He eventually enrolled in Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland) to study music composition, where his pieces were performed by various ensembles across the UK.

&gt; To hear C Duncan’s music now is to grasp those two common threads between his interests in classical and modern music. The pieces that make up his forthcoming debut LP are formed from lush choral harmonies and acoustic instrumentation, textured like contemporary dreampop and all recorded at home in Glasgow on his bedroom studio setup, gradually built up one layer and one instrument at a time. The results of this methodical and isolationist recording process give us charming lo-fi folk with the harmonic width of choral composition, the sweetness of barbershop and the rough eloquence that has so readily soundtracked Glasgow over the past decades.

&gt; He is also an accomplished painter, naming Grant Wood and Gerhard Richter as influences. His work has been exhibited throughout Scotland and he provides cover art for his own records, expressing the same musical ideas through painted image. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; The Academy Is... was a rock band which formed in 2003 in Chicago, Illinois, United States. The band's longest lasting lineup consisted of William Beckett (vocals, guitar), Mike Carden (guitar, vocals), Michael Chislett (guitar, keyboards), Adam Siska (bass) and Andy Mrotek (drums). The band released three albums - ""Almost Here"" (2005), ""Santi"" (2007) and ""Fast Times at Barrington High"" (2008) - before disbanding in 2011, several months after Chislett and Mrotek left the band.

&gt; William Beckett (singer) and Adam T. Siska's (bass) plans for starting a band together came to fruition on March 4, 2003 recruiting Mike Carden (guitar) after his former band, Jodie, which had members of Victory Records act June, broke up then eventually adding AJ LaTrace as a lead guitarist and Michael DelPrincipe (Little Mike) as a drummer. They recorded their self-titled debut EP, The Academy (2004), for the Chicago-based label LLR Recordings. LLR Recordings had previously released Beckett's solo project Remember Maine's debut album The Last Place You Look in 2002 and Mike Carden's solo folk album in 2003. The EP was recorded in Villa Park, IL at The Gallery of Carpet by producer Brian Zieske. Pete Wentz from Fall Out Boy heard it and was impressed. The label Fueled by Ramen immediately signed the band.

&gt; In 2004 the band headed to Florida to record their Fueled by Ramen debut Almost Here, produced by James Paul Wisner, who has worked with Dashboard Confessional, Something Corporate, Further Seems Forever, and Underoath. After recording the album and a doing a summer tour, the band underwent a lineup change. Thomas Conrad, formerly of Chicago local band 5o4plan, replaced LaTrace as the second guitarist/backing vocalist and Andy Mrotek, formerly of Last Place Champs, replaced DelPrincipe as the drummer. Andy Mrotek and Thomas Conrad are listed in the liner notes, but were added to the band after the recording of Almost Here to replace DelPrincipe and LaTrace, respectively. They hit the road hard, touring with Fall Out Boy, Something Corporate, Midtown, Matchbook Romance, Motion City Soundtrack and Armor for Sleep. The album was released on February 8, 2005 and the following summer, the band embarked on their first headlining tour alongside Plain White T's, Days Away and June. On Billboard's charts Almost Here peaked at #7 on Top Heatseekers, #16 on Independent Albums, and #185 on The Billboard 200.

&gt; On October 26, 2006, The Academy Is... had announced via the blog on their official website that Thomas Conrad and the band had parted ways. Michael Guy Chislett joined the band to replace Conrad on guitar.

&gt; While touring as a main act on the 2006 Warped Tour, the band began the process of writing songs for their second album. Once finished, the band flew to Los Angeles to record their record with Butch Walker. As of December 23, 2006, the band had officially finished the recording process and the album, entitled Santi, was released April 3, 2007 on the Fueled By Ramen label. The release of this album was listed on Blender's 25 reasons to love 2007. On January 26, 2007 a sample of ""LAX to O'Hare"" was released on the band's AbsolutePunk profile. The album peaked at #32 on the Billboard 200.

&gt; The band went on to release the song ""We've Got a Big Mess on Our Hands"" as the album's first single, before releasing the album on April 3, 2007. Fall Out Boy, +44, Cobra Starship, and Paul Wall all joined the band on the 2007 Honda Civic Tour, after which the band moved on to the ""Sleeping With Giants"" tour with support from The Rocket Summer, Armor for Sleep and Sherwood.

&gt; Life began for Kamasi Washington on February 18, 1981 in Los Angeles, California. In the Washington family music was more of a prerequisite than a privilege. But Kamasi never saw it that way, his love for music began at first sound. His father, Rickey Washington is a professional saxophonist by night and a high school music teacher by day. Kamasi’s mother, Valerie Washington is an accomplished flutist who fell in love with the world of science and became a high school chemistry teacher after her stint as a genetic researcher. By the age of two Kamasi had already began to play the drums and piano, the only thing that kept him away from the wind instruments at that early age was his lack of dental development. He began his exploration into the world of the reeds and brass when he was about seven and his father gave him a clarinet. By the age of twelve Kamasi had found his voice in the form of a tenor saxophone, in fact it was the same saxophone that his father played in high school. 

&gt; Over the next year Kamasi’s development and devotion to music had out grown his academic environment. So he transferred from The Los Angeles Center of Enriched Studies (one the top academic high schools in the nation) and enrolled into the Hamilton High School Music Academy. It was around this time that Kamasi also joined The Multi School Jazz Band (M.S.J.B.), an assembly of the finest young jazz musicians in Los Angeles County and led by Reginald Andrews the same man that taught Kamasi’s father in high school. Because of the sheer vastness of talent that he was surrounded by it was in The Multi School Jazz Band that Kamasi was most inspired during his high school years. Through M.S.J.B. Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi’s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as “The Young Jazz Giants”. 
This fiery group of “Young Giants” wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year “The Young Jazz Giants” had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. 

&gt; After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson’s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album “In My Time” which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi’s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called “Bird Man Records” heard him playing with “The Young Jazz Giants” and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the “big break” for “The Young Jazz Giants” but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after its completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay “ready and waiting” for too long, thus “The Young Jazz Giants” unofficially disbanded. 

&gt; Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called “The Next Step” and that’s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking. 

&gt; (2) Kamasi Washington didn't pick up a saxophone until he was 13 years old, but by that point, he'd been playing several other instruments. That's when he found his calling. Within a couple years, he was the lead tenor saxophonist at Hamilton High School Music Academy in his native Los Angeles. After graduation, he attended UCLA to study ethnomusicology. While enrolled at UCLA, he recorded a self-titled album with Young Jazz Giants, a quartet he had formed with Cameron Graves and brothers Ronald Bruner, Jr. and Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner, released in 2004. From that point, Washington continually performed and recorded with an impressive variety of major artists across several genres, including Snoop Dogg, Raphael Saadiq, Gerald Wilson, McCoy Tyner, George Duke, and PJ Morton. In 2014 alone, Washington demonstrated tremendous range with appearances on Broken Bells' After the Disco, Harvey Mason's Chameleon, Stanley Clarke's Up, and Flying Lotus' You're Dead!, among other albums that covered indie rock, contemporary and progressive jazz, and experimental electronic music. 

&gt;  The following year, Washington contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly and finally debuted as a leader with The Epic, released on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label. An expansive triple album nearly three hours in duration, it involved the other three-quarters of Young Jazz Giants -- by then part of his larger ten piece collective, altnerately known as The Next Step and West Coast Get Down-- string orchestra and choir conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. 

&gt;  The Epic was a critical and commerial success. Not only did it land at number three on the jazz charts, it also found its way on to independent albums and heatseekers charts as well. Washington and his band were not only able to tour the U.S., but to play in Europe and Japan as well. ~ Andy Kellman

&gt; Angela Maria ""Ani"" DiFranco was born on September 23rd, 1970 from parents with Italian and Canadian backgrounds. Both her father, Dante, and her mother, Elisabeth, were architects. She grew up in Buffalo, N.Y. and played her first gigs at the age of nine, playing in local bars in her hometown. She attended the Buffalo Academy for Visual and Performing Arts. She moved to New York City at 16 and in 1988 she made a demo which has become a highly sought-after fan item. She is now a prolific artist.

&gt; Ani’s lyrics focus, amongst other topics, on war, GLBT issues, sexual assault, the music industry and, recently, the joy of motherhood. 
Early on, DiFranco saw how some talents were ignored while others were hyped up. Based on experiences in meeting with the industry she decided to stay independent and as a result she formed her own label: Righteous Babe Records(RBR among her followers). The label was formed in 1989, and a year later her self-titled debut hit the streets. From day one her popularity grew on a mouth to mouth basis. In 1991 her next relase ""Not So Soft"" came out, followed by yearly releases thereafter, with the exception of 2000, when she released only an EP called ""Swing Set"". This EP Includes a cover of Bob Dylan's ""Hurricane"".  
 
Ani tours both with a band and as a solo artist. Her touring pace has often been extreme and in 2005-2006 she had to take a break from touring due to tendonitis. DiFranco's father died early in the summer of 2005; however, she continued her summer tour as a tribute to him. Ani received a Woman of Courage award at the 2006 NOW conference where she also announced that she was pregnant. On January 20th 2007, her daughter Petah Lucia DiFranco Napolitano was born. Ani Difranco gave birth in her home in Buffalo.

&gt; DiFranco has been toasted by the Buffalo News as the ""Buffalo's leading lady of rock music."" The News further said: ""Through the Righteous Babe Foundation, DiFranco has backed various grassroots cultural and political organizations, supporting causes ranging from abortion rights to gay visibility.""

&gt; Since 2003, Ani has been nominated four consecutive times for ""Best Recording package"" at the Grammy awards, one of which she won, in 2003 for ""Evolve.""

&gt; DiFranco's guitar playing is often characterized by a signature staccato style, rapid fingerpicking and use of a plethora of alternate tunings. She delivers many of her lines in a speaking style notable for its rhythmic variation. Her lyrics, which often include alliteration, metaphor, word play and a more or less gentle irony, have also received praise for their sophistication. The song ""Talkin' Mrs. DiFranco Blues,"" by Dan Bern, strings together some of the most memorable lines from DiFranco's early career for comic effects.

&gt; Although DiFranco's music has been classified as both folk rock and alternative rock, she has reached across genres since her earliest albums. DiFranco has collaborated with a wide range of artists including pop musician Prince, folk musician Utah Phillips, funk and soul jazz musician Maceo Parker and rapper Corey Parker. She has used a variety of instruments and styles: brass instrumentation was prevalent in 1998's Little Plastic Castle, strings on the 1997 live album Living in Clip and 2004's Knuckle Down, and electronics and synths in 1999's To the Teeth and DiFranco's latest studio recording, Reprieve.

&gt; DiFranco herself noted that ""folk music is not an acoustic guitar--that's not where the heart of it is. I use the word 'folk' in reference to punk music and rap music. It's an attitude, it's an awareness of one's heritage, and it's a community. It's subcorporate music that gives voice to different communities and their struggle against authority.""

&gt; The combination of personal and political is partially responsible for DiFranco's early popularity among politically active college students, some of whom set up fan pages on the web to document DiFranco's career as early as 1994. Because DiFranco's rapid rise in popularity in the mid-1990s was fueled mostly by personal contact through her many live shows and as said above the word was spread from a fan to their friends and so on rather than mainstream press, fans often expressed a feeling of community with each other.

&gt; DiFranco has expressed political views outside of her music. During the 2000 U.S. presidential election, she encouraged voting for Ralph Nader in non-battleground states. She supported Dennis Kucinich in the 2004 Democratic primaries.

&gt; DiFranco has occasionally joined with Prince in discussing publicly the problems associated with major record companies. DiFranco is openly proud of her label, which employs a number of people in her hometown of Buffalo. In a 1997 open letter to Ms. magazine she expressed displeasure that what she considers a way to ensure her own artistic freedom was seen by others solely in terms of its financial success. Her label has set a standard for other young female singer/song writers.This has not just made her an icon for independent music, but it has also helped establish her as a true feminist which also see the importance of feminism among men. In her poem Reprieve she states that ""feminism ain´t about equality, it´s about reprieve"". 

&gt; DiFranco performed with Cyndi Lauper on ""Sisters of Avalon"", a track from Lauper's 2005 collection The Body Acoustic. She also performed with fellow folk singer Dar Williams on ""Comfortably Numb"", a Pink Floyd cover song from Williams' 2005 album, My Better Self.

&gt; Her most recent work Canon is a career retrospective that gives the listener access to all of her albums through a careful handpicked selection which includes recorded versions of classics such as ""Shameless"", ""Both Hands"" and ""Overlap"" were 3 of the new recorded song versons on Canon. Difranco re-recorded the songs together with Allison Miller on drums and Todd Sickafose on bass.

&gt; Together with Canon, she relased a poetry book with her own painting called ""Verses.""

&gt; Her latest album is called ""Red Letter Year,"" released in late 2008. Just prior to its release, Difranco said the following about the CD: ""I’m really excited. I have a new band I’m working with, and they’re all over it. Actually, there are a lot of people. I have more guests and friends and other artists involved this time around than I have in a long time. It’s fuckin’ sprawling, this record. I’ve been working on it for a while now, taking a little bit more time because I’m on baby time now. My pace is a little bit slower, which I think is great in terms of making records. I think it will benefit the end result"" 

&gt; A new album entitled ""Which Side Are You On?"" was released on January 17, 2012.

&gt; Life began for Kamasi Washington on February 18, 1981 in Los Angeles, California. In the Washington family music was more of a prerequisite than a privilege. But Kamasi never saw it that way, his love for music began at first sound. His father, Rickey Washington is a professional saxophonist by night and a high school music teacher by day. Kamasi’s mother, Valerie Washington is an accomplished flutist who fell in love with the world of science and became a high school chemistry teacher after her stint as a genetic researcher. By the age of two Kamasi had already began to play the drums and piano, the only thing that kept him away from the wind instruments at that early age was his lack of dental development. He began his exploration into the world of the reeds and brass when he was about seven and his father gave him a clarinet. By the age of twelve Kamasi had found his voice in the form of a tenor saxophone, in fact it was the same saxophone that his father played in high school. 

&gt; Over the next year Kamasi’s development and devotion to music had out grown his academic environment. So he transferred from The Los Angeles Center of Enriched Studies (one the top academic high schools in the nation) and enrolled into the Hamilton High School Music Academy. It was around this time that Kamasi also joined The Multi School Jazz Band (M.S.J.B.), an assembly of the finest young jazz musicians in Los Angeles County and led by Reginald Andrews the same man that taught Kamasi’s father in high school. Because of the sheer vastness of talent that he was surrounded by it was in The Multi School Jazz Band that Kamasi was most inspired during his high school years. Through M.S.J.B. Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi’s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as “The Young Jazz Giants”. 
This fiery group of “Young Giants” wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year “The Young Jazz Giants” had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. 

&gt; After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson’s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album “In My Time” which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi’s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called “Bird Man Records” heard him playing with “The Young Jazz Giants” and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the “big break” for “The Young Jazz Giants” but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after its completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay “ready and waiting” for too long, thus “The Young Jazz Giants” unofficially disbanded. 

&gt; Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called “The Next Step” and that’s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking. 

&gt; (2) Kamasi Washington didn't pick up a saxophone until he was 13 years old, but by that point, he'd been playing several other instruments. That's when he found his calling. Within a couple years, he was the lead tenor saxophonist at Hamilton High School Music Academy in his native Los Angeles. After graduation, he attended UCLA to study ethnomusicology. While enrolled at UCLA, he recorded a self-titled album with Young Jazz Giants, a quartet he had formed with Cameron Graves and brothers Ronald Bruner, Jr. and Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner, released in 2004. From that point, Washington continually performed and recorded with an impressive variety of major artists across several genres, including Snoop Dogg, Raphael Saadiq, Gerald Wilson, McCoy Tyner, George Duke, and PJ Morton. In 2014 alone, Washington demonstrated tremendous range with appearances on Broken Bells' After the Disco, Harvey Mason's Chameleon, Stanley Clarke's Up, and Flying Lotus' You're Dead!, among other albums that covered indie rock, contemporary and progressive jazz, and experimental electronic music. 

&gt;  The following year, Washington contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly and finally debuted as a leader with The Epic, released on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label. An expansive triple album nearly three hours in duration, it involved the other three-quarters of Young Jazz Giants -- by then part of his larger ten piece collective, altnerately known as The Next Step and West Coast Get Down-- string orchestra and choir conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. 

&gt;  The Epic was a critical and commerial success. Not only did it land at number three on the jazz charts, it also found its way on to independent albums and heatseekers charts as well. Washington and his band were not only able to tour the U.S., but to play in Europe and Japan as well. ~ Andy Kellman

&gt; On November 20, 2007, it was announced on the Fratellis' official website that work had begun on the second album in rehearsal space in Glasgow. The band stated that they are self-producing the album and have their own studio to record in. Recording finished on January 13, 2008.

&gt; On February 22, 2008, they played a small show for fans at Queen Margaret Union to debut new songs from the upcoming album. About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. The first single from the album was called ""Mistress Mabel"" and was released on May 26, 2008. The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd. The Fratellis released a deluxe edition of Here We Stand internationally on December the 8th. The CD includes a new song titled 'Moriarty's Last Stand' and the accompanying DVD includes ""The Year Of The Thief"" (A documentary of the band on the road in the US); A live show filmed on June 18th 2008 at the Fillmore, San Francisco; performances of Milk and Money, Flathead and Mistress Mabel from Abbey Road Studios and the videos for the singles Mistress Mabel and Look Out Sunshine!
On April, 22 2010, both singer Jon Lawler and bassist Barry Wallace posted messages on their forum saying the band are unlikely to record together again soon.

&gt; The Fratellis have announced during June 2012 that they have decided to reform to help raise money for The Eilidh Brown Memorial Fund on the 15th of June at the MacRobert Centre in Stirling. The band plans on announcing more dates for later in the year.
The band then announced an extensive UK tour during December 2012 to take place in April 2013. During the UK tour, 3 more songs were debuted live; ""She's Not Gone Yet (But She's Leaving), Seven Days and Whiskey Saga.
On February 4th 2013, The Fratellis announced they had finished recording their third album, which was revealed to be called We Need Medicine with a release date of October 7th 2013.

&gt; On the 24th of April 2013 it was announced that The Fratellis would be headlining Brownstock Festival in Essex on Sunday the 1st of September.

&gt; On the 22nd June 2013 The Fratellis headlined New College Commemoration Ball, a white-tie Ball set in the grounds of New College, Oxford.

&gt; Floater began in 1993 when Robert Wynia (lead vocals, bass), Peter Cornett (drums), and Dave Amador (guitar), got together in Eugene, Oregon, making their start at garage parties and the U of O beer garden. With compelling lyrics and adept storytelling, their music shifts in mood from the insistent and heavy to the melodic and soulful, comprising the signature sound for which Floater is best known.

&gt; Floater's regional success was noticed by Elemental Records, who put out their first full-length record, ""Sink"" in 1994. That same year Floater began a string of sold out shows at the Community Center for the Performing Arts (The WOW Hall) that is still unbroken to this day.

&gt; In 1995 Floater released ""Glyph"" and toured the country for the next two years supporting the record. The single, ""Danny Boy"" received heavy college and commercial radio play, in many cities outselling major label releases. Floater received nominations to the preliminary level of the Grammy's from NARAS (National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences) in 1995 under Best Rock Performance for ""Sink"" and in 1996 under Best Alternative Performance for ""Glyph."" (Prelims are determined by nominations from the NARAS members).

&gt; In 1998, following their move to Portland, Oregon (where the band currently resides), Floater released their third full-length record, ""Angels in the Flesh and Devils in the Bone."" The second concept album by the band (""Sink"" was the first), ""Angel's"" brought a new vibe to Floater. It wasn't long before widespread audiences came to embrace what has now become the band's trademark - their versatility. 

&gt; September of 2000 brought the release of Floater's fourth full- length record, ""Burning Sosobra""; a musical collection that explores the band's broad range of song writing. Following its release, the band began to perform live acoustically. Both the band and the fans enjoyed this new avenue of performance that allowed the ""quieter"" side of Floater to emerge and be explored. Of late, the band has begun playing shows where acoustic Floater opens for electric Floater - giving a sort of Jekyll and Hyde feel to their performances.

&gt; In 2002 Floater released their most critically acclaimed record to date, ""Alter."" Combining the bands strongest musical elements, ""Alter"" moves fluidly from heavy riffs to lullabies and tells flowing stories of fear, love and above all change.

&gt; August of 2004 - The release of the band's acoustic record, ""Acoustics."" Fans of Floater's electric shows responded with enthusiasm to the band's occasional acoustic performance - with their record label's encouragement, the band put together a uniquely recorded album - one that mimics the sound of their actual performances. Recorded in a studio built in the ballroom of their producers house, the record was made without digital editing and has a fresh, live feeling. 

&gt; Floater is also the name of a late nineties indiepop band from Sheffield, UK. They briefly rename themselves Floater UK before later reforming as Dangerlust. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Janelle Monáe is a U.S. singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and performer.

&gt; Monáe was born Janelle Monáe Robinson on 1st December 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas. She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

&gt; Rebekka Karijord was born in 1976, in Northern Norway (Lofoten). She lived with her mother during her whole childhood. She moved to new places 17 times before she had her 18.th birthday. Both her parents are artists. 

&gt; Rebekka went to several musical/performance educations such as the Norwegian Musical Theatre, Academy of ballet and she also went to the Royal Academy of Acting in Stockholm. She has a Swedish family and after four years living in Stockholm she feels she has two homes, one in Sweden &amp; one in Norway. 

&gt; During her Theatre education she did a musical-dramatic monologue named ""Rebekkas Saga"", which contained of Bows, Percussion complemented with her music and text. This performance was performed 30 times in Oslo and in Stockholm. The performance became very successful and will be released as a drama-book in Aprii 2004 through Damm Publishing. 

&gt; Rebekka composed her first song when she was 3 years old, recorded her first demo with her own songs when she was 8 years old. She also learned how to play piano and the violin during her whole growth. She started composing English songs when she was 12 years old and contributed with her talent to Children's records and NRK (Norwegian TV) as vocalist, songwriter and actress during her whole growth. 

&gt; When she was 17 years old she was contracted to a major record company, but left out as they tried to control her artistic visions. She immediately procured her own computer to start composing digitally, on her own. She loves her computer, with her own words ""I would claim I have a intimate relationship with my computer"". Rebekka's music is probably inspired by Northern Norway, more specially Lofoten, where her family lives these days. Her dream would be living in Lofoten with her computers, microphones and just keep creating these beautiful tunes. 

&gt; Rebekka wanted her debut album to be like a substantial explosion, where she used a lot of different elements such as electronica, bows, vocals and violins and she definitely explored these to its apex. The result of this adventure became a playful, storylike, dramatic pop-based form, where the vocal expressions and the stories are well represented. The dialectics between the synthetic (computer) and the organic (Vocals) resulted in a powerful but still vulnerable strength that she loves.

&gt; Rebekka never intended to only sing beautifully, she wanted to project a story with her voice. She wants people to listen to the recording and understand what she went through earlier the same day. She's fascinated by Nordic vocal-techniques, joiks in a modern wrapping. Her vision is to touch the pretension to find the real expression. She's tired of her generations' coward irony.

&gt; To this date, she has released three studio albums, all under slightly different artist names:
2003: Neophyte (as Rebekka)
2005: Good or Goodbye with Peder Kjellsby (as Rebekka &amp; The Mysterybox)
2009: The Noble Art Of Letting Go (as Rebekka Karijord)

t5_2szp0,,,,1507025705,,,,,,,TrueFilm,,,,,,dnu9ogq,,,0,,,,GinsbergsPeacock,,,t1_dnsxbg0,4,,,,,,"Okay, let me see if I can math this:

First, I'm only accounting for the minimum to see most of the *annual releases*; prior releases represent an indeterminably large backlog that are more appropriately represented as some extra number beyond keeping up with the times. I'm also assuming that even though some films won't become available until the following year, on average this number will be constant and the carryovers will essentially cancel each other out. I'm ignoring documentaries and short films because that just opens things up exponentially and I'm aiming for a conservative estimate. And, finally, I'm going to take a somewhat Anglo-centric view because we *do* dominate the entertainment market and this estimate will mostly apply to English speakers attempting to maintain a basic level of worldliness. ROUGH ESTIMATES guys, don't shit all over what is already pretty shitty.

Okay, so if we categorize films based on genre, we can estimate roughly how many are exceptional enough to necessitate watching:

1. Action blockbusters - 1 or 2. Typically, not even that much, but there are occasionally some good mid-budget action flicks, and at very least you want to keep informed of Hollywood's baseline.

2. Animated films - Maybe 1. People will generally disagree on which children's film is better, but if you can set aside naive wonder and the Pixar formula there is actually a pretty consistent record of *one* film striking a nice balance between visual flair and thematic depth. And no, last year's one film was *not* *Zootopia*.

3. Indie horror - 2. The genre has really been growing with the resurgence in allegorical horror and commercialization of decent tech. It's not uncommon to see more than one great film in this genre every year.

4. Comedian vehicles - 0. I haven't seen a ""necessary"" star-driven comedy happen in years.

5. Dramedian vehicles - 2 or 3. I'd say that there are usually a couple performances by actors that are worth seeing *despite* their films having little else to offer. These aren't necessarily those that win but are frequently nominated or buzzed about.

6. Tech films - 1. Ignoring action and prestige, there's usually at least one film which, although a technical marvel, doesn't really have anything else going for it.

7. Amazon/Netflix - 3. Both companies are taking advantage of hostage audiences and trying some weird stuff. Amazon is mostly dominating this category, but I still think most of the stuff they put out is of questionable quality.

8. Budgeted prestige films/biopics - 10. This number is probably a little conservative, but not by much. Generally, I find that for every conventional film the academy nominates, I can note a better mid-
 to big-budget film--and usually not much more before we start regressing into formulaic culture hero/slice of life screenplays and Glassian non-scores.

9. Arthouse/indie films - 87. This is going off the average number of films shown at Sundance (77), calculating roughly half are worth watching (37), and then similarly presuming half of that is worth watching at slightly less prestigious festivals like Telluride, South by Southwest, Tribeca, Raindance, and Zero (16*5 = 80). There is some overlap between the films showing at these festivals, and I'm putting that overlap toward accounting for the smaller film festivals (117 total). I'm then going to generously knock off a quarter of that because oftentimes not everything gets a sufficiently wide release, and even then it is frequently difficult to locate these films.

10. European films - 25. Europe remains a pioneer in filmmaking, and even though we're quickly reaching the limits of small-concept filmmaking, there are still boatloads of talented directors here *and* they tend to be a lot more accessible stateside than Asian films. It looks like between Cannes, Berlin, and Venice, they show roughly 100 films between them. Assuming half are good, and only half are accessible in the states, that leaves 25.

11. Asian films - 10. We know that there are several extremely talented directors who consistently put out stuff. You could up this more if you were into genre films like anime or Bollywood, but I think this is the bare minimum to keep up with the state of the art in Asia. Also, the language and trade barriers just make it harder for anything outside of Korea and Japan to make the trip overseas.

12. Middle Eastern films - 1. I wish I could put more here but I haven't seen much diversity of subject material and it's still a comparatively new and niche part of the film community.

13. Panafrican films - 0. Film exists, obviously, but the likelihood that even one film will be both impactful and accessible in the states is generally less than 50%.

14. Misc. films - 2. Anything which defies the above categories, be it a music video anthology, a fan edit, a YouTube video, etc.

Okay, so now we come to our grand total. Using the lowest estimates in each category, I calculate that the average cinephile needs to watch, as an average, conservative minimum, **145** films a year to a) stay on top of all the major film festivals and awards, while b) cutting out the more pedestrian works, c) ignoring any specific genre interests, and d) accounting for accessibility.

That means, on average, watching 3 films a week. Which is actually pretty reasonable, especially if you're a weekend watcher. The problem is that it assumes an impossibly high level of efficiency, and almost no guilty fun or, as I noted previously, watching anything older than a year. It also presumes more value in watching ""good"" or ""exemplary"" films of the year than limiting your watchlist to *only* ""great"" films, which I do agree with you probably ranges closer from 5-25 for most people, depending on how they qualify ""great.""

I still think that about 150 films is a fair estimate if the goal is to locate those ""great"" 15 films, and you're attempting to sift through thousands of films every year ranging from mediocre to terrible. I'd say, with enough due diligence, it's reasonable to hit a masterpiece with a 10% accuracy rate.

EDIT: Btw, I've watched about 500 films since this time last year. Only 15 have come out in 2017, and of those I've only liked 2 and am still waiting for something great. For contrast, I've only seen 66 from 2016, liked about 20, and thought only 2 were great. And for 2015 (which by now I ought to be finished with in a perfect annual model), I've seen 67, liked about 20, thought 7 were great. So, realistically, for all but the consummate hobbyists and professionals, I think my estimate sets expectations far too high for the casual cinephile (although the 10% hit rate seems to loosely hold). Really, if anything, I think this exercise kind of shows that it's nearly impossible for critics and fans to be well-versed in *every* aspect of cinema--by necessity you need at least 500-1000 films (several years) just to know the basics, and *then* need to be watching at least a couple films a week just to gain expertise in a particular region or genre.",,,,,,,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_73syjr,,,,/r/TrueFilm/comments/73syjr/its_your_fun_fancy_free_discussion_october_02_2017/dnu9ogq/,,,,,"simple, miserable, solid all the way through",,1507024060.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1509261531.0,,,

&gt; Thurston Joseph Moore (born July 25, 1958) is an American musician best known as a singer, songwriter and guitarist of Sonic Youth. He has also participated in many solo and group collaborations outside of Sonic Youth, as well as running the Ecstatic Peace! record label. 
In 2012, Moore started a new band Chelsea Light Moving, with their first track, ""Burroughs"", released as a free download. Chelsea Light Moving's eponymous debut was released on 5 March 2013.

&gt; Moore was ranked 34th in Rolling Stone's 2004 edition of the ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time."" In May 2012, Spin published a staff-selected top 100 ranking Moore and his Sonic Youth bandmate Lee Ranaldo together on number 1.

&gt; Moore was born in Coral Gables, Florida and was raised in Bethel, Connecticut. Although he enrolled at Western Connecticut State University, he opted to move to New York City instead. There he learned to play guitar from Glenn Branca and soon co-founded Sonic Youth, serving as the band's guitarist and lead vocalist.

&gt; In 1985, he married Sonic Youth bassist, guitarist and vocalist Kim Gordon, with whom he has a daughter, Coco Hayley Gordon Moore. Thurston is known for playing Fender Jazzmaster guitars along with a host of other Fender models like the Mustang and Jaguar. Thurston is also very well known for being very harsh on his guitars.

&gt; In addition to his work with Sonic Youth, Moore has also released albums as a solo artist, one under the moniker David Adelmen, including 1995's ""Psychic Hearts"". He has collaborated with scores of artists, including My Cat is an Alien, DJ Spooky, Nels Cline, William Hooker, Christian Marclay, Loren Mazzacane Connors, R.E.M. and Cock E.S.P. In the mid-90's Moore formed a side band, The Dim Stars, with punk legend Richard Hell of Richard Hell and the Voidoids. In 2004, Moore performed in and produced an album for the all-star noise band To Live and Shave in L.A., the lineup of which also features Andrew W.K..

&gt; In 2004 Rolling Stone ranked him and Lee Ranaldo, of Sonic Youth, the 33rd and 34th best guitarists of all time. Their playing style is very innovative and they both use a large variety of extended techniques, like for instance their 3rd Bridge screwdriver technique.

&gt; Outside of his work as musical performer Moore runs the independent record label Ecstatic Peace and reviews new music in Arthur Magazine. In May 2005, he released the book Mix Tape: The Art of Cassette Culture.

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD ""Edgy In Brixton"" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London. The DVD contains a full live performance of the debut album Costello Music, B-Sides from various singles and a new song called Pretty Like a Girl.

It was released in the United States on the 30 October 2007

&gt; 2007-2008: Here We Stand

About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. The first single from the album was called ""Mistress Mabel"" and was released on May 26, 2008. The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd.

&gt; Anya Marina is a singer-songwriter and radio disc jockey based in San Diego, Calif. Her music has been featured on the ABC television drama Grey's Anatomy (and its second soundtrack) and on shows such as MTV's The Real World. She is also track 6 on New Moon soundtrack. Anya is a former deejay on KBZT (FM94/9) in San Diego.

&gt; Anya was born in Ann Arbor, Mich., and grew up in the Silicon Valley area of California as a capricious child with Russian-Agnostic/Irish-Catholic professor parents (psychology and russian literature/math) and a younger sister. After finishing high school, Anya moved to Los Angeles as an aspiring actress. With stints in the British American Drama Academy (taught by Richard Dreyfuss, Marsha Mason, Anne Jackson and Eli Wallach) and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Pasadena, Anya has also acted in television and film (in 2001, she starred in the feature film, 100 Girls). She eventually moved back home to earn a college degree in English and writing at Santa Clara University. She continued to struggle as an artist -- working in acting, musical theatre, music, improv and comedy -- but eventually found a job as a radio DJ on KSCU, Santa Clara University's college station.

&gt; After graduating, Anya took a radio station job in San Diego with Mike Halloran at XHRM-FM (92.5). After the station was bought out by another corporation, Halloran hired Anya at Y107 in Los Angeles before they both moved to Premium Radio 92/1 in San Diego's North County. After leaving that station, both disc jockeys landed at FM94/9.

&gt; It was in San Diego that Anya played her first open mic night and began to write her own songs. She quickly developed a live stage act using what she learned as an actress, comic and impressionist. Her recorded debut was a five-song EP called Exercises in Racketeering, which eventually led to a full-length album, Miss Halfway, which was released in early 2005. Anya subsequently opened for such artists as Jason Mraz and Rhett Miller. She was named one of the ""Best Unsigned"" acts by San Diego CityBeat.

&gt; The songs on Miss Halfway talk about her upbringing, ex-boyfriends and all the after-effects. Anya's album was also produced by Scott Russo, the frontman for rockers Unwritten Law, along with Peter King from The Surfers. The record eventually earned a San Diego Music Award for Best Recording. The title track also landed on Grey's Anatomy and was featured as the fifth song on the second Grey's Anatomy (soundtrack) disc along with The Fray, KT Tunstall, Gomez and Snow Patrol.

&gt; The internet radio station KGRL featured her as their Flower-Powered Artist for March of 2007. The feature includes an exclusive interview, CD Review of Miss Halfway, and an on-demand audio stream of an unreleased Anya Marina track titled ""Try It And Like It."" Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Angela Maria ""Ani"" DiFranco was born on September 23rd, 1970 from parents with Italian and Canadian backgrounds. Both her father, Dante, and her mother, Elisabeth, were architects. She grew up in Buffalo, N.Y. and played her first gigs at the age of nine, playing in local bars in her hometown. She attended the Buffalo Academy for Visual and Performing Arts. She moved to New York City at 16 and in 1988 she made a demo which has become a highly sought-after fan item. She is now a prolific artist.

&gt; Ani’s lyrics focus, amongst other topics, on war, GLBT issues, sexual assault, the music industry and, recently, the joy of motherhood. 
Early on, DiFranco saw how some talents were ignored while others were hyped up. Based on experiences in meeting with the industry she decided to stay independent and as a result she formed her own label: Righteous Babe Records(RBR among her followers). The label was formed in 1989, and a year later her self-titled debut hit the streets. From day one her popularity grew on a mouth to mouth basis. In 1991 her next relase ""Not So Soft"" came out, followed by yearly releases thereafter, with the exception of 2000, when she released only an EP called ""Swing Set"". This EP Includes a cover of Bob Dylan's ""Hurricane"".  
 
Ani tours both with a band and as a solo artist. Her touring pace has often been extreme and in 2005-2006 she had to take a break from touring due to tendonitis. DiFranco's father died early in the summer of 2005; however, she continued her summer tour as a tribute to him. Ani received a Woman of Courage award at the 2006 NOW conference where she also announced that she was pregnant. On January 20th 2007, her daughter Petah Lucia DiFranco Napolitano was born. Ani Difranco gave birth in her home in Buffalo.

&gt; DiFranco has been toasted by the Buffalo News as the ""Buffalo's leading lady of rock music."" The News further said: ""Through the Righteous Babe Foundation, DiFranco has backed various grassroots cultural and political organizations, supporting causes ranging from abortion rights to gay visibility.""

&gt; Since 2003, Ani has been nominated four consecutive times for ""Best Recording package"" at the Grammy awards, one of which she won, in 2003 for ""Evolve.""

&gt; DiFranco's guitar playing is often characterized by a signature staccato style, rapid fingerpicking and use of a plethora of alternate tunings. She delivers many of her lines in a speaking style notable for its rhythmic variation. Her lyrics, which often include alliteration, metaphor, word play and a more or less gentle irony, have also received praise for their sophistication. The song ""Talkin' Mrs. DiFranco Blues,"" by Dan Bern, strings together some of the most memorable lines from DiFranco's early career for comic effects.

&gt; Although DiFranco's music has been classified as both folk rock and alternative rock, she has reached across genres since her earliest albums. DiFranco has collaborated with a wide range of artists including pop musician Prince, folk musician Utah Phillips, funk and soul jazz musician Maceo Parker and rapper Corey Parker. She has used a variety of instruments and styles: brass instrumentation was prevalent in 1998's Little Plastic Castle, strings on the 1997 live album Living in Clip and 2004's Knuckle Down, and electronics and synths in 1999's To the Teeth and DiFranco's latest studio recording, Reprieve.

&gt; DiFranco herself noted that ""folk music is not an acoustic guitar--that's not where the heart of it is. I use the word 'folk' in reference to punk music and rap music. It's an attitude, it's an awareness of one's heritage, and it's a community. It's subcorporate music that gives voice to different communities and their struggle against authority.""

&gt; The combination of personal and political is partially responsible for DiFranco's early popularity among politically active college students, some of whom set up fan pages on the web to document DiFranco's career as early as 1994. Because DiFranco's rapid rise in popularity in the mid-1990s was fueled mostly by personal contact through her many live shows and as said above the word was spread from a fan to their friends and so on rather than mainstream press, fans often expressed a feeling of community with each other.

&gt; DiFranco has expressed political views outside of her music. During the 2000 U.S. presidential election, she encouraged voting for Ralph Nader in non-battleground states. She supported Dennis Kucinich in the 2004 Democratic primaries.

&gt; DiFranco has occasionally joined with Prince in discussing publicly the problems associated with major record companies. DiFranco is openly proud of her label, which employs a number of people in her hometown of Buffalo. In a 1997 open letter to Ms. magazine she expressed displeasure that what she considers a way to ensure her own artistic freedom was seen by others solely in terms of its financial success. Her label has set a standard for other young female singer/song writers.This has not just made her an icon for independent music, but it has also helped establish her as a true feminist which also see the importance of feminism among men. In her poem Reprieve she states that ""feminism ain´t about equality, it´s about reprieve"". 

&gt; DiFranco performed with Cyndi Lauper on ""Sisters of Avalon"", a track from Lauper's 2005 collection The Body Acoustic. She also performed with fellow folk singer Dar Williams on ""Comfortably Numb"", a Pink Floyd cover song from Williams' 2005 album, My Better Self.

&gt; Her most recent work Canon is a career retrospective that gives the listener access to all of her albums through a careful handpicked selection which includes recorded versions of classics such as ""Shameless"", ""Both Hands"" and ""Overlap"" were 3 of the new recorded song versons on Canon. Difranco re-recorded the songs together with Allison Miller on drums and Todd Sickafose on bass.

&gt; Together with Canon, she relased a poetry book with her own painting called ""Verses.""

&gt; Her latest album is called ""Red Letter Year,"" released in late 2008. Just prior to its release, Difranco said the following about the CD: ""I’m really excited. I have a new band I’m working with, and they’re all over it. Actually, there are a lot of people. I have more guests and friends and other artists involved this time around than I have in a long time. It’s fuckin’ sprawling, this record. I’ve been working on it for a while now, taking a little bit more time because I’m on baby time now. My pace is a little bit slower, which I think is great in terms of making records. I think it will benefit the end result"" 

&gt; A new album entitled ""Which Side Are You On?"" was released on January 17, 2012.

Wiz Khalifa was everyones favorite rapper in college with Kush &amp; Orange Juice. He was also one of the biggest independent rappers at the time way before Chance The Rapper came along. Wiz has evolved over the years while keeping to the Taylor Gang sound and being a great performer. 

It’s hard not to love an original: the first of many to follow. This notion lends attribution to the world’s adoration with Wiz Khalifa. Born Cameron Jibril Thomaz, Wiz Khalifa is more than a mere M.C. He is a movement and maverick. Four years ago, he simultaneously gave blue collar Americans, as well as his native town of Pittsburgh, a Hip-Hop champion with his #1 mega-hit “Black &amp; Yellow,” a nod to his city’s colors. When rap marketing was primarily focused on street and nightclub promotions, an unsigned yet clairvoyant Wiz decided to share his sinsemilla-scented indie music with an overlooked demo of suburban and collegiate youth. Rap touring mined newer soil and conceived was the soundtrack for a new generation of free-spirited young hippies––fans as well as up-and-coming MCs. “No matter what changes, you’re always gonna want that original feeling,” says Wiz. “Nothing really comes in the way of that. You can’t really fight it.”
“NO MATTER WHAT CHANGES, YOU’RE ALWAYS GONNA WANT THAT ORIGINAL FEELING,” SAYS WIZ. “NOTHING REALLY COMES IN THE WAY OF THAT. YOU CAN’T REALLY FIGHT IT.”
Over the last five years, many rappers have latched onto the Wiz Khalifa wave, but while they’ve mostly kept their head above water, Khalifa has soared on both indie and major plains. Before signing his second deal with Atlantic in 2010, Wiz had already amassed a respectable following, fortune and awareness. He was selling out his own 20-city tours, including the Deal Or No Deal tour and Khalifa was being crowned “Rookie of the Year” by top media brands, including The Source Magazine, XXL Magazine, BET and MTV. His mixtapes penetrated the culture not only musically, but also digitally, with 2010’s free download Kush and Orange Juice hashtag becoming #1 on Twitter and was #1 trend search on Google. In 2010, when the reincarnation of Snoop Dogg declined an offer to join the tour of a heralded rookie named Drake, the decision made as much sense as it did dollars. Instead, the PA product took his new Atlantic deal and the triple platinum Stargate produced “Black &amp; Yellow” smash and commenced his own 50-city run entitled the Waken Baken Tour.
Wiz’s Rostrum/Atlantic Records debut Rolling Papers and follow-up ONIF both burned their way into the cultural conscience from atop the Billboard charts, reaching 197,000 and 148,000 in the first weeks, as well as producing street and commercial hits, including “On My Level” feat. Too Short and “Work Hard, Play Hard.” Each year that followed his debut release, Khalifa would appear on Forbes lists and in Grammy Award categories. Solo artist success allowed the lanky MC to spread his label owner wings. In 2011, he tapped Juicy J from the Academy Award winning legendary rap group Three Six Mafia, to be co-CEO of his Taylor Gang Records. The imprint would introduce audiences to new acts including Chevy Woods and Ty Dollar $ign. Though King Khalifa quickly became a pop darling, the music industry wasn’t alone in recognizing his enterprising mind and market magnetism, which is why the Taylor Gang boss’s recent collaboration with Converse’s Chuck Taylor line is symbiotic perfection (it’s hard not to love an original). “When I find that the other ways I express myself are as interesting as my music it opens up doors and makes things more interesting for me.”",,,,,,False,,True,,,,,False,,True,t3_6ywagn,,,,,,,,,,,1504892701.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1506605343.0,,,

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD ""Edgy In Brixton"" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London. The DVD contains a full live performance of the debut album Costello Music, B-Sides from various singles and a new song called Pretty Like a Girl. Extras on the DVD include the band being asked questions by members of The Fratellis' website, and on the deluxe edition, highlights from the T In The Park 2007 festival. It was released in the United States on the 30 October 2007

&gt; 2007-2008: Here We Stand

&gt; On November 20, 2007, it was announced on the Fratellis' official website that work had begun on the second album in rehearsal space in Glasgow. The band stated that they are self-producing the album and have their own studio to record in. Recording finished on January 13, 2008.

&gt; On February 22, 2008, they played a small show for fans at Queen Margaret Union to debut new songs from the upcoming album. About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. The first single from the album was called ""Mistress Mabel"" and was released on May 26, 2008. The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd.

&gt; Floater began in 1993 when Robert Wynia (lead vocals, bass), Peter Cornett (drums), and Dave Amador (guitar), got together in Eugene, Oregon, making their start at garage parties and the U of O beer garden. With compelling lyrics and adept storytelling, their music shifts in mood from the insistent and heavy to the melodic and soulful, comprising the signature sound for which Floater is best known.

&gt; Floater's regional success was noticed by Elemental Records, who put out their first full-length record, ""Sink"" in 1994. That same year Floater began a string of sold out shows at the Community Center for the Performing Arts (The WOW Hall) that is still unbroken to this day.

&gt; In 1995 Floater released ""Glyph"" and toured the country for the next two years supporting the record. The single, ""Danny Boy"" received heavy college and commercial radio play, in many cities outselling major label releases. Floater received nominations to the preliminary level of the Grammy's from NARAS (National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences) in 1995 under Best Rock Performance for ""Sink"" and in 1996 under Best Alternative Performance for ""Glyph."" (Prelims are determined by nominations from the NARAS members).

&gt; In 1998, following their move to Portland, Oregon (where the band currently resides), Floater released their third full-length record, ""Angels in the Flesh and Devils in the Bone."" The second concept album by the band (""Sink"" was the first), ""Angel's"" brought a new vibe to Floater. It wasn't long before widespread audiences came to embrace what has now become the band's trademark - their versatility. 

&gt; September of 2000 brought the release of Floater's fourth full- length record, ""Burning Sosobra""; a musical collection that explores the band's broad range of song writing. Following its release, the band began to perform live acoustically. Both the band and the fans enjoyed this new avenue of performance that allowed the ""quieter"" side of Floater to emerge and be explored. Of late, the band has begun playing shows where acoustic Floater opens for electric Floater - giving a sort of Jekyll and Hyde feel to their performances.

&gt; In 2002 Floater released their most critically acclaimed record to date, ""Alter."" Combining the bands strongest musical elements, ""Alter"" moves fluidly from heavy riffs to lullabies and tells flowing stories of fear, love and above all change.

&gt; August of 2004 - The release of the band's acoustic record, ""Acoustics."" Fans of Floater's electric shows responded with enthusiasm to the band's occasional acoustic performance - with their record label's encouragement, the band put together a uniquely recorded album - one that mimics the sound of their actual performances. Recorded in a studio built in the ballroom of their producers house, the record was made without digital editing and has a fresh, live feeling. 

&gt; Floater is also the name of a late nineties indiepop band from Sheffield, UK. They briefly rename themselves Floater UK before later reforming as Dangerlust. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Poi Dog Pondering is an American musical group, noted for its cross-pollination of diverse musical genres, including various forms of acoustic folk music, and electronic music. Founded in Hawaii in 1985 around the creative vision of lead singer-songwriter Frank Orrall, the band moved to Austin, Texas in 1987, where they recorded their first three albums. In 1992, the band (with ever-evolving membership) relocated once again, this time to Chicago, Illinois, and began to incorporate elements of house music into their style.

&gt; Orrall took the band's pop folk direction into electronic &amp; ambient house music in the later 1990's ,but has since returned to explore the soft rock, folk, country &amp; soul influences that gave the band it's initial audience on the indie Texas Hotel imprint and eventual major label contract with Columbia/Sony in the late 1980's.

&gt; Poi Dog Pondering ""the little big band with the strong back and supple/stubborn heart"" has been following its intuition for 20 years.  From bohemian street buskers to impossible-to-market major label sacrificial lambs, PdP have ripened into  staunchly independent musical voyagers.  Every sound that has excited them flows through their music and floods it with ever changing colors - acoustic, folk, global music, big band disco, electronic textures, orchestral collaborations, ROCK and SOUL - threaded with lyrics that embrace both the beauty and pain that life can bring.

&gt; Poi dog Pondering formed in Hawaii in 1986.  The first live performance was at the Honolulu Arts Academy.  Filled with youthful exuberance and inspiration from ready about Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground's  ""Exploding Plastic Inevitable"" projected film and music happening, PdP projected films of lava eruptions, ocean and other natural environments over the band as they performed.  The tradition of projected imagery along with PdP live performances has developed and matured over the years and continues.

&gt; There is a bolstered sense of history within the band now, a swagger that comes from having steadfastly carved their own path.  It is quite apparent that PdP has always been, and ever will be in it for the love of it; creating and performing.  Line up changes are par for the course.  PdP is an organic entity, it changes like life does.  But there is a core with strong roots, open to new eras and ready to experiment.  That's what keeps it vibrant.

&gt; Band leader, Frank Orrall's interest in electronic music garnered him respect from the Chicago House/Electronic music community for his solo project 8fatfat8, and lead him to become a member of Thievery Corporation as percussionist and vocalist.  All this influenced 2 of PDP’s Natural Thing and In Seed Comes Fruit albums which saw the band experimenting with electronic textures, beautiful lush arrangements and un-hurried, sometimes instrumental song structures, letting musicality determine the song structure, rather than traditional ""verse / chorus / bridge"" style song writing.

&gt; 
Poi dog Pondering delivered a Rock and Soul record with "" 7 "",their 7th studio album, 14 cuts deep and layered in horns, strings, immediate guitars; sometimes shimmering and liquid, &amp; sometimes ""crunch and gristle"".  A painter's  pallete of unique instruments, vintage keyboards, ""on the sleeve"" lyrics, gripping bass &amp; drums and beautiful harmonies.  Known for following their heart, this record finds PdP playful, intimate, honest, cocky, boisterous and definitely ready to take it live.

&gt; 

&gt; “Poi is becoming one of the longest running and most spirited do-it-yourself musical institutions in the country, defying the odds of commerce and interpersonal relationships by keeping a 12 piece band viable…” – GREG KOT, CHICAGO TRIBUNE

&gt; “The Poi Dog sound happens because of the real and deep connection between the
players, which shows in how they listen to one another in performance. The fact that most of them have been doing just that for two decades only increases the power of community they bring to the stage.” - NO DEPRESSION (January 2008, Live Review) Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Glen Hansard (born 21 April 1970) is an Irish singer-songwriter and actor. He is vocalist and guitarist for Irish group  The Frames and one half of folk-rock duo The Swell Season.

&gt; Hansard is said to have quit school at age 13 to begin busking on local Dublin streets. He first came to public attention as guitar player 'Outspan Foster' in the Alan Parker film The Commitments, a role he subsequently regretted, believing it distracted from his music career. In 2003 he presented the first series of Other Voices: Songs from a Room, which showcased Irish music talent on RTÉ. The album The Swell Season, in collaboration with a Czech singer and multi-instrumentalist Markéta Irglová, was released on in 2006 (the album also featured Marja Tuhkanen and Bertrand Galen).

&gt; Hansard starred in the movie 'Once' alongside Markéta Irglová which won a prestigious Sundance Audience Award in 2007, as well as the 2008 Academy Award for Best Original Song (for ""Falling Slowly""), beating three songs from the Disney musical ""Enchanted"" and one song from ""August Rush"" (both were heavy contenders). Its Irish release took place on 23rd March 2007 and appeared in cinemas further afield later in the year.

&gt; Hansard's album, Rhythm and Repose, was released in June 2012. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Mission of Burma is an American post-punk band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1979. The band was formed by Roger Miller (guitar), Clint Conley (bass), Peter Prescott (drums) and Martin Swope (tape manipulator/sound engineer). Miller, Conley and Prescott share singing and songwriting duties. Like many of their post-punk contemporaries, Mission of Burma's efforts are largely concerned with extending punk's original vocabulary without losing its essential rebellious spirit. Using rapid shifts in dynamics, unconventional time signatures and chord progressions along with tape effects, Mission of Burma challenges the prevailing idioms of punk while attempting to retain its power and immediacy.

&gt; In early years the band's audience was limited to the Boston area, with all their recordings released on the small Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. The band released only one album in its original form, Vs.. Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope, and has since recorded two more albums, ONoffON and The Obliterati.

&gt; Their wall-of-noise musical sound extended the vocabulary of punk while continuing to hold clear its sense of power and abandon.  They used a number of tape effects, different chord progressions, and time shifts to highlight their formal training in music.  Not only that but they are seen now as a highly influential band to both post-punk and experimental music to come after; many bands cite Burma as an inspiration, including Nirvana, Superchunk, Creed, The Grifters, R.E.M. (who regularly covered ""Academy Fight Song"" on their Green tour), Sonic Youth, Throwing Muses, Yo La Tengo, Soul Asylum, Pixies, Sugar, Catherine Wheel, Guided by Voices, Graham Coxon and Moby - the last two of which have covered """"That's When I Reach For My Revolver.""

&gt; The band were due to tour in 1980 with Joy Division but the suicide of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's singer, canceled the tour. In 1983, after releasing their only full-length studio record Vs., the group disbanded due to Miller's worsening tinnitus.

&gt; The band found increasing relevance throughout the 90s, culminating in the publication of Michael Azzerad's essays Our Band Could Be Your Life which featured Mission of Burma. In 2002, they reunited and began playing reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and formerly Prescott's Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller relates that ""when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin's position, we told him he could use current digital technology which accomplishes Martin's antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted for maintaining the original integrity, and uses a tape deck.""

Any train level where nothing outside the train matters is pretty indistinguishable from a long boring corridor level.

#Bad train levels:

**Black Ops (2?)** starts off with a train level, a simple linear go from the back to the front shooting experience. You go forward, and your options to go left or right or take cover are exceptionally limited. The rest of the game gives you more tactical freedom, but this is just a dull, blatantly railroaded (heh) meh. It doesn't even have the tactical precision of Modern Warfare's Mile High Club, which is roughly the same concept.

**[Defragmented](http://store.steampowered.com/app/426170/Defragmented/)**, it's a *good* indie game that's a top-down shooter, thoroughly enjoyable for all the levels that aren't the train one. The game is about creative movement, setting up skirmishes for your advantage, and tactics, so the level that's literally linear, cramped rooms without cover throws all of the game's advantages in the turbo shitter 9000. That's the **only** bad level, though, and I recommend the game regardless.

**The Secret World**, the train level *Last Train to Cairo* is *hell* to replay *over and over again*. Granted, playing it only once or twice it's fun and exciting, but the way TSW had it, you were encouraged to grind this and a few other story-arc-ending missions, and so the flaws *quickly* grate on you as you do this day after day after day. There's two parts where you click on a pipe and cross the horizontal ladder segment at a walking pace, doing nothing but holding left to agonizingly slowly reach the end. There's one part where you go to open a door, an ear-piercing alarm blares and waves of two enemies flood in. After about three waves of trash mobs, you hear a helicopter outside, and you could totally see it if you weren't *in a train car with a roof*, and then there's an explosion at the far end of the car which you're l**e**d to believe is missiles from the helicopter you can only see if you really fuck with the camera, and the fire slowly creeps toward you and the still-locked door and the still-blaring alarm. Single enemies jump in, one at a time, and they're not difficult, but there's like 6 of them, one at a time with delays between them, and this one segment takes like five whole minutes of waiting for another enemy to hop in so you can quickly kill him and keep waiting. Eventually as the slow flames get uncomfortably close, the next enemy spawned is behind the door, opens it, and miraculously you're free to keep moving forward. The rest of the level is **okay**. There's your typical ""jump over hanging signs in a tunnel"" jazz, the boss fight is decent, and nothing else is overly *bad* about the experience, but the whole mission doesn't really use any of the upsides to having a train. I only have a huge rant about this because of how much I (""had"" to) play it, it's not show-stoppingly awful.

#Some meh train levels

At this point, I've already been ranting about train levels, might as well touch on more even if I don't **hate** them. **Skip to the end** for me to talk about the ones I mentioned above: Lost Planet 2, Shadows of the Empire, and I'll talk about why Biker 2 works well.

**Uncharted 2**'s train level was *kind of good.* Kind of similar to TSW's train level, but with the parkour mechanics actually a fun part of the game instead of a boring horizontal ladder. You monkey around and you shoot people, just like you do in the rest of the game, and it doesn't feel out of place. The train itself is varied as you move forward, so you don't feel like you're walking through the same train car over and over. The world outside the train gives a good sense of moving along in the world, transitioning from a jungle to a giant bridge to a tunnel to... a desert? It's been a while. It hits on all the typical train level tropes: climbing on the side of a car, dodging hanging signs in a tunnel, boss who stands on a roof and shoots down at you, there's an angry helicopter, part of the train catches fire, there's a military tank on there for some reason... Y'know, all the usual tropes. But as you go along, the outside world **doesn't** feel like a looping Flintstones background, so they're doing something right. It's a very cinematic level in a very cinematic game.

**Jedi Knight 3: Jedi Academy** there's a hovertrain bit. (Hover bus train? It's got your stereotypical bomb on a train plot.) The train cars are much wider than typical train levels, with multiple floors and interiors and each car is a fun new battleground for the most part. The gameplay lends itself to enjoyable linear levels like this, and the music and scenery keep this level **exciting**.

I never played **Goldeneye**, but the train level's infamous so I at least [watched through it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDVOvzK_sX8). Looks to be a pretty run-of-the-mill train level. **Extra** tight corridors of enemies to mow down, plus a few wider cars to get a smidge of lateral movement. Use of passenger compartments to turn the player around add to the feeling that you're *on a train* and that there are things behind you as well and just enough backtracking to add to the immersion without being a grueling experience. The level was revolutionary at the time, now it's just **standard**.

**Mirror's Edge** at one point you're on top of subway trains dodging overhead signs. It's slightly out of place mechanic-wise, but it's short and gets to the point so it [doesn't really drag you out of the game](https://youtu.be/3fsu4miYMWo?t=5m54s).

**Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks**, you chart a path on a railway and on-rails shooter along that path, controlling the speed of your train and readjusting your path on the fly. It does things well, though my memories are a bit skewed by playing through it on a broken DS. Despite that, you're not *on* the train, you *are* the train so ehhh does it really count?

**[Snowpiercer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1706620)**: Train Level The Movie. The story's alright, it's a pretty good dystopia flick, where the further forward they go the more white privilege they drown in, and holy fuck the one shootout where the train's taking a huge turn. Uses the train concept very well. Gameplay sucks, I could only find the controls for pause and rewind. No matter how many times I replayed the shootout chapter I couldn't get a better ending.

I've heard mixed things about **[The Final Station](http://store.steampowered.com/app/435530/The_Final_Station/)**, which is Snowpiercer Zombie Apocalypse The Game. Most of the gameplay takes place *off* the train, and the train itself is basically your hub world between levels? And it's a bit too short? Steam reviews are very positive though, so... okay?

#Chasing the train

Chasing the train is also a rather common asp**e**ct of train levels; if there's not gameplay of catching the train, there's usually a cutscene where someone pulls a car alongside the train and you jump, so it's at least addressed.

**Dead Rising 2** has a fun train level; you chase the train around on a motorbike for quite a while until you can jump on, and then the train battle itself is short and sweet. The train's not that long, so there's no time for anything to feel stale or repetitive. The fact that you're riding in a circle through tunnels that you can *actually* go through on foot absolutely cements the train's presence in the physical world. They missed a lot of potential for this, looking back, but as it stands, this is a fun part of the game, frustrating if you suck at the motorbike.

**Star Fox 64**, one level is literally *just* chasing a train in a tank. It's fun enough and the train's presence properly grounds the progress forward, but honestly this is Just Another Tank Level, just centered around a train setpiece. The boss is alright. Bonus points for the secret ending.

**Grand Theft Auto 5**. There's a train mission, but more importantly there's the train itself in free roaming online. There's like a billion youtube videos of ""can you stop the train"" (spoiler alert: no), and of loud screeching grown men trying to climb onto the train with their friends. It's fun to try to get onto the train, and once you're on the train you're not like glitching off, but there's no additional fun in being on the train; all the fun's about *getting* there. There's also another subway train or two that you have to wait at the station for, and those are more exciting 'cause it's harder to get on (because **waiting** and **patience** in GTA), but on all the trains, you end up looking outside and seeing all the roads you've driven up and down a billion times at much faster speeds while doing more interesting things. The train mission in Single Player is... forgettable but it's got a few novelties.

**GTA San Andreas**: I heard that level left a lot of controllers smashed against the wall. You chase the train and then... get on it and the level ends? 100% chase.

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; On February 22, 2008, they played a small show for fans at Queen Margaret Union to debut new songs from the upcoming album. About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. The first single from the album was called ""Mistress Mabel"" and was released on May 26, 2008. The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd.

On February 4th 2013, The Fratellis announced they had finished recording their third album, which was revealed to be called We Need Medicine with a release date of October 7th 2013. ""Seven Nights Seven Days"" was released as a single on September 29th. The album was recorded in Glasgow with Jon Fratelli and Stuart McCredie on production duties.

&gt; On the 24th of April 2013 it was announced that The Fratellis would be headlining Brownstock Festival in Essex on Sunday the 1st of September.

❤ How to improve Vidme...

🎯 and help them hit the bulls eye regarding their mission to build ""the world's most creator-friendly video community."" 

🔘 Enable MP3 uploads 

Why have a visual-free podcast be in a video format instead of MP3 (or whatever other audio files is acceptable)? Surely if they can enable video uploads, they can enable audio uploads right? This would enable Vidme to tap into the Mixcloud market. 

🔘 Enable creators to have a channel blog 

YouTube has tested this concept out on the popular channel ASAP Science as you can see at https://www.youtube.com/user/AsapSCIENCE/community and they refer to it with the generic heading ""Community. It would be awesome if Vidme enabled this with text color options, upload photo options, and (as I already mentioned) upload audio options. This would also enable them to become more competitive with Patreon and also provide another Subscription tier perk for creators. 

🔘 Enable Live Stream 

Live streaming is the future. This request that has been made by many, many creators here on their reddit page. Duffy has replied ""lots of people ask about this!"" and also ""livestreaming is a very real possibility in the future! It's a huge initiative from both the tech and community POV and if/when we move in that direction. "" 

🔘 Enable multiple channel management from 1 account 

This is a no-brainer regarding how obvious this is in enabling ease of access, functionality, and workflow of creators who are gifted enough to manage multiple channels. 

🔘 Verification that treats all creators more equally 

Change ""have 50 followers"" from a suggestion to an absolute requirement for verification. However, there should be exemptions for creators who arrive at Vidme with large fan bases since they've already shown they know how to build a fan base and how to make content popular enough to attract a fan base. This exemption should be written. Otherwise they're allowing a perception of favoritism and as I've seen in the comments here at Reddit, creators don't feel it's unfair and don't like it. 

🔘 Hot/trending page - treat all creators equally 

Stop removing categories from appearing on the Hot/trending page if they dominate the page because they're so successful. Instead, simply limit the amounts of vids per category that can appear at a time 

🔘 Create a spotlight page. 

The ""Community"" page and ""featured"" sidebar list is not very enticing. A spotlight page could contain Video or written interviews with new creators to help them attain discoverablity. Vidme recently did this on their own channel with an ""Emerging Vidme creators showcase"" video (https://vid.me/C21Fc) but since their channel has a lot of other content, it's not as potentially helpful for discovery of new creators as a page/tab entirely dedicated to this would be. If they cannot afford the time and expense to do this then outsource the work (especially written interviews) to the creator community and reward them with cash or by promoting their channels on the trending page. 

🔘 Help newbies and amateurs get seen 

There's a catch 22 discoverablity problem for newbie, amateur-level types. How can they ever attain the first 50 followers and get seen when their new videos aren't allowed to be seen on the New page or Hot/trending page?  Perhaps video should offer more discoverablity options for creators if they arrive to Vidme with at least 5 new, original, and exclusive videos. Vidme could then place them on the spotlight page.  

🔘 Provide evidence-based success strategy insights 

Vidme should outline evidence-based best practices to attain the first 50 followers and how to overall succeed as a Vidme creator. YouTube has their Creator Academy. Vidme does not need to make something that extensive, just a one page outline summary as part of their About Vidme pages. 
 
🔘 Do better at public relations 

Have better public relations savvy replies to major changes (such as the rumored new storage limit), controversies, and disputes with creators. I love Vidme and want so badly for this site to succeed but their lack of PR-savvy replies to some conflicts with creators were cringe-inducing to watch. They should be addressing these things on their Vidme video channel, not just here on reddit or on their blog where a limited amount of people will see it 

What's more, as I pointed out in this post, Vidme was not replying to a lot of creators despite calling on us for feedback https://www.reddit.com/r/vidme/comments/6s3hia/vidme_leadership_please_keep_up_the_replies/

A good example of a good PR reply can be seen here: 

""Patreon CEO on Content Policy, Lauren Southern, and IGD"" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmcK6GvgVPs) by Patreon CEO Jack Conte as an example of a great way to reply to controversies. While the vid may have majority thumbs down from the ideologes who hate Patreon for demonetizing Lauren Southern, any reasonable person watching the video can see he directly addresses the issue, offers clearly understandable and evidence-based reasoning for Patreon's decision, he explains how Patreon will do better, and he conveys empathy to Lauren Southern.

🔘 Forums should be on Vidme's site, not on Reddit 

Being able to participate on forums directly at Vidme instead of having to do it elsewhere (such as here on Reddit) would lessen the work for creators who are already busy with the duties of numerous roles often as a 1-person crew. Having to create multiple accounts on multiple sites is burdensome. As of the time I'm writing this, it's almost 6:15pm 8/7/17 here in SoCal and the ""Subreddit Info"" sidebar to the right indicates only 31 people are online here now. 

Perhaps the forum could allow for groups similar to the Facebook groups and Google+ groups concepts.

🔘 Create a collaboration forum page on Vidme's website. 

Speaking of forums, create a ""Criagslist gigs"" type forum at the Vidme site enabling creators to find collaborators. For example, let's say I wrote a song and I have the equipment to make a music video - but I can't sing. It would be awesome if I could post a ""Seeking singer collaborator"" post at this hypothetical forum page. 

🔘 Creator hierarchy labeling

I agree with @VikingTheMad but instead of them being channel tags (Professional, Hobby, Group, Network, etc.) how about make those labels appear next to or underneath the username? 

In other words, staff-labeling or community-labeling of a channel's status in a hierarchy - perhaps with labels like ""New creator"" or ""Indie Creator"" or ""Underdog Creator"" or ""Advanced Creator,"" etc... This is a similar concept to YouTube Creator Hub – Benefit Levels.

🔘 Encourage and reward creator mentoring

Vidme could offer rewards/perks for large creators who mentor smaller channels. T-shirts alone won't suffice. Rewards should be things like a coupon for ""no admin fees"" for 1 video or ""one day on the trending page"" or something like that. 

🔘 Creator accounts vs viewer/commenter accounts

Vidme should distinguish between viewer accounts and creator accounts. I never understood why YouTube and other video venues treated all accounts the same. If a person just wants to be a viewer and/or commenter, then there's no reason to give them all of the features of a regular creator. Just let fans sign up as fans and creators sign up as creators. Of course, if a fan ever wants to be come a creator, enabling that type of profile to turn into a creator profile would be ideal.

🔘 Verification denial explanations

Creators here at Vidme's reddit have complained about not getting explanations when their verification application is denied. The denial letter indicates they don't have time to explain why to everyone - but that makes no sense since they clearly had time to review the channel. So even if it's a copy &amp; paste job, give the creator some insight on where they went wrong.  

🔘 ""LGBT"" or ""Groups"" or ""Communities"" or ""Diversity"" should be a Vidme category 

As a gay man, referring to any aspects of me being gay as ""Lifestyle"" is condescending and offensive so I would not want to put LGBT vids there. Also, not all LGBT content is political. I see no category that would presently make sense for LGBT videos. I think the only Category that would make sense would be ""LGBT"" or ""Groups"" or ""Communities"" or ""Diversity"" or something like that.

Thanks.

&gt; August and After are an indie-folk trio based in London. They weave together rich three part harmonies on classically inspired layers of guitar, viola, piano, synth and percussion.
 
Songwriters Ned and Vedantha originally met whilst studying at Cambridge. After countless nights spent honing their vocal harmonies and intricate guitar playing, they moved to London where they met Jordan, a classical violist, studying at the Royal Academy of Music. The three whiled away an afternoon on London’s Southbank, talking about their favourite musicians; the likes of Bon Iver and Kings of Convenience. They formed as August and After, and after many sold-out London shows, support slots for artists such as Ghostpoet and Scott Matthews, a Ronnie Scott’s residency and several European tours, they travelled to Paris to record their debut EP, Cascades, with French producer Jonathan Lefèvre-Reich (We Were Evergreen).
 
With support from the likes of BBC 6 Music, Kerrang! Radio and a stream of online press, and Wolves featured on Spotify UK’s official Your Coffee Break playlist garnering over 200k plays in a matter of weeks, the trio will head to the studio fresh from a set at this year’s Secret Garden Party, to start recording two follow-up singles.

&gt; Cass McCombs (born in Concord, California in 1977) is an American singer-songwriter and performer.

&gt; An enigmatic folk nomad, McCombs is a quintessentially American artist; ""he's quietly become one of (the country's) finest chroniclers of fringe characters, a writer of heart-rending love songs and psychedelic odes to the natural world, a teller of tall-tales with a sense of humor dry as desert wood, and that rare folksinger who actually sings about the folk."" His vocals range somewhere between the anxious drone of Lou Reed, the hollow croon of Elliott Smith, the lilting melody of Morrissey, and the driving earnestness and complexity of bards such as Leonard Cohen or Bob Dylan. His lyrical style is alternately vivid and weary, laconic and yearning, or drifting into the high-spirited and whimsical.

&gt; After cutting his first EP, Not the Way in San Francisco in 2001, McCombs relocated to Baltimore, MD. There he released ""Not the Way"" in 2002 and recorded his first full-length, A, in 2003 on Monitor Records. He spent the next few years touring: playing All Tomorrow's Parties; and opening for bands such as Modest Mouse, The Decemberists, and Belle and Sebastian; before recording his second LP PREfection, which was released on 4AD in 2005. 

&gt; McCombs' subsequent releases have been on the highly successful British independent label Domino Recording Co. 2007's Dropping the Writ was named one of Amazon's Best Albums of that year. Catacombs was voted one of the 50 greatest albums of 2009 by Pitchfork Media, and features Academy Award-nominated actress and singer Karen Black on the track Dreams-Come-True-Girl. During this period, McCombs toured with the likes of Arcade Fire, Andrew Bird, Band of Horses, José González, Beach House, and The Walkmen.

&gt; Catacombs also established McCombs' relationship with engineer/producer Ariel Rechtshaid, member of The Hippos and Foreign Born, who produced Grammy-winning hit Climax for Usher, the Plain White T's Grammy-nominated No.1 platinum-selling single Hey There Delilah, and albums for Vampire Weekend, Sky Ferreira, Snoop Lion, and Haim, among others.

&gt; In 2010 McCombs played Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago, L.A.'s Culture Collide Festival and Invisible Children Benefit. 2011 offered an extensive headlining tour, an appearance at SXSW, and two albums released by McCombs and produced by Rechtshaid: Wit's End in April and Humor Risk in November. The two albums were made simultaneously. In an interview with Pitchfork, McCombs explains: ""Wit's End was started years ago and it slowly made its way to the finish line. Humor Risk was just punched out. They're friends but they're different. Wit's End is like a stew; Humor Risk is the raw food diet.""

&gt; Big Wheel and Others, McCombs' seventh full-length (and first double album) was released in October 2013. The album is rooted in the Americana mythos of the Wild West, from the San Francisco drug culture to the gunslingers and gold rush of the nineteenth century. The album once again features Karen Black on a version of the track Brighter!, her final recording before passing away due to ampullary cancer in August, 2013. Big Wheel is dedicated to her memory.

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD ""Edgy In Brixton"" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London. The DVD contains a full live performance of the debut album Costello Music, B-Sides from various singles and a new song called Pretty Like a Girl. Extras on the DVD include the band being asked questions by members of The Fratellis' website, and on the deluxe edition, highlights from the T In The Park 2007 festival. It was released in the United States on the 30 October 2007

&gt; 2007-2008: Here We Stand

&gt; On November 20, 2007, it was announced on the Fratellis' official website that work had begun on the second album in rehearsal space in Glasgow. The band stated that they are self-producing the album and have their own studio to record in. Recording finished on January 13, 2008.

&gt; On February 22, 2008, they played a small show for fans at Queen Margaret Union to debut new songs from the upcoming album. About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. The first single from the album was called ""Mistress Mabel"" and was released on May 26, 2008. The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd. The Fratellis released a deluxe edition of Here We Stand internationally on December the 8th. The CD includes a new song titled 'Moriarty's Last Stand' and the accompanying DVD includes ""The Year Of The Thief"" (A documentary of the band on the road in the US); A live show filmed on June 18th 2008 at the Fillmore, San Francisco; performances of Milk and Money, Flathead and Mistress Mabel from Abbey Road Studios and the videos for the singles Mistress Mabel and Look Out Sunshine!
On April, 22 2010, both singer Jon Lawler and bassist Barry Wallace posted messages on their forum saying the band are unlikely to record together again soon.

&gt; The Fratellis have announced during June 2012 that they have decided to reform to help raise money for The Eilidh Brown Memorial Fund on the 15th of June at the MacRobert Centre in Stirling. The band plans on announcing more dates for later in the year.
The band then announced an extensive UK tour during December 2012 to take place in April 2013. During the UK tour, 3 more songs were debuted live; ""She's Not Gone Yet (But She's Leaving), Seven Days and Whiskey Saga.
On February 4th 2013, The Fratellis announced they had finished recording their third album, which was revealed to be called We Need Medicine with a release date of October 7th 2013. ""Seven Nights Seven Days"" was released as a single on September 29th. The album was recorded in Glasgow with Jon Fratelli and Stuart McCredie on production duties.

&gt; On the 24th of April 2013 it was announced that The Fratellis would be headlining Brownstock Festival in Essex on Sunday the 1st of September.

&gt; On the 22nd June 2013 The Fratellis headlined New College Commemoration Ball, a white-tie Ball set in the grounds of New College, Oxford.

&gt; Life began for Kamasi Washington on February 18, 1981 in Los Angeles, California. In the Washington family music was more of a prerequisite than a privilege. But Kamasi never saw it that way, his love for music began at first sound. His father, Rickey Washington is a professional saxophonist by night and a high school music teacher by day. Kamasi’s mother, Valerie Washington is an accomplished flutist who fell in love with the world of science and became a high school chemistry teacher after her stint as a genetic researcher. By the age of two Kamasi had already began to play the drums and piano, the only thing that kept him away from the wind instruments at that early age was his lack of dental development. He began his exploration into the world of the reeds and brass when he was about seven and his father gave him a clarinet. By the age of twelve Kamasi had found his voice in the form of a tenor saxophone, in fact it was the same saxophone that his father played in high school. 

&gt; Over the next year Kamasi’s development and devotion to music had out grown his academic environment. So he transferred from The Los Angeles Center of Enriched Studies (one the top academic high schools in the nation) and enrolled into the Hamilton High School Music Academy. It was around this time that Kamasi also joined The Multi School Jazz Band (M.S.J.B.), an assembly of the finest young jazz musicians in Los Angeles County and led by Reginald Andrews the same man that taught Kamasi’s father in high school. Because of the sheer vastness of talent that he was surrounded by it was in The Multi School Jazz Band that Kamasi was most inspired during his high school years. Through M.S.J.B. Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi’s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as “The Young Jazz Giants”. 
This fiery group of “Young Giants” wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year “The Young Jazz Giants” had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. 

&gt; After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson’s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album “In My Time” which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi’s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called “Bird Man Records” heard him playing with “The Young Jazz Giants” and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the “big break” for “The Young Jazz Giants” but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after its completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay “ready and waiting” for too long, thus “The Young Jazz Giants” unofficially disbanded. 

&gt; Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called “The Next Step” and that’s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking. 

&gt; (2) Kamasi Washington didn't pick up a saxophone until he was 13 years old, but by that point, he'd been playing several other instruments. That's when he found his calling. Within a couple years, he was the lead tenor saxophonist at Hamilton High School Music Academy in his native Los Angeles. After graduation, he attended UCLA to study ethnomusicology. While enrolled at UCLA, he recorded a self-titled album with Young Jazz Giants, a quartet he had formed with Cameron Graves and brothers Ronald Bruner, Jr. and Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner, released in 2004. From that point, Washington continually performed and recorded with an impressive variety of major artists across several genres, including Snoop Dogg, Raphael Saadiq, Gerald Wilson, McCoy Tyner, George Duke, and PJ Morton. In 2014 alone, Washington demonstrated tremendous range with appearances on Broken Bells' After the Disco, Harvey Mason's Chameleon, Stanley Clarke's Up, and Flying Lotus' You're Dead!, among other albums that covered indie rock, contemporary and progressive jazz, and experimental electronic music. 

&gt;  The following year, Washington contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly and finally debuted as a leader with The Epic, released on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label. An expansive triple album nearly three hours in duration, it involved the other three-quarters of Young Jazz Giants -- by then part of his larger ten piece collective, altnerately known as The Next Step and West Coast Get Down-- string orchestra and choir conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. 

&gt;  The Epic was a critical and commerial success. Not only did it land at number three on the jazz charts, it also found its way on to independent albums and heatseekers charts as well. Washington and his band were not only able to tour the U.S., but to play in Europe and Japan as well. ~ Andy Kellman

Well, obviously art and entertainment is subjective, so what I find appealing on the big screen might not be what you do, and vice-versa. However I think the large majority of the movie enjoying audience would agree that the big spectacle movies and the big epics (Avatar, superhero movies, Star Wars, etc) along with some communal experience movies (horror and comedies) are what come to mind as the movies they want to pay to go to a theater and see. That if they have the choice between Episode 8 at the theater or at home on their 32"" HDTV, they are going to pick theater. But if they are given the same choice with say 'The Big Sick', they are much more likely to watch it at home. 

&gt;The screen is the same size for both movies.

Yes, but character driven pieces like say 'The Big Sick' don't utilize the scope the same way a huge blockbuster does. It's like how people say 'Game of Thrones' is so cinematic and it's like watching a movie on TV. Why do they say that? Because of the scope of the visuals, the production value, the grand/epic story being shown to us the audience. Compare that to something like 'The Office' and those are two totally different experiences. I'd kill to watch each GoT episode for the first time in a movie theater but I'd kill if someone forced me to watch 'The Office' at the theater. Putting that show on that big of a screen would do nothing for my viewing experience. 

&gt;which movies benefit most from that is totally subjective

Yes, but in general I think averages exist and most people (not on reddit per-se but in the real world) are going to agree with what I said. I'd say ""if they had to pick which movies to see in theater and which to watch at home opening day they'd..."" but let's be honest, the box office already proves my point. The big epic movies (Star Wars, MCU, Apes, etc) make huge $$$ from the droves of people who go see them and how many people go see 'The Big Sick' or any of the Oscar nominated movies? 

How many people would check out the Oscar nominated movies if they released VOD the same time (or a week later) as their theatrical premier? Probably not a ton but I imagine a not insignificant amount. I know I would. I am not going to spend $12 for a movie ticket (and risk dealing with annoying people) for 'Lion' or 'The Lobster' but would love  to rent them for $5 to watch (especially pre-Oscars). Imagine the Amazon Academy Awards Package they could make which has every nominated best film bundled together to rent for $30 before the Oscars air so you can be prepared. 

&gt;For me, Marvel movies are visually bland as hell and do not really feel like movies. So, they are not the movies I would prioritize seeing in theaters. 

But you must realize how incredibly small the group is of movie-goers that think the same thing you do, right? You see the box office numbers, reviews and audience ravings about the MCU movies right? Of course you do. So your point is fairly nullified because while you are at home not going to Avengers 4, millions of people will be doing that and likely setting a box office record when it comes out. 

&gt;that would be pretty unfair to people with my tastes.

But that's life. People with a taste for records over digital music have to accept that the medium has changed and adapt. Again, I am not pro-only big movies in theaters or anything. If some theaters want to show smaller films or non-blockbuster films on their screens then go for it, I hope they succeed. But just because things in Hollywood are a certain way (theater releases, prices, blockbusters, indie films, VOD, pay scale, budgets, etc) doesn't mean they always will be or should be. A lot of big names in the movie business are expecting it to implode. The business model right now is pretty awful and if it wasn't for [Superhero movies Hollywood would be in a horrible place](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/16/superheroes-are-almost-single-handedly-saving-the-us-box-office.html). The big actors are over paid, the business relies too heavily on blockbusters, the budgets are bloated, they are behind the times in terms of technology (VOD, etc) and more. 

You talk about unfair for your tastes, and I can't help but think of the people who complain about the middle class and indie class of movies disappearing. Yeah, that sucks and as I just said, Hollywood betting only on blockbusters is extremely dangerous. However, if it wasn't for all that talent not having jobs, we wouldn't be living in the golden age of TV. The golden age of TV (i'm including online streaming in TV) is directly tied to all the acting talent, directors, writers, DP's, and everyone else who took their indie/middle-class stories and artistic talent (not commercialized or homogenized for mass liking) and went to TV. So many great TV shows we've gotten and are getting right now are in thanks to all those people moving into the TV space. 

So who knows, maybe it would suck that smaller movies and character pieces (like Oscar nominated movies) stop showing up in theaters, but maybe more people start watching them because they are available on VOD, and maybe with more customers the creators get to make more content and sell it directly to the customer. Nolan says one thing but look at all the amazing talent that is signing the praises of online streaming, VOD, paid cable and cable TV as spaces to make great content. The highly respected talent praising Netflix/Amazon/etc for the lack of shekels to ridiculous things like time constraints, writing in story breaks for commercials, bans on certain words or nudity, requirements to be episodic or not touch on certain topics and all other types of ridiculous restrictions and requirements that studios and the FCC demand.

&gt; Mission of Burma is an American post-punk band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1979. The band was formed by Roger Miller (guitar), Clint Conley (bass), Peter Prescott (drums) and Martin Swope (tape manipulator/sound engineer). Miller, Conley and Prescott share singing and songwriting duties. Like many of their post-punk contemporaries, Mission of Burma's efforts are largely concerned with extending punk's original vocabulary without losing its essential rebellious spirit. Using rapid shifts in dynamics, unconventional time signatures and chord progressions along with tape effects, Mission of Burma challenges the prevailing idioms of punk while attempting to retain its power and immediacy.

&gt; In early years the band's audience was limited to the Boston area, with all their recordings released on the small Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. The band released only one album in its original form, Vs.. Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope, and has since recorded two more albums, ONoffON and The Obliterati.

&gt; Their wall-of-noise musical sound extended the vocabulary of punk while continuing to hold clear its sense of power and abandon.  They used a number of tape effects, different chord progressions, and time shifts to highlight their formal training in music.  Not only that but they are seen now as a highly influential band to both post-punk and experimental music to come after; many bands cite Burma as an inspiration, including Nirvana, Superchunk, Creed, The Grifters, R.E.M. (who regularly covered ""Academy Fight Song"" on their Green tour), Sonic Youth, Throwing Muses, Yo La Tengo, Soul Asylum, Pixies, Sugar, Catherine Wheel, Guided by Voices, Graham Coxon and Moby - the last two of which have covered """"That's When I Reach For My Revolver.""

&gt; The band were due to tour in 1980 with Joy Division but the suicide of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's singer, canceled the tour. In 1983, after releasing their only full-length studio record Vs., the group disbanded due to Miller's worsening tinnitus.

&gt; The band found increasing relevance throughout the 90s, culminating in the publication of Michael Azzerad's essays Our Band Could Be Your Life which featured Mission of Burma. In 2002, they reunited and began playing reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and formerly Prescott's Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller relates that ""when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin's position, we told him he could use current digital technology which accomplishes Martin's antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted for maintaining the original integrity, and uses a tape deck.""

&gt; Editors are a British indie rock/post-punk revival band from Birmingham, England, formed by Tom Smith (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Russell Leetch (bass) Ed Lay (drums) and Chris Urbanowicz (guitar)  who met while studying at Staffordshire University, in Stafford, England, United Kingdom during 2002. After Chris' departure in 2012 , Justin Lockey and Elliott Williams joined the band for their live gigs and participated in the recording of the fourth album.

&gt; The band were originally known as (The) Pride, before they changed their line-up and became known as Snowfield, becoming a popular unsigned band. They remained with this name until they signed with Kitchenware Records in September 2004. The band's debut single Bullets was released as a limited edition of 500 on Kitchenware Records on January 24, 2005; it quickly gained support from radio stations such as Xfm and BBC 6 Music - where it was the single of the week.

&gt; Their debut album, The Back Room, was released on 25 July 2005, to critical acclaim. The band toured out most of 2005, including two jaunts with We Are Scientists. However, after a pivotal support slot on Franz Ferdinand's Arena tour at the end of 2005, it was the re-release of single Munich in January 2006 that propelled them into the top 10 of the UK single's chart. The following May, Editors played three sell-out shows at London's Brixton Academy, and countless gigs worldwide. The album has now sold over 500,000 units.

&gt; In June 2007 Editors released a second album, An End has a Start which included the single Smokers Outside The Hospital Doors. This first track was released on June 18th 2007 in the UK, and June 26th in the US, however it was leaked onto the Internet earlier. The album's title track, An End Has A Start was released on September 3rd, The Racing Rats on November 26th, 2007. Following a landmark appearence on The Other Stage at the Glastonbury festival, the album entered at number 1 in the UK album chart. 

&gt; 'In this Light And On This Evening', the third studio album, was released on October 12th 2009. With the heavy synthesizer sound and industrial ring, the album differed immensely from the earlier work of the band. Tom explained this change as a way for the band to try something completely different. Papillon, the first single, was followed by You Don't Know Love. The third single was Eat Raw Meat = Blood Drool. The album was inspired by the city of London, both lyrically as musically and debuted at number 1 in the UK album charts.

&gt; On April 16th 2012, during the recording of their fourth studio album with producer Flood, Editors announced that Chris Urbanowicz (guitar) was leaving the band basing the decision entirely upon the band's future musical direction.

&gt; ‘The Weight Of Your Love’, their fourth studio LP, was released on July 2013. It was preceded by the single 'A ton of love, released in May. This is also the first album to feature new band members Justin Lockey and Elliott Williams. It was recorded at Blackbird Studio in Nashville with producer Jacquire King and mixed by Craig Silvey.

&gt; C Duncan (born Christopher Duncan, 29 July 1989) is a Scottish composer and musician. His debut album, Architect, was nominated for the 2015 Mercury Music Prize.

&gt; The son of two classical musicians, he was surrounded by music throughout his childhood. He initially took up piano and viola. His teens led him to school bands – learning to play guitar, bass and drums – but did little to quell his fascination with the composition and performance of classical music. He eventually enrolled in Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland) to study music composition, where his pieces were performed by various ensembles across the UK.

&gt; To hear C Duncan’s music now is to grasp those two common threads between his interests in classical and modern music. The pieces that make up his forthcoming debut LP are formed from lush choral harmonies and acoustic instrumentation, textured like contemporary dreampop and all recorded at home in Glasgow on his bedroom studio setup, gradually built up one layer and one instrument at a time. The results of this methodical and isolationist recording process give us charming lo-fi folk with the harmonic width of choral composition, the sweetness of barbershop and the rough eloquence that has so readily soundtracked Glasgow over the past decades.

&gt; He is also an accomplished painter, naming Grant Wood and Gerhard Richter as influences. His work has been exhibited throughout Scotland and he provides cover art for his own records, expressing the same musical ideas through painted image. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Age doesn’t necessarily denote musical prowess, but for My American Heart, a band who wrote their debut when most of the members were merely 16, making great music has only been augmented by three years of touring, practice and acquired knowledge. The San Diego fivesome’s dynamic, innovative second record reverberates with a sense of newfound wisdom and the sort of skill that comes only from that hard-earned experience, a reminder of how shockingly young the makers of the record actually are. The strikingly varied disc, metaphorically entitled Hiding Inside the Horrible Weather to denote the beauty that inherently lies in all things, soars from hooky, driving rock (“The Shake (Awful Feeling)” and “Boys! Grab Your Guns”) to introspective acoustic ballad (“Tired and Uninspired”) to expansive searches that reveal a whole new side of My American Heart (“Dangerous” and “Fantasy”). Soliman’s lyrics are noticeably more refined, spinning with clever turns of phrase and poetically-inclined verses- yet another gleaming facet of evident growth on the record.

&gt; Hiding Inside the Horrible Weather is the result of six months of heavy writing time, although some of the album’s tracks come from nearly a year before it was recorded. Following the band’s beloved debut, The Meaning in Makeup, which the group feels was slightly rushed, for this record My American Heart had time to really craft what they consider to be an album that represents how far they have come. “We actually took our time to write this record,” says Soliman. “It was a lot of fun creating this record and expressing ourselves and actually growing as musicians together. Just figuring out what we’re capable of. It was definitely a huge step up from the last record.”

&gt; Armed with new guitarist Matthew VanGasbeck, formerly of Downtown Singapore, who joined the writing process in November, My American Heart entered the studio on February 4th. After whittling down a long list of possible producers, the group chose James Paul Wisner, the producer behind bands like Underoath, The Academy Is and Dashboard Confessional, who Soliman calls the “perfect fit for this record.” In Wisner’s St. Cloud, FL Studio, just south of Orlando, the quintet dove headfirst into an encouraging, creative environment that helped them pen the next tracks to the record. “He helped us really explore ideas and he really listened to the songs,” Barrera notes of the experience. “He was huge part of the record.”

&gt; My American Heart has certainly not eschewed their engaging pop sensibilities, but even former disbelievers won’t be able to deny the range and strength of the songwriting on Hiding Inside the Horrible Weather or the memorability of the tracks, which the band hopes will be drawn to any listener who happens to hear them. As far as huge steps up go, this is a massive one, and the significance of that is not lost on My American Heart. “I just want people to really open their minds to this and give some consideration to how much we’ve grown since the last record,” Soliman says. “We really learned that we are better than what we thought we could be.” Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Floater began in 1993 when Robert Wynia (lead vocals, bass), Peter Cornett (drums), and Dave Amador (guitar), got together in Eugene, Oregon, making their start at garage parties and the U of O beer garden. With compelling lyrics and adept storytelling, their music shifts in mood from the insistent and heavy to the melodic and soulful, comprising the signature sound for which Floater is best known.

&gt; Floater's regional success was noticed by Elemental Records, who put out their first full-length record, ""Sink"" in 1994. That same year Floater began a string of sold out shows at the Community Center for the Performing Arts (The WOW Hall) that is still unbroken to this day.

&gt; In 1995 Floater released ""Glyph"" and toured the country for the next two years supporting the record. The single, ""Danny Boy"" received heavy college and commercial radio play, in many cities outselling major label releases. Floater received nominations to the preliminary level of the Grammy's from NARAS (National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences) in 1995 under Best Rock Performance for ""Sink"" and in 1996 under Best Alternative Performance for ""Glyph."" (Prelims are determined by nominations from the NARAS members).

&gt; In 1998, following their move to Portland, Oregon (where the band currently resides), Floater released their third full-length record, ""Angels in the Flesh and Devils in the Bone."" The second concept album by the band (""Sink"" was the first), ""Angel's"" brought a new vibe to Floater. It wasn't long before widespread audiences came to embrace what has now become the band's trademark - their versatility. 

&gt; September of 2000 brought the release of Floater's fourth full- length record, ""Burning Sosobra""; a musical collection that explores the band's broad range of song writing. Following its release, the band began to perform live acoustically. Both the band and the fans enjoyed this new avenue of performance that allowed the ""quieter"" side of Floater to emerge and be explored. Of late, the band has begun playing shows where acoustic Floater opens for electric Floater - giving a sort of Jekyll and Hyde feel to their performances.

&gt; In 2002 Floater released their most critically acclaimed record to date, ""Alter."" Combining the bands strongest musical elements, ""Alter"" moves fluidly from heavy riffs to lullabies and tells flowing stories of fear, love and above all change.

&gt; August of 2004 - The release of the band's acoustic record, ""Acoustics."" Fans of Floater's electric shows responded with enthusiasm to the band's occasional acoustic performance - with their record label's encouragement, the band put together a uniquely recorded album - one that mimics the sound of their actual performances. Recorded in a studio built in the ballroom of their producers house, the record was made without digital editing and has a fresh, live feeling. 

&gt; Floater is also the name of a late nineties indiepop band from Sheffield, UK. They briefly rename themselves Floater UK before later reforming as Dangerlust. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Temposhark are an English electronic rock band, formed in London, UK and Brighton by singer and songwriter Robert Diament. Temposhark are best known for their songs Bye Bye Baby, Joy, It's Better To Have Loved and Not That Big, a duet with singer Imogen Heap, which is featured on their 2008 debut album The Invisible Line. Other notable artist collaborations include Guy Sigsworth, Sean McGhee, Youth (aka Martin Glover from Killing Joke), Kate Havnevik and the virtuoso violinist Sophie Solomon. Their second album 'Threads' was released in 2010.

&gt; Diament set up his own UK record label in December 2004 called Paper and Glue releasing a series of limited edition Temposhark singles, the first of which was their critically acclaimed EP Neon Question Mark. 

&gt; Temposhark quickly collaborated with singer Imogen Heap (Frou Frou), received club remixes from electro pioneers including Cursor Miner, Mark Moore (S'Express), Melnyk, Metronomy, Avril (FCommunications), Carmen Rizzo and Crispin J Glover as well as hip-hop crew Border Crossing, Masashi Naka (Escalator Records, Japan), Akira the Don and electropunk duo Noblesse Oblige. The band have also written two short film soundtracks for fine artist Justine Pearsall.

&gt; A second EP 'Invisible Ink/Little White Lie' came out in May 2005 which attracted many new admirers including acclaimed producer Guy Sigsworth, best known for his work with Madonna, Björk and Britney Spears. Sigsworth went on to produce Temposhark's first nationwide released UK single It's Better To Have Loved, which came out as a limited edition CD on December 12th 2005. All of these early Temposhark limited edition EPs came in deluxe packaging helping to create a buzz around the band in creative circles and with their fanbase. The band themselves were never pictured on the sleeves instead choosing striking original art images and stylish die-cut record sleeves.

&gt; In 2005, Diament said that his band name was thought up when he ""woke up in the midst of a dream one night, at like 4am, and just said the word Temposhark. So it came from my subconscious I guess. Honestly it was that simple. I wanted a name that sounded strong. I liked the idea that music could be a weapon. Something powerful..""

&gt; In May 2006 Temposhark released their second nationwide single Joy on limited edition CD and 7” vinyl and the band set out on a UK tour visiting towns all over the UK. These dates included a very high profile London show at Tate Britain on Fri May 5th and Carling Academy Islington on Sat May 20th. Temposhark gained many new fans when Joy was featured on the front homepage of iTunes UK and in iTunes’ weekly newsletter.

&gt; In 2007, Temposhark toured the USA with their full band as well as completing their debut album, to be released in March 2008.

&gt; Temposhark's debut album The Invisible Line will be released in Spring 2008 in both UK and USA/Canada. It was produced and recorded in London by rising producer Sean McGhee with two tracks produced by Guy Sigsworth. The album includes the song Blame, which was co-written with legendary producer Youth aka Martin Glover from Killing Joke as well as a duet with Imogen Heap called Not That Big.

&gt; On March 15th 2007 at the South by Southwest 2007 festival, Temposhark announced on stage that their debut album was to be called The Invisible Line. Singer Robert Diament has said that the album title was inspired by controversial British artist Tracey Emin from passages in her books Exploration Of The Soul (1994) and Strangeland (2005).

&gt; A behind-the-scenes video of Temposhark recording at London's RAK Studios was released on YouTube.com on May 26th 2007. The video was synced up to the full album version of the Temposhark song Blame. This is thought to be the first preview of the newly recorded album version of the song.

&gt; In October 2007, Temposhark's song Blame, taken from their forthcoming album, was nominated in the Best International category at the Ontario Independent Music Awards which take place in Toronto, Canada on November 15th 2007. Due to the album being leaked ahead of its official March 2008 release, its now been made available on iTunes in Europe, Australia and Japan. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Janelle Monáe is a U.S. singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and performer.

&gt; Monáe was born Janelle Monáe Robinson on 1st December 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas. She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

&gt; A Fine Frenzy is a band led by Alison Sudol (born December 23, 1984 in Seattle, Washington), an American singer, songwriter and pianist. They released their first studio album One Cell In The Sea on July 17, 2007.

&gt; Born in Seattle to dramatic-arts teacher parents, Alison moved to Los Angeles, US at the age of five. With her newly single mother, Alison moved frequently around the city. She developed a strong love for the fantastic literary worlds of CS Lewis, EB White, Lewis Carroll and Charles Dickens, while becoming a passionate author in her own right.

&gt; In an interview with www.spinner.com Alison Sudol shares how she came up with the band's name ""(I) had a bunch of books open on a table, ""a fine frenzy"" jumped off a page of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' [Shakespeare] and it was just right, though every now and then I wonder if it's a bit ... flowery.""

&gt; Alison also immersed herself in classical music, Motown, Aretha Franklin, swing bands, Ella Fitzgerald, Elton John, Louis Armstrong, the Beatles, Technicolor movies and classic 1950's television.

&gt; After teaching herself to play piano, Alison increasingly invested her internal narratives into song form. She found solace in the melodic melancholia of new global British bands Aqualung, Radiohead, Coldplay, Keane, etc... She was also moved by the diatonic minimalism of Philip Glass and the transportive allure of Icelandic music (Björk, Sigur Rós). She graduated from Delphi Academy Los Angeles in 2001. Inspired, Alison Sudol developed the sound of A Fine Frenzy - hypnotic piano arrangements under classic American melody fused into irresistible, atmospheric songs with the power to reach around the world.

&gt; C Duncan (born Christopher Duncan, 29 July 1989) is a Scottish composer and musician. His debut album, Architect, was nominated for the 2015 Mercury Music Prize.

&gt; The son of two classical musicians, he was surrounded by music throughout his childhood. He initially took up piano and viola. His teens led him to school bands – learning to play guitar, bass and drums – but did little to quell his fascination with the composition and performance of classical music. He eventually enrolled in Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland) to study music composition, where his pieces were performed by various ensembles across the UK.

&gt; To hear C Duncan’s music now is to grasp those two common threads between his interests in classical and modern music. The pieces that make up his forthcoming debut LP are formed from lush choral harmonies and acoustic instrumentation, textured like contemporary dreampop and all recorded at home in Glasgow on his bedroom studio setup, gradually built up one layer and one instrument at a time. The results of this methodical and isolationist recording process give us charming lo-fi folk with the harmonic width of choral composition, the sweetness of barbershop and the rough eloquence that has so readily soundtracked Glasgow over the past decades.

&gt; He is also an accomplished painter, naming Grant Wood and Gerhard Richter as influences. His work has been exhibited throughout Scotland and he provides cover art for his own records, expressing the same musical ideas through painted image. Read more on Last.fm.

However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. The first single from the album was called ""Mistress Mabel"" and was released on May 26, 2008. The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd. The Fratellis released a deluxe edition of Here We Stand internationally on December the 8th. The CD includes a new song titled 'Moriarty's Last Stand' and the accompanying DVD includes ""The Year Of The Thief"" (A documentary of the band on the road in the US); A live show filmed on June 18th 2008 at the Fillmore, San Francisco; performances of Milk and Money, Flathead and Mistress Mabel from Abbey Road Studios and the videos for the singles Mistress Mabel and Look Out Sunshine!
On April, 22 2010, both singer Jon Lawler and bassist Barry Wallace posted messages on their forum saying the band are unlikely to record together again soon.

&gt; The Fratellis have announced during June 2012 that they have decided to reform to help raise money for The Eilidh Brown Memorial Fund on the 15th of June at the MacRobert Centre in Stirling. The band plans on announcing more dates for later in the year.
The band then announced an extensive UK tour during December 2012 to take place in April 2013. During the UK tour, 3 more songs were debuted live; ""She's Not Gone Yet (But She's Leaving), Seven Days and Whiskey Saga.
On February 4th 2013, The Fratellis announced they had finished recording their third album, which was revealed to be called We Need Medicine with a release date of October 7th 2013.

I think it's more black and white than people make it out to be. 

&gt; He's still independent, but a great opportunity was presented to him and he took it because it was in his best interest. And his music is still available for free elsewhere (SoundCloud).

Neither of those things make him an independent rapper.

&gt; Technically, he's still independent, just because a huge company is backing him doesn't really change that. Or maybe it does. I'm not even so sure myself where I stand on that, mainly because it's not so much a big deal to me.

If we have to qualify someone's independent status by saying they're *technically* independent, they're probably not independent. Whatever deal Chance has with Apple might not *technically* be a record deal because Apple isn't *technically* a record label, but it's not much different. If there's one thing that can be said about Chance's deal with Apple, it's that it's given him more of a push than any relatively new, up-and-coming independent rapper on the planet has ever been capable of putting together on their own.

&gt; In the end, I think Chance's message is to remain independent for the sake of creative freedom, but I'm sure he wants all indie artists to one day reach the same opportunities he's been giving.

I don't think Chance is necessarily disingenuous with his message, but it's no coincidence that his message &amp; Apple's message are one in the same. 

Chance didn't force the Recording Academy to consider streaming-only albums, Apple did. If *Coloring Book* wasn't the first streaming-only album to chart on Billboard, it would have been some other album by some other Apple-backed artist. **None of this takes anything away from anything Chance has accomplished**, Apple/Jimmy Iovine put their money on him and he succeeded. He probably exceeded their hopes and expectations. That being said, it should be noted that he succeeded with more of a push than any major label could have given a rapper by a corporation bigger than any major label, that has their hand in streaming, internet radio, sales &amp; distribution and that has enough clout to single-handedly change the music industry. Any independent rapper would trade places with Chance in a second, but Chance wouldn't trade places with any of them in a million years. They're just not the same, they're not even in the same ballpark.",,,,gary,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6iudqx,,,,,,,,,,,1498204789.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1499589849.0,,,
t5_2rbaq,,,,False,,,,,,,UofT,,,,,,dj2om81,,,0,,,,Goose89,,,t1_dj2j3tg,3,,,,,,"Honestly, all sorts of concerts; from local indie rock bands to stadium shows at the larger venues we have in Toronto. I recommend you check out the [Soundscapes](http://www.soundscapesmusic.com/tickets-for-sale/) or [Rotate This](http://www.rotate.com/tickets/) websites to see what shows are coming up. Both stores sell hard tickets which is the way to go if you don't want to support Ticketmaster and their sketchy service fees. Just remember to bring cash since they don't take other forms of payment for tickets.

Since I don't know what kind of music you're into, I'll list some of the venues that I think are worth checking out. This list is by no means exhaustive.

**The Horseshoe Tavern** (Queen and Spadina) 
I've mostly seen indie rock bands here. Occasionally punkier stuff. This place is a Toronto gem. It's been around for eons. Artists that have played here include: The Rolling Stones, Willie Nelson, Etta James, The Police, The Ramones. Bands with massive cult followings play here quite often (e.g., My Bloody Valentine played a show there a couple of years ago) which means you get to see legendary acts at a pretty intimate venue. Lots of local bands play here too. Definitely worth checking out.

**The Piston** (Bloor and Ossington)
Local bands that can range anywhere from heavier 90s-inspired rock to blues and folk. 

**Handlebar** (Kensington Market) 
I've seen some cool 60's pop, garage and surf rock bands here. 

**Velvet Underground** (Queen and Portland):
You'll find more electronic stuff here. Mostly ""indie"" stuff as well but the place attracts more DJs. So if you dig synthpop, 80s new wave, post-punky stuff then this is the place to go. They have parties where they play classics by The Smiths, The Cure, Depeche Mode etc. Although most of the events are the sort you'd buy tickets for; you can usually nab one at the door. 

**The Drake** (Queen and Dufferin-ish)
Indie bands in a laid back venue. I've only been here for a few shows but it's in the west end where there are a lot of other places you can hit up for live shows. So it's also got that going for it. 

**The Rex** (Queen and John-ish)
Laid back jazz and blues bar. Lotsa regulars. Definitely worth checking out. This is the sort of place you can randomly pop into.

**Mod Club** (College and Ossington)
Slightly bigger than the venues I mentioned above. I guess the Horseshoe often has bigger deal artists play there but size-wise, this is a bigger venue. It's more so a club than a bar. Not massive but can accommodate larger crowds than the above venues for sure so I guess I'd say it's a midsize venue. I've seen all sorts of stuff here. 

**Danforth Music Hall** and **The Phoenix**:
I'd say these are the best two mid-sized venues in town. Not as big as Rebel (formerly Sound Academy) and certainly nowhere near as big as the massive venues (ACC, Molson Amphitheatre/Budweiser Stage). This is a good thing, in my opinion. You'll find bigger names here. All sorts of genres. This is the sort of place you'd plan an outing to (i.e., buy tickets in advance), rather than randomly hit up.

t5_322sg,,,,False,,,,,,,vidme,,,,,,dj1mjbf,,,0,,,,jeffjusticevideos,,,t1_dj1ioom,1,,,,,,"Thanks for the insight @vidmeduffy - regarding the 50 follower threshold, back when I felt YouTube was a valuable platform I used to think some requirement of followers was a good idea to weed out go-nowhere channels. As it turns out, YouTube now has a ""we will no longer serve ads on YPP videos until the channel reaches 10k lifetime views"" policy. However YouTube, in my humble opinion, is not a helpful platform for small, independent, starting out at home, underdog, amateur, creators as it appears to have preference for big-Hollywood content. And if a creator wants to create political content or engage in legit fair use, it appears as though YT is a hostile place for that. So it seems to be an uphill task to be a YouTube newbiew trying to develop a fan base there. 

Therefore, based on all the videos I've watched on this topic at Vidme and all the comments I've read on the VM reddit, I think a lot of small creators turned to On Vidme, hoping to find new chances of discoverability. 

I think there's room for improvement for VM showing newbies the path to 50. The VM FAQ page is somewhat helpful but a bit hidden and not very extensive. Perhaps VM needs some type of version of YT's Creator Academy. It does not need to be as extensive - just one page. Perhaps you could also embed tutorial videos there by creators like https://vid.me/5nh8 ""Vidme - Getting Started and Verified"" by Roamancing.

At my former YouTube presence I had 10k+ followers and also nearly 3 million views. But at Vidme I am making videos for an entirely different subject matter than my previous YouTube life. Since the subject matter is totally different, it's not applicable to my fan base at my former YT channel. So I am in-effect starting out at a newbie at Vidme. 

I am starting to see several videos and posts by Vidme creators complaining about lack of discoverability and the difficulty hitting the 50 follower requirement. 

It seems to be a catch 22. How do you grow your audience to reach 50 followers if you're new and you have no followers to see your videos? According to the person replying to my email to the Vidme requesting help, some of my videos were being flagged and not showing up on the New page. How can a creator grow an audience if no one sees their videos nowhere on Vidme? If the creator wants to make more content to try to get more attention from viewers, how do they overcome the obstacle of the 3GB upload limit?  

I know posting ""follow for follow"" type comments on other creators channels is not the best method of discoverability but other newbies may not know this and are likely do to it in desperation of trying to get seen. If I watch another creator's videos and post a customized, authentic comment there while trying to cleverly self-promote in a way that's not off-putting, that's all good - but my channel is Walking For Weight Loss and I've found there's very little fitness videos and channels so my ability to reach out to other creators is limited by the newness of Vidme's existence. Obviously it would not make much sense to try to outreach to other creators of channels totally un-related to what I'm creating - like a gaming channel for instance. 

--------------

As it pertains to verification and also discoverability of Vidme new creators, my best proposals regarding how Vidme can best fulfill your goal to build the world's most creator-friendly video community are: 

• Spotlighting creators page 

Vidme could post articles or interviews showcasing creators. This would be an expanded version of YouTube's ""creators on the rise"" concept. If VM cannot afford to hire people for this job at this time, VM could outsource this work to creators and give substantial perks (something like a place on the Picks page for a day) in exchange.

• Spotlighting creators heading on main page 

Working with creators who have regularly scheduled content they could have a heading spotlighting creators releasing new Videos on every day of the week. For example: New Monday Releases: NEW ON MONDAY - Check out commentator Jeff Justice's new video today (next to my video). This heading could feature 2-4 creators per day in a standout way.

• Create collaboration forum page on Vidme

Being able to participate on forums directly at Vidme instead of having to do it elsewhere would lessen the work for creators who are already busy with the duties of numerous roles often as a 1-person crew. Back to that ""creator-friendly video community"" mission, if VM had a forum page on their site instead of or in addition to this reddit page, it would be awesome if you enabled a page similar to the Criagslist gigs page for VM creators to find collaborators. 

For example, let's say I wrote a song and I have the equipment to make a music video - but I can't sign. It would be awesome if I could post a ""Seeking singer collaborator"" post at this hypothetical page on Vidme. 

Also, perhaps the forum could allow for groups similar to the Facebook groups and Google+ groups concepts. 

Sadly, I theorize that algorithms on the major sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ appear to hinder discoverability of self-promoting creators. Therefore it would be wonderful if Vidme provided the opportunity on your very own platform. 

• Creator hierarchy labeling 

VM staff-labeling or community-labeling of a channel's status in a hierarchy - perhaps with labels like ""New creator"" or ""Indie Creator"" or ""Underdog Creator"" or ""Advanced Creator,"" etc... This is a similar concept to YouTube Creator Hub – Benefit Levels.

• Encourage and reward creator mentoring 

Vidme could offer rewards/perks for large creators who mentor smaller channels 

• Creator accounts vs viewer/commenter accounts 

Vidme should distinguish between viewer accounts and creator accounts. I never understood why YouTube and other video venues treated all accounts the same. If a person just wants to be a viewer and/or commenter, then there's no reason to give them all of the features of a regular creator. Just let fans sign up as fans and creators sign up as creators. Of course, if a fan ever wants to be come a creator, enabling that type of profile to turn into a creator profile would be ideal. 

• Allow proof of intent to publish new content on Vidme as alternative to 50 follower requirement 

As an alternative to the 50 follower requirement for new Vidme creators, allow verification applicants to submit proof of a plan to consistently upload new and original content on their platform. An example of proof of the creator's intent to follow though could be them sharing proof they've already created 4-6 videos. I suppose by a screen shot of the video thumbnails. If the creator can prove this, it would seem that should indicate their commitment to Vidme and therefore warrant verification and exemption from the 50 follower requirement.

• Easily verify big creators migrating to VM from other platforms 

Any creator from other video venues with a significant following who applies and commits to exclusively posting on Vidme or at least regularly simultaneously posting new content on Vidme should also warrant verification and exemption from the 50 follower requirement since they already have a track record of demonstrating they know how to build up a fan base.

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD ""Edgy In Brixton"" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London. The DVD contains a full live performance of the debut album Costello Music, B-Sides from various singles and a new song called Pretty Like a Girl. Extras on the DVD include the band being asked questions by members of The Fratellis' website, and on the deluxe edition, highlights from the T In The Park 2007 festival. It was released in the United States on the 30 October 2007

&gt; 2007-2008: Here We Stand

&gt; On November 20, 2007, it was announced on the Fratellis' official website that work had begun on the second album in rehearsal space in Glasgow. The band stated that they are self-producing the album and have their own studio to record in. Recording finished on January 13, 2008.

&gt; On February 22, 2008, they played a small show for fans at Queen Margaret Union to debut new songs from the upcoming album. About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"".

&gt; Life began for Kamasi Washington on February 18, 1981 in Los Angeles, California. In the Washington family music was more of a prerequisite than a privilege. But Kamasi never saw it that way, his love for music began at first sound. His father, Rickey Washington is a professional saxophonist by night and a high school music teacher by day. Kamasi’s mother, Valerie Washington is an accomplished flutist who fell in love with the world of science and became a high school chemistry teacher after her stint as a genetic researcher. By the age of two Kamasi had already began to play the drums and piano, the only thing that kept him away from the wind instruments at that early age was his lack of dental development. He began his exploration into the world of the reeds and brass when he was about seven and his father gave him a clarinet. By the age of twelve Kamasi had found his voice in the form of a tenor saxophone, in fact it was the same saxophone that his father played in high school. 

&gt; Over the next year Kamasi’s development and devotion to music had out grown his academic environment. So he transferred from The Los Angeles Center of Enriched Studies (one the top academic high schools in the nation) and enrolled into the Hamilton High School Music Academy. It was around this time that Kamasi also joined The Multi School Jazz Band (M.S.J.B.), an assembly of the finest young jazz musicians in Los Angeles County and led by Reginald Andrews the same man that taught Kamasi’s father in high school. Because of the sheer vastness of talent that he was surrounded by it was in The Multi School Jazz Band that Kamasi was most inspired during his high school years. Through M.S.J.B. Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi’s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as “The Young Jazz Giants”. 
This fiery group of “Young Giants” wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year “The Young Jazz Giants” had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. 

&gt; After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson’s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album “In My Time” which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi’s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called “Bird Man Records” heard him playing with “The Young Jazz Giants” and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the “big break” for “The Young Jazz Giants” but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after its completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay “ready and waiting” for too long, thus “The Young Jazz Giants” unofficially disbanded. 

&gt; Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called “The Next Step” and that’s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking. 

&gt; (2) Kamasi Washington didn't pick up a saxophone until he was 13 years old, but by that point, he'd been playing several other instruments. That's when he found his calling. Within a couple years, he was the lead tenor saxophonist at Hamilton High School Music Academy in his native Los Angeles. After graduation, he attended UCLA to study ethnomusicology. While enrolled at UCLA, he recorded a self-titled album with Young Jazz Giants, a quartet he had formed with Cameron Graves and brothers Ronald Bruner, Jr. and Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner, released in 2004. From that point, Washington continually performed and recorded with an impressive variety of major artists across several genres, including Snoop Dogg, Raphael Saadiq, Gerald Wilson, McCoy Tyner, George Duke, and PJ Morton. In 2014 alone, Washington demonstrated tremendous range with appearances on Broken Bells' After the Disco, Harvey Mason's Chameleon, Stanley Clarke's Up, and Flying Lotus' You're Dead!, among other albums that covered indie rock, contemporary and progressive jazz, and experimental electronic music. 

&gt;  The following year, Washington contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly and finally debuted as a leader with The Epic, released on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label. An expansive triple album nearly three hours in duration, it involved the other three-quarters of Young Jazz Giants -- by then part of his larger ten piece collective, altnerately known as The Next Step and West Coast Get Down-- string orchestra and choir conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. 

&gt;  The Epic was a critical and commerial success. Not only did it land at number three on the jazz charts, it also found its way on to independent albums and heatseekers charts as well. Washington and his band were not only able to tour the U.S., but to play in Europe and Japan as well. ~ Andy Kellman

&gt; Glen Hansard (born 21 April 1970) is an Irish singer-songwriter and actor. He is vocalist and guitarist for Irish group  The Frames and one half of folk-rock duo The Swell Season.

&gt; Hansard is said to have quit school at age 13 to begin busking on local Dublin streets. He first came to public attention as guitar player 'Outspan Foster' in the Alan Parker film The Commitments, a role he subsequently regretted, believing it distracted from his music career. In 2003 he presented the first series of Other Voices: Songs from a Room, which showcased Irish music talent on RTÉ. The album The Swell Season, in collaboration with a Czech singer and multi-instrumentalist Markéta Irglová, was released on in 2006 (the album also featured Marja Tuhkanen and Bertrand Galen).

&gt; Hansard starred in the movie 'Once' alongside Markéta Irglová which won a prestigious Sundance Audience Award in 2007, as well as the 2008 Academy Award for Best Original Song (for ""Falling Slowly""), beating three songs from the Disney musical ""Enchanted"" and one song from ""August Rush"" (both were heavy contenders). Its Irish release took place on 23rd March 2007 and appeared in cinemas further afield later in the year.

&gt; Hansard's album, Rhythm and Repose, was released in June 2012. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Mission of Burma is an American post-punk band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1979. The band was formed by Roger Miller (guitar), Clint Conley (bass), Peter Prescott (drums) and Martin Swope (tape manipulator/sound engineer). Miller, Conley and Prescott share singing and songwriting duties. Like many of their post-punk contemporaries, Mission of Burma's efforts are largely concerned with extending punk's original vocabulary without losing its essential rebellious spirit. Using rapid shifts in dynamics, unconventional time signatures and chord progressions along with tape effects, Mission of Burma challenges the prevailing idioms of punk while attempting to retain its power and immediacy.

&gt; In early years the band's audience was limited to the Boston area, with all their recordings released on the small Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. The band released only one album in its original form, Vs.. Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope, and has since recorded two more albums, ONoffON and The Obliterati.

&gt; Their wall-of-noise musical sound extended the vocabulary of punk while continuing to hold clear its sense of power and abandon.  They used a number of tape effects, different chord progressions, and time shifts to highlight their formal training in music.  Not only that but they are seen now as a highly influential band to both post-punk and experimental music to come after; many bands cite Burma as an inspiration, including Nirvana, Superchunk, Creed, The Grifters, R.E.M. (who regularly covered ""Academy Fight Song"" on their Green tour), Sonic Youth, Throwing Muses, Yo La Tengo, Soul Asylum, Pixies, Sugar, Catherine Wheel, Guided by Voices, Graham Coxon and Moby - the last two of which have covered """"That's When I Reach For My Revolver.""

&gt; The band were due to tour in 1980 with Joy Division but the suicide of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's singer, canceled the tour. In 1983, after releasing their only full-length studio record Vs., the group disbanded due to Miller's worsening tinnitus.

&gt; The band found increasing relevance throughout the 90s, culminating in the publication of Michael Azzerad's essays Our Band Could Be Your Life which featured Mission of Burma. In 2002, they reunited and began playing reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and formerly Prescott's Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller relates that ""when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin's position, we told him he could use current digital technology which accomplishes Martin's antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted for maintaining the original integrity, and uses a tape deck.""

&gt; Anya Marina is a singer-songwriter and radio disc jockey based in San Diego, Calif. Her music has been featured on the ABC television drama Grey's Anatomy (and its second soundtrack) and on shows such as MTV's The Real World. She is also track 6 on New Moon soundtrack. Anya is a former deejay on KBZT (FM94/9) in San Diego.

&gt; Anya was born in Ann Arbor, Mich., and grew up in the Silicon Valley area of California as a capricious child with Russian-Agnostic/Irish-Catholic professor parents (psychology and russian literature/math) and a younger sister. After finishing high school, Anya moved to Los Angeles as an aspiring actress. With stints in the British American Drama Academy (taught by Richard Dreyfuss, Marsha Mason, Anne Jackson and Eli Wallach) and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Pasadena, Anya has also acted in television and film (in 2001, she starred in the feature film, 100 Girls). She eventually moved back home to earn a college degree in English and writing at Santa Clara University. She continued to struggle as an artist -- working in acting, musical theatre, music, improv and comedy -- but eventually found a job as a radio DJ on KSCU, Santa Clara University's college station.

&gt; After graduating, Anya took a radio station job in San Diego with Mike Halloran at XHRM-FM (92.5). After the station was bought out by another corporation, Halloran hired Anya at Y107 in Los Angeles before they both moved to Premium Radio 92/1 in San Diego's North County. After leaving that station, both disc jockeys landed at FM94/9.

&gt; It was in San Diego that Anya played her first open mic night and began to write her own songs. She quickly developed a live stage act using what she learned as an actress, comic and impressionist. Her recorded debut was a five-song EP called Exercises in Racketeering, which eventually led to a full-length album, Miss Halfway, which was released in early 2005. Anya subsequently opened for such artists as Jason Mraz and Rhett Miller. She was named one of the ""Best Unsigned"" acts by San Diego CityBeat.

&gt; The songs on Miss Halfway talk about her upbringing, ex-boyfriends and all the after-effects. Anya's album was also produced by Scott Russo, the frontman for rockers Unwritten Law, along with Peter King from The Surfers. The record eventually earned a San Diego Music Award for Best Recording. The title track also landed on Grey's Anatomy and was featured as the fifth song on the second Grey's Anatomy (soundtrack) disc along with The Fray, KT Tunstall, Gomez and Snow Patrol.

&gt; The internet radio station KGRL featured her as their Flower-Powered Artist for March of 2007. The feature includes an exclusive interview, CD Review of Miss Halfway, and an on-demand audio stream of an unreleased Anya Marina track titled ""Try It And Like It."" Read more on Last.fm.

#About This Game

They Bleed Pixels is a fiendishly difficult action platformer inspired by H.P. Lovecraft and classic horror. Rendered in a distinct visual style that blends pixel art with paper and ink textures, They Bleed Pixels is a singular mix of intense platforming and fierce beat-em-up action.  At the core of its fighting system is a simple one-button combat scheme with surprising depth and versatility. Button mashing is discouraged while kicking shadowy monsters into saws, pits and spikes is rewarded, thanks to a unique system that lets you earn and place your own checkpoints through stylish kills. The fancier your kills, the faster you fill the checkpoint meter.



 **Story:** 

When a young girl arrives at the Lafcadio Academy for Troubled Young Ladies, she's unprepared for the violent nightmares that plague her dreams and transport her to other worlds.  Worse yet, her dreams are intruding into her waking life, slowly altering her flesh into the demonic form of  her night terrors. Can she destroy the mysterious blood-soaked book that appears to be the root of her troubles or will her transmutation from girl to clawed horror become complete?

#Key Features:

- Extra tight controls: One-button attack system favors skilled combat over complicated combos and button-mashing. Super precise platforming controls let you stop and start on a dime while pulling off gravity-defying dashes and double jumps.



- Eleven massive levels to fight through and explore, each with unique visuals and music. Unlock additional bonus levels and guest levels from indie game developers based on their own creations: They Bleed Ponycorns, They Bleed Stardust, exp.



- Unique checkpoint system rewards fancy kills with a save spot you can carry with you. Hold on to it for extra points or drop it right away to preserve your progress.



- Becoming a monster stabbing master with individual level rankings as well as 150 skill-based achievements. There's lots to aim for after you've completed the game.

- Lush pixel art motion comics tell the story a young girl haunted by eldritch nightmares.



- Original electronic soundtrack by DJ Finish Him (aka Shaun Hatton) composed with synthesizers, unconventional instruments and gadgets often not meant for musical use.

&gt; Age doesn’t necessarily denote musical prowess, but for My American Heart, a band who wrote their debut when most of the members were merely 16, making great music has only been augmented by three years of touring, practice and acquired knowledge. The San Diego fivesome’s dynamic, innovative second record reverberates with a sense of newfound wisdom and the sort of skill that comes only from that hard-earned experience, a reminder of how shockingly young the makers of the record actually are. The strikingly varied disc, metaphorically entitled Hiding Inside the Horrible Weather to denote the beauty that inherently lies in all things, soars from hooky, driving rock (“The Shake (Awful Feeling)” and “Boys! Grab Your Guns”) to introspective acoustic ballad (“Tired and Uninspired”) to expansive searches that reveal a whole new side of My American Heart (“Dangerous” and “Fantasy”). Soliman’s lyrics are noticeably more refined, spinning with clever turns of phrase and poetically-inclined verses- yet another gleaming facet of evident growth on the record.

&gt; Hiding Inside the Horrible Weather is the result of six months of heavy writing time, although some of the album’s tracks come from nearly a year before it was recorded. Following the band’s beloved debut, The Meaning in Makeup, which the group feels was slightly rushed, for this record My American Heart had time to really craft what they consider to be an album that represents how far they have come. “We actually took our time to write this record,” says Soliman. “It was a lot of fun creating this record and expressing ourselves and actually growing as musicians together. Just figuring out what we’re capable of. It was definitely a huge step up from the last record.”

&gt; Armed with new guitarist Matthew VanGasbeck, formerly of Downtown Singapore, who joined the writing process in November, My American Heart entered the studio on February 4th. After whittling down a long list of possible producers, the group chose James Paul Wisner, the producer behind bands like Underoath, The Academy Is and Dashboard Confessional, who Soliman calls the “perfect fit for this record.” In Wisner’s St. Cloud, FL Studio, just south of Orlando, the quintet dove headfirst into an encouraging, creative environment that helped them pen the next tracks to the record. “He helped us really explore ideas and he really listened to the songs,” Barrera notes of the experience. “He was huge part of the record.”

&gt; My American Heart has certainly not eschewed their engaging pop sensibilities, but even former disbelievers won’t be able to deny the range and strength of the songwriting on Hiding Inside the Horrible Weather or the memorability of the tracks, which the band hopes will be drawn to any listener who happens to hear them. As far as huge steps up go, this is a massive one, and the significance of that is not lost on My American Heart. “I just want people to really open their minds to this and give some consideration to how much we’ve grown since the last record,” Soliman says. “We really learned that we are better than what we thought we could be.” Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; This youthful band is a purveyor of a panoramic yet nuanced sound, flowing from intimate to anthemic, the mood from vibrant to contemplative, with frontman Cameron Neal’s lyrics ranging from confessional to metaphorical. The result evokes the wide-open spaces of America’s Midwest but infuses the sense of grit and wonderment with edgier emotions.
Horse Thief originally founded in Denton, TX, moved to Oklahoma City to attend the Academy of Contemporary Music at the University of Central Oklahoma, from which they recently graduated. The band subsequently signed with the Flaming Lips’ management and soon came to the attention of Bella Union. Though Fear In Bliss was conceived at Horse Thief’s Oklahoma headquarters the band decided to record the album in LA, “to leave our comfort zone of Oklahoma”, and producer Thom Monahan (Devendra Banhart, Vetiver) has helped the band fuse their renowned stage performance with studio quality.

&gt; The over-arching theme to Fear In Bliss is “finding yourself and what you believe in, and finding the comfort in acknowledging fear. I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression which comes out a lot on the new album. But when everything gets rough, I think there’s always a way to fix it. The biggest thing for me is to give comfort to people, to shed light on the truth that someone is feeling the same way as them.”

&gt; Life began for Kamasi Washington on February 18, 1981 in Los Angeles, California. In the Washington family music was more of a prerequisite than a privilege. But Kamasi never saw it that way, his love for music began at first sound. His father, Rickey Washington is a professional saxophonist by night and a high school music teacher by day. Kamasi’s mother, Valerie Washington is an accomplished flutist who fell in love with the world of science and became a high school chemistry teacher after her stint as a genetic researcher. By the age of two Kamasi had already began to play the drums and piano, the only thing that kept him away from the wind instruments at that early age was his lack of dental development. He began his exploration into the world of the reeds and brass when he was about seven and his father gave him a clarinet. By the age of twelve Kamasi had found his voice in the form of a tenor saxophone, in fact it was the same saxophone that his father played in high school. 

&gt; Over the next year Kamasi’s development and devotion to music had out grown his academic environment. So he transferred from The Los Angeles Center of Enriched Studies (one the top academic high schools in the nation) and enrolled into the Hamilton High School Music Academy. It was around this time that Kamasi also joined The Multi School Jazz Band (M.S.J.B.), an assembly of the finest young jazz musicians in Los Angeles County and led by Reginald Andrews the same man that taught Kamasi’s father in high school. Because of the sheer vastness of talent that he was surrounded by it was in The Multi School Jazz Band that Kamasi was most inspired during his high school years. Through M.S.J.B. Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi’s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as “The Young Jazz Giants”. 
This fiery group of “Young Giants” wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year “The Young Jazz Giants” had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. 

&gt; After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson’s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album “In My Time” which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi’s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called “Bird Man Records” heard him playing with “The Young Jazz Giants” and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the “big break” for “The Young Jazz Giants” but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after its completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay “ready and waiting” for too long, thus “The Young Jazz Giants” unofficially disbanded. 

&gt; Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called “The Next Step” and that’s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking. 

&gt; (2) Kamasi Washington didn't pick up a saxophone until he was 13 years old, but by that point, he'd been playing several other instruments. That's when he found his calling. Within a couple years, he was the lead tenor saxophonist at Hamilton High School Music Academy in his native Los Angeles. After graduation, he attended UCLA to study ethnomusicology. While enrolled at UCLA, he recorded a self-titled album with Young Jazz Giants, a quartet he had formed with Cameron Graves and brothers Ronald Bruner, Jr. and Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner, released in 2004. From that point, Washington continually performed and recorded with an impressive variety of major artists across several genres, including Snoop Dogg, Raphael Saadiq, Gerald Wilson, McCoy Tyner, George Duke, and PJ Morton. In 2014 alone, Washington demonstrated tremendous range with appearances on Broken Bells' After the Disco, Harvey Mason's Chameleon, Stanley Clarke's Up, and Flying Lotus' You're Dead!, among other albums that covered indie rock, contemporary and progressive jazz, and experimental electronic music. 

&gt;  The following year, Washington contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly and finally debuted as a leader with The Epic, released on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label. An expansive triple album nearly three hours in duration, it involved the other three-quarters of Young Jazz Giants -- by then part of his larger ten piece collective, altnerately known as The Next Step and West Coast Get Down-- string orchestra and choir conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. 

&gt;  The Epic was a critical and commerial success. Not only did it land at number three on the jazz charts, it also found its way on to independent albums and heatseekers charts as well. Washington and his band were not only able to tour the U.S., but to play in Europe and Japan as well. ~ Andy Kellman

Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi’s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as “The Young Jazz Giants”. 
This fiery group of “Young Giants” wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year “The Young Jazz Giants” had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. 

&gt; After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson’s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album “In My Time” which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi’s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called “Bird Man Records” heard him playing with “The Young Jazz Giants” and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the “big break” for “The Young Jazz Giants” but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after its completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay “ready and waiting” for too long, thus “The Young Jazz Giants” unofficially disbanded. 

&gt; Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called “The Next Step” and that’s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking. 

&gt; (2) Kamasi Washington didn't pick up a saxophone until he was 13 years old, but by that point, he'd been playing several other instruments. That's when he found his calling. Within a couple years, he was the lead tenor saxophonist at Hamilton High School Music Academy in his native Los Angeles. After graduation, he attended UCLA to study ethnomusicology. While enrolled at UCLA, he recorded a self-titled album with Young Jazz Giants, a quartet he had formed with Cameron Graves and brothers Ronald Bruner, Jr. and Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner, released in 2004. From that point, Washington continually performed and recorded with an impressive variety of major artists across several genres, including Snoop Dogg, Raphael Saadiq, Gerald Wilson, McCoy Tyner, George Duke, and PJ Morton. In 2014 alone, Washington demonstrated tremendous range with appearances on Broken Bells' After the Disco, Harvey Mason's Chameleon, Stanley Clarke's Up, and Flying Lotus' You're Dead!, among other albums that covered indie rock, contemporary and progressive jazz, and experimental electronic music. 

&gt;  The following year, Washington contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly and finally debuted as a leader with The Epic, released on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label. An expansive triple album nearly three hours in duration, it involved the other three-quarters of Young Jazz Giants -- by then part of his larger ten piece collective, altnerately known as The Next Step and West Coast Get Down-- string orchestra and choir conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. 

&gt;  The Epic was a critical and commerial success. Not only did it land at number three on the jazz charts, it also found its way on to independent albums and heatseekers charts as well. Washington and his band were not only able to tour the U.S., but to play in Europe and Japan as well. ~ Andy Kellman

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

Septa, our public transport, it actually really developed as far as places you can get to/from via the bus, trolly, or ""el"". The service...well...isn't incredible. It's a little grimy at times, but will definitely get you around. For the bus, el, and trolly, it's $2.25 a person each way. You could get the ""Independent Pass"" which is like 11 bucks and you can take almost all of the transportation for a day (unlimited). Here's their trip planner site: http://www.septa.org/service/trip-planner.html  

But I'd honestly, look into Lyft, depending on your budget. Your days are nicely planned since they sort of pocket certain parts of the city, and honestly you could walk from/to a lot of these places if you're able to. In addition, we have sort of bike rental stations situated throughout the city, which can be picked up in front of the art museum and dropped off at another locations. Here's the link to that: https://www.rideindego.com/ 

For example, for Day 1, you could take a lyft from the garden to boathouse row for probably $10. I'm not sure if there's a bus route that would get you there. You'll spend a little more then Septa, but you'll save time waiting for the bus and what not. You can walk down to the art museum steps/rocky statue from there (~10 minutes) and to the Easter state penn from there (~10 minutes). UPenn would be kind of a hike. I walk from the art museum area to upenn area for work, and it's about 30 mins (~1.5 miles). But you get the gist. We're a very walkable city, so I would look into how far each place is for the rest of the day and see if you're comfortable with that much walking. 

Places to stay are tricky, you're going to end up spending a pretty penny if you stay in the Center City area. I'm not super familiar with the hotels since I live here, but I'd honestly take a look at AirBnB to see if there's anything reasonable on there, plus it's a fun way to meet some philly folks.

**Day 1**: Definitely check out the back of the art museum. There's a bunch of gazebos you can sit under and look at the river and out onto boat house row. 

**Eating:** Spot Burger in Brewerytown. Honestly, the most delicious burgers and fries. Josh - the owner - is the coolest dude. The area is a bitch sketchy, so if you're nervous about that sort of thing, might be best to go elsewhere. By the eastern state penn. there's a ton of restaurants on fairmount street. I'd look into La Calaca Feliz (mexican), RyBread (sandwiches/salads), or Zorba's Tavern (greek). UPenn/Drexel has some really solid food truck options available. Magic Carper (vegetarian), Dos Hermanos (mexican), pretty much anyone off the street. If you're interested in these, let me know and I can give general addresses - but they are not always there. 

**Drinking:** By eastern state: Jacks Firehouse for a solid cocktail, Bar Hygge for home brewed beer, Bishop's Collar for a dive, and La Calaca Feliz for margaritas. By UPenn/Drexel: World Cafe Live has VERY good martinis and usually some cool live music, Slainte for your typical Irish pub. 

**Day 2**: 

**Eating**: Reading terminal has so many food places, I would just spend all day there eating. Definitely check out: Beiler's Donuts, Dienner's BBQ Chicken, Bassets Ice Cream, DiNics (roast port with sharp prov.) The Original Turkey. This really depends on what you're in the mood for. It's quite chaotic during lunch, so give yourself some time to wonder around. By the Academy of music, there's so many restaurants: El Vez (pricey, but delicious mexican and a really cool old timey photo booth), Green Eggs Cafe for brunch (usually PACKED), and my favorite restaurant in the whole city Bud &amp; Marylins (100% get the cheese curds and hot buns)

**Drinking**: Bud &amp; Marylins, Good Dog Bar (deceptively cool for a very divey looking bar), Yakitori boy (karaoke!), Raven Lounge (very divey bar).

**Day 3**

**Eating**: Franklin Fountain (homemade ice cream), Shane's Confectionary (right next store to Franlin Fountain, cute little old time-y candy shop) Capofitto (gelato and pizza), DiNics seafood, The Victoria Freehouse (British). 

**Drinking**: Independence Hall has a Beer Garden every year - pretty lil place, Spruce Street Harbor is tons of fun (hammocks to lounge, drinking, carnivaly food and a great place to see the old Ben Franklin), Kyber Pass Pub (looks straight out of Harry Potter), Cuba Libre (rum bar - tons of dancing).

**Other**: Ritz movie theaters play some cool indie flicks, and is a relief from the heat.  

More on the city's beer gardens: http://www.visitphilly.com/itineraries/philadelphia/the-best-beer-gardens-in-philadelphia/

Just as a side note, I'm not sure how the heat effects your hometown, but the heat in philly can be honestly, fucking brutal. It's incredibly humid and hot, so definitely pack light clothes that you don't mind sweating through and a bottle for 10000 oz of water (wooder).

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD ""Edgy In Brixton"" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London. The DVD contains a full live performance of the debut album Costello Music, B-Sides from various singles and a new song called Pretty Like a Girl. Extras on the DVD include the band being asked questions by members of The Fratellis' website, and on the deluxe edition, highlights from the T In The Park 2007 festival. It was released in the United States on the 30 October 2007

&gt; 2007-2008: Here We Stand

&gt; On November 20, 2007, it was announced on the Fratellis' official website that work had begun on the second album in rehearsal space in Glasgow. The band stated that they are self-producing the album and have their own studio to record in. Recording finished on January 13, 2008.

&gt; On February 22, 2008, they played a small show for fans at Queen Margaret Union to debut new songs from the upcoming album. About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. The first single from the album was called ""Mistress Mabel"" and was released on May 26, 2008. The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd. The Fratellis released a deluxe edition of Here We Stand internationally on December the 8th. The CD includes a new song titled 'Moriarty's Last Stand' and the accompanying DVD includes ""The Year Of The Thief"" (A documentary of the band on the road in the US); A live show filmed on June 18th 2008 at the Fillmore, San Francisco; performances of Milk and Money, Flathead and Mistress Mabel from Abbey Road Studios and the videos for the singles Mistress Mabel and Look Out Sunshine!

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

&gt; Mission of Burma is an American post-punk band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1979. The band was formed by Roger Miller (guitar), Clint Conley (bass), Peter Prescott (drums) and Martin Swope (tape manipulator/sound engineer). Miller, Conley and Prescott share singing and songwriting duties. Like many of their post-punk contemporaries, Mission of Burma's efforts are largely concerned with extending punk's original vocabulary without losing its essential rebellious spirit. Using rapid shifts in dynamics, unconventional time signatures and chord progressions along with tape effects, Mission of Burma challenges the prevailing idioms of punk while attempting to retain its power and immediacy.

&gt; In early years the band's audience was limited to the Boston area, with all their recordings released on the small Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. The band released only one album in its original form, Vs.. Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope, and has since recorded two more albums, ONoffON and The Obliterati.

&gt; Their wall-of-noise musical sound extended the vocabulary of punk while continuing to hold clear its sense of power and abandon.  They used a number of tape effects, different chord progressions, and time shifts to highlight their formal training in music.  Not only that but they are seen now as a highly influential band to both post-punk and experimental music to come after; many bands cite Burma as an inspiration, including Nirvana, Superchunk, Creed, The Grifters, R.E.M. (who regularly covered ""Academy Fight Song"" on their Green tour), Sonic Youth, Throwing Muses, Yo La Tengo, Soul Asylum, Pixies, Sugar, Catherine Wheel, Guided by Voices, Graham Coxon and Moby - the last two of which have covered """"That's When I Reach For My Revolver.""

&gt; The band were due to tour in 1980 with Joy Division but the suicide of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's singer, canceled the tour. In 1983, after releasing their only full-length studio record Vs., the group disbanded due to Miller's worsening tinnitus.

&gt; The band found increasing relevance throughout the 90s, culminating in the publication of Michael Azzerad's essays Our Band Could Be Your Life which featured Mission of Burma. In 2002, they reunited and began playing reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and formerly Prescott's Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller relates that ""when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin's position, we told him he could use current digital technology which accomplishes Martin's antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted for maintaining the original integrity, and uses a tape deck.""

&gt; Glen Hansard (born 21 April 1970) is an Irish singer-songwriter and actor. He is vocalist and guitarist for Irish group  The Frames and one half of folk-rock duo The Swell Season.

&gt; Hansard is said to have quit school at age 13 to begin busking on local Dublin streets. He first came to public attention as guitar player 'Outspan Foster' in the Alan Parker film The Commitments, a role he subsequently regretted, believing it distracted from his music career. In 2003 he presented the first series of Other Voices: Songs from a Room, which showcased Irish music talent on RTÉ. The album The Swell Season, in collaboration with a Czech singer and multi-instrumentalist Markéta Irglová, was released on in 2006 (the album also featured Marja Tuhkanen and Bertrand Galen).

&gt; Hansard starred in the movie 'Once' alongside Markéta Irglová which won a prestigious Sundance Audience Award in 2007, as well as the 2008 Academy Award for Best Original Song (for ""Falling Slowly""), beating three songs from the Disney musical ""Enchanted"" and one song from ""August Rush"" (both were heavy contenders). Its Irish release took place on 23rd March 2007 and appeared in cinemas further afield later in the year.

&gt; Hansard's album, Rhythm and Repose, was released in June 2012. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; An award-winning, internationally successful duo comprising identical siblings Tegan and Sara Quin, Tegan and Sara first burst onto the Canadian music scene in 1998, when they earned the highest score in history at Calgary's Garage Warz competition; their quick rise didn't stop, for their melodic acoustics and charming stage personas led to a slew of dates with Sarah McLachlan's Lilith Fair that same year and a record deal with Neil Young's Vapor Records in April 2000. Natives of Calgary, the twin sisters derived their music interests from their parents. Tegan and Sara began playing piano at age eight, and in their teens they were playing in their own punk bands. This Business of Art, which was produced by singer/songwriter Hawksley Workman, marked their debut in mid-2000, and a summer tour with Neil Young and the Pretenders followed in July. Two years later, Tegan and Sara released If It Was You, followed in 2004 by their commercial breakthrough, So Jealous. In 2005, the White Stripes released a popular cover of If It Was You's ""Walking with a Ghost."" That same year saw the duo touring the U.S. with the Killers and landing seven songs in the popular TV medical drama Grey's Anatomy. In 2007, Tegan sang backup on a song on new Sire labelmate Against Me!'s album New Wave, and the twins, who had by then moved far from the singer/songwriter mold and were more interested in exploring pop, punk, and indie rock, came out with The Con, produced by Christopher Walla of Death Cab for Cutie. Working with Walla went well, and Tegan and Sara also utilized his production skills on their next album, 2009's Sainthood. The year 2009 also found the duo collaborating with Tiësto on the song ""Feel It in My Bones"" for his Kaleidoscope album and with comedian Margaret Cho on the track ""Intervention"" from her Cho Dependent release. Arriving in 2011, the live CD/DVD Get Along was paired with three short behind-the-scenes films called States, India, and For the Most Part. On their seventh studio album, Tegan and Sara turned to producer Greg Kurstin (Lily Allen, Kelly Clarkson, Ke$ha) for help in making an album that reflected the modern pop sound. The very slick yet still emotionally powerful Heartthrob was released in early 2013 to almost universal critical acclaim, topping the charts in over a dozen countries and earning three Juno Awards and a Polaris Music Prize nomination. They next appeared singing the theme song to 2014's Lego Movie. Recorded with the Lonely Planet, ""Everything Is Awesome"" was certified gold and nominated for an Academy Award. Their next album, 2016's Love You to Death, was again produced by Kurstin and found the sisters delving even deeper into radio pop. ~ MacKenzie Wilson

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

&gt; A Fine Frenzy is a band led by Alison Sudol (born December 23, 1984 in Seattle, Washington), an American singer, songwriter and pianist. They released their first studio album One Cell In The Sea on July 17, 2007.

&gt; Born in Seattle to dramatic-arts teacher parents, Alison moved to Los Angeles, US at the age of five. With her newly single mother, Alison moved frequently around the city. She developed a strong love for the fantastic literary worlds of CS Lewis, EB White, Lewis Carroll and Charles Dickens, while becoming a passionate author in her own right.

&gt; In an interview with www.spinner.com Alison Sudol shares how she came up with the band's name ""(I) had a bunch of books open on a table, ""a fine frenzy"" jumped off a page of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' [Shakespeare] and it was just right, though every now and then I wonder if it's a bit ... flowery.""

&gt; Alison also immersed herself in classical music, Motown, Aretha Franklin, swing bands, Ella Fitzgerald, Elton John, Louis Armstrong, the Beatles, Technicolor movies and classic 1950's television.

&gt; After teaching herself to play piano, Alison increasingly invested her internal narratives into song form. She found solace in the melodic melancholia of new global British bands Aqualung, Radiohead, Coldplay, Keane, etc... She was also moved by the diatonic minimalism of Philip Glass and the transportive allure of Icelandic music (Björk, Sigur Rós). She graduated from Delphi Academy Los Angeles in 2001. Inspired, Alison Sudol developed the sound of A Fine Frenzy - hypnotic piano arrangements under classic American melody fused into irresistible, atmospheric songs with the power to reach around the world.

&gt; Janelle Monáe is a U.S. singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and performer.

&gt; Monáe was born Janelle Monáe Robinson on 1st December 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas. She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

&gt; Life began for Kamasi Washington on February 18, 1981 in Los Angeles, California. In the Washington family music was more of a prerequisite than a privilege. But Kamasi never saw it that way, his love for music began at first sound. His father, Rickey Washington is a professional saxophonist by night and a high school music teacher by day. Kamasi’s mother, Valerie Washington is an accomplished flutist who fell in love with the world of science and became a high school chemistry teacher after her stint as a genetic researcher. By the age of two Kamasi had already began to play the drums and piano, the only thing that kept him away from the wind instruments at that early age was his lack of dental development. He began his exploration into the world of the reeds and brass when he was about seven and his father gave him a clarinet. By the age of twelve Kamasi had found his voice in the form of a tenor saxophone, in fact it was the same saxophone that his father played in high school. 

&gt; Over the next year Kamasi’s development and devotion to music had out grown his academic environment. So he transferred from The Los Angeles Center of Enriched Studies (one the top academic high schools in the nation) and enrolled into the Hamilton High School Music Academy. It was around this time that Kamasi also joined The Multi School Jazz Band (M.S.J.B.), an assembly of the finest young jazz musicians in Los Angeles County and led by Reginald Andrews the same man that taught Kamasi’s father in high school. Because of the sheer vastness of talent that he was surrounded by it was in The Multi School Jazz Band that Kamasi was most inspired during his high school years. Through M.S.J.B. Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi’s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as “The Young Jazz Giants”. 
This fiery group of “Young Giants” wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year “The Young Jazz Giants” had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. 

&gt; After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson’s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album “In My Time” which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi’s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called “Bird Man Records” heard him playing with “The Young Jazz Giants” and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the “big break” for “The Young Jazz Giants” but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after its completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay “ready and waiting” for too long, thus “The Young Jazz Giants” unofficially disbanded. 

&gt; Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called “The Next Step” and that’s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking. 

&gt; (2) Kamasi Washington didn't pick up a saxophone until he was 13 years old, but by that point, he'd been playing several other instruments. That's when he found his calling. Within a couple years, he was the lead tenor saxophonist at Hamilton High School Music Academy in his native Los Angeles. After graduation, he attended UCLA to study ethnomusicology. While enrolled at UCLA, he recorded a self-titled album with Young Jazz Giants, a quartet he had formed with Cameron Graves and brothers Ronald Bruner, Jr. and Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner, released in 2004. From that point, Washington continually performed and recorded with an impressive variety of major artists across several genres, including Snoop Dogg, Raphael Saadiq, Gerald Wilson, McCoy Tyner, George Duke, and PJ Morton. In 2014 alone, Washington demonstrated tremendous range with appearances on Broken Bells' After the Disco, Harvey Mason's Chameleon, Stanley Clarke's Up, and Flying Lotus' You're Dead!, among other albums that covered indie rock, contemporary and progressive jazz, and experimental electronic music. 

&gt;  The following year, Washington contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly and finally debuted as a leader with The Epic, released on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label. An expansive triple album nearly three hours in duration, it involved the other three-quarters of Young Jazz Giants -- by then part of his larger ten piece collective, altnerately known as The Next Step and West Coast Get Down-- string orchestra and choir conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. 

&gt;  The Epic was a critical and commerial success. Not only did it land at number three on the jazz charts, it also found its way on to independent albums and heatseekers charts as well. Washington and his band were not only able to tour the U.S., but to play in Europe and Japan as well. ~ Andy Kellman

&gt; The time is now for one of the industry’s best-kept secrets: PJ Morton. The Maroon 5 keyboardist/ backing vocalist makes his major label debut on May 14 with New Orleans, his first album for Young Money Entertainment/Cash Money Records. One listen to Morton’s anticipated project quickly reveals why the multi-talent became a favorite on the indie R&amp;B circuit and an in-demand songwriter/producer and also why the limitless talent will be a game changer for the Lil Wayne-founded Young Money.

&gt; New Orleans marks the Cash Money imprint’s first step toward broadening its already wide appeal, thanks to a hit-making and award-winning roster that includes founder Lil Wayne, Drake and Nicki Minaj. And there’s no better ambassador to musically personify that message than Morton, whose self described “soulful pop” seamlessly spans multiple genres from gospel and R&amp;B/funk to pop and rock.

&gt; “I’ve always pushed boundaries,” says Morton, “but I always remain true to who I am musically. New Orleans is a natural progression of who I am. I can’t explain it except through my music. That proves it better than anything I can say.”

&gt; Building that case is “Only One” featuring Stevie Wonder. Quickly garnering strong reaction following its January premiere on Billboard.com, the song is the lead single from New Orleans. Armed with an infectious hook and a head-boppin’ groove, the up-tempo number showcases Morton’s velvety tenor, songwriting skills and musicianship, accented by Wonder’s distinctive harmonica.

&gt; “Stevie joining me on the track is the ultimate start. It’s my dream come true,” says Morton of teaming with Wonder. “I want to continue the legacy he represents: musicianship and positivity.”

&gt; New Orleans itself stems from Morton’s acclaimed 2012 EP, Following My First Mind, featuring guest cameos from Maroon 5’s Adam Levine, Lil Wayne and Jazmine Sullivan. A nod to Morton’s hometown and musical roots, the forthcoming New Orleans finds Morton at the keyboard playing with a full backing band complete with horns and strings. The result is a lush, melodic yet organic 10-track set that grabs listeners right from the opening title track.

&gt; “New Orleans is where I learned how to play music,” recalls Morton. “It’s the physical and mind space I was in when I fell in love with music. It wasn’t about marketing, radio and publicity. It was just about making music because I loved it. It made me feel good. Young Money wanted me creatively as I am. That’s why I’m excited about this next chapter.”

&gt; Also featuring rapper Busta Rhymes, New Orleans comes packed with a diverse slate of musical influences. There’s the reggae-infused “Hard Enough,” which explores relationship issues. “I’m looking for a love unconditional / Not one that goes wherever the wind blows,” declares Morton as the song opens.

&gt; The self-described “Dr. Love” traverses the same landscape on the mid-tempo “Work It Out.” Set off by a touch of synth and a hypnotic drumbeat, the song once again spotlights Morton’s tantalizing tenor. Also noteworthy is “Heavy,” a song revamped from Morton’s 2012 EP and featuring Adam Levine. Sporting a funk/rock track reminiscent of Sly Stone and Prince, the song’s lyrics were inspired by Morton’s frustration at one point with his indie career.

&gt; “It was at a point where I was trying to figure out what the next step was,” says Morton, who hadn’t yet connected with pop hitmakers Maroon 5. “This was me getting those feelings out. Since that frustration, I’ve had one of the biggest years in my career. It’s crazy.”

&gt; Influenced by acts ranging from the Beatles and James Taylor to Wonder and Donny Hathaway, the New Orleans native is the son of gospel singer Paul S. Morton. His formal foray into the industry was as a member of the band Freestyle Nation, which debuted in the early 2000s. But it was as a songwriter/ producer that Morton left his first indelible impression. He won a Grammy Award for his songwriting/ production of India.Arie’s “Interested” from her 2002 album Voyage to India.

&gt; That opened the door to more collaborations (Jermaine Dupri, LL Cool J, Monica, Musiq Soulchild, Trinitee 5:7) and additional accolades (Dove and Stellar Awards) for his work with gospel singer DeWayne Woods. Woods’ “Let Go, Let God” spent a record 70 weeks on the gospel chart. Along the way, Morton released several acclaimed indie solo albums. He also attracted the attention of Academy Award-winning producer AR Rahman (“Slumdog Millionaire”), who asked Morton to contribute a song (“Sajna”) to the soundtrack for the Vince Vaughn comedy “Couples Retreat.”

&gt; Morton’s next big break occurred three years ago, when he was asked to audition by friend and Maroon
5 music director Adam Blackstone for a spot in the band as its keyboardist/vocalist. Soon after, childhood friend and Young Money Entertainment president Mack Maine championed Morton’s music and vision to Cash Money co-CEO’s Roland “Slim” Williams and Bryan “Birdman” Williams. With Lil Wayne co-signing his approval as well, Morton is ready to bring his journey full circle with New Orleans.

&gt; “My indie years and working with various artists, including Maroon 5, have helped me understand who I am as both an individual and an artist,” says Morton. “It has allowed me to create a fan base that will forever be with me. Now I’m being given the opportunity to do on steroids what I’ve been doing for years.” Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Geoffroy is the main man of the Mugwump project. Initiated by him and initially working with fellow Belgians Spirit Catcher, Mugwump now welcomes Olivier Grégoire aka Kolombo as his main partner plus fellow producer and Academy alumni Compuphonic. At the helm of the Belgian House scene since the crazy days of his 8 year long residency at Belgium's mythic Food Club, Geoffroy has upped his international profile with a series of compilations including the ""Moving House"" series on SSR. On top, he is also running his own 12"" labels Hi-Phen and Suicide - the later being a joint venture with the mighty Eskimo imprint from Ghent. His djing style is pretty eclectic, electronic and surprising, but he's always favouring an open-minded approach. When it comes to it, he remains always faithful at one big and simple idea: fusion. From electronic and modern House grooves to funky minimalism or deep Techno with a big dash of Cosmic/Balearic/Disco stuff. Like Belgian chocolate, it can be sweet or bitter or both at the same time. Most recently Geoffroy has really been shaping the Mugwump moniker with an impressive list of remixes for the likes of Crosstown Rebels, Brique Rouge, Eskimo, Bob Sinclar, Tim Paris, Azuli, Snax/Shapemod and his night, ""Flesh"" at Brussels legendary Fuse Club has just recently been quoted as one of Mixmags's 50 best clubs in the world.

&gt; Janelle Monáe is a U.S. singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and performer.

&gt; Monáe was born Janelle Monáe Robinson on 1st December 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas. She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

&gt; Temposhark are an English electronic rock band, formed in London, UK and Brighton by singer and songwriter Robert Diament. Temposhark are best known for their songs Bye Bye Baby, Joy, It's Better To Have Loved and Not That Big, a duet with singer Imogen Heap, which is featured on their 2008 debut album The Invisible Line. Other notable artist collaborations include Guy Sigsworth, Sean McGhee, Youth (aka Martin Glover from Killing Joke), Kate Havnevik and the virtuoso violinist Sophie Solomon. Their second album 'Threads' was released in 2010.

&gt; Diament set up his own UK record label in December 2004 called Paper and Glue releasing a series of limited edition Temposhark singles, the first of which was their critically acclaimed EP Neon Question Mark. 

&gt; Temposhark quickly collaborated with singer Imogen Heap (Frou Frou), received club remixes from electro pioneers including Cursor Miner, Mark Moore (S'Express), Melnyk, Metronomy, Avril (FCommunications), Carmen Rizzo and Crispin J Glover as well as hip-hop crew Border Crossing, Masashi Naka (Escalator Records, Japan), Akira the Don and electropunk duo Noblesse Oblige. The band have also written two short film soundtracks for fine artist Justine Pearsall.

&gt; A second EP 'Invisible Ink/Little White Lie' came out in May 2005 which attracted many new admirers including acclaimed producer Guy Sigsworth, best known for his work with Madonna, Björk and Britney Spears. Sigsworth went on to produce Temposhark's first nationwide released UK single It's Better To Have Loved, which came out as a limited edition CD on December 12th 2005. All of these early Temposhark limited edition EPs came in deluxe packaging helping to create a buzz around the band in creative circles and with their fanbase. The band themselves were never pictured on the sleeves instead choosing striking original art images and stylish die-cut record sleeves.

&gt; In 2005, Diament said that his band name was thought up when he ""woke up in the midst of a dream one night, at like 4am, and just said the word Temposhark. So it came from my subconscious I guess. Honestly it was that simple. I wanted a name that sounded strong. I liked the idea that music could be a weapon. Something powerful..""

&gt; In May 2006 Temposhark released their second nationwide single Joy on limited edition CD and 7” vinyl and the band set out on a UK tour visiting towns all over the UK. These dates included a very high profile London show at Tate Britain on Fri May 5th and Carling Academy Islington on Sat May 20th. Temposhark gained many new fans when Joy was featured on the front homepage of iTunes UK and in iTunes’ weekly newsletter.

&gt; In 2007, Temposhark toured the USA with their full band as well as completing their debut album, to be released in March 2008.

&gt; Temposhark's debut album The Invisible Line will be released in Spring 2008 in both UK and USA/Canada. It was produced and recorded in London by rising producer Sean McGhee with two tracks produced by Guy Sigsworth. The album includes the song Blame, which was co-written with legendary producer Youth aka Martin Glover from Killing Joke as well as a duet with Imogen Heap called Not That Big.

&gt; On March 15th 2007 at the South by Southwest 2007 festival, Temposhark announced on stage that their debut album was to be called The Invisible Line. Singer Robert Diament has said that the album title was inspired by controversial British artist Tracey Emin from passages in her books Exploration Of The Soul (1994) and Strangeland (2005).

&gt; A behind-the-scenes video of Temposhark recording at London's RAK Studios was released on YouTube.com on May 26th 2007. The video was synced up to the full album version of the Temposhark song Blame. This is thought to be the first preview of the newly recorded album version of the song.

&gt; In October 2007, Temposhark's song Blame, taken from their forthcoming album, was nominated in the Best International category at the Ontario Independent Music Awards which take place in Toronto, Canada on November 15th 2007. Due to the album being leaked ahead of its official March 2008 release, its now been made available on iTunes in Europe, Australia and Japan. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; The Murmurs were an American alternative pop music duo composed of singers/songwriters Leisha Hailey and Heather Grody. They began performing in 1991 while the duo were both students of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. With their self-released, debut album, Who We Are, the duo quickly attracted a cult following on the East Village club circuit. In 1994, The Murmurs signed with MCA Records. They released their self-titled LP the same year. The duo expanded into a four-woman group in 1997 with the addition of bassist Sheri Ozeki and drummer Sherri Solinger. They released Pristine Smut in 1997 and, a year later, Blender.

&gt; Hailey and Grody rejoined in 2001 as a new band entitled Gush. But the band Gush later split up due to Hailey's busy acting schedule.

&gt; In 2007 Leisha Hailey started another band called Uh Huh Her with Camila Grey and Alicia Warrington.

&gt; As of now Uh Huh Her consists of Leisha Hailey and Camila Grey. Read more on Last.fm.

It sounds too good to be true: You order an item, and someone hand-delivers the package within a few hours. How is this possible? Amazon Prime Now usually works like this. You can order a product by noon and expect to receive it by 9 p.m, sometimes even within an hour. It's only available in some cities and towns.  Learn more about same-day delivery.

Share Benefits With Others

There you were, enjoying the rewards of an Amazon Prime membership. Then you moved in with your significant other, who also orders a lot of stuff online. You can share the same Prime Membership with two other adults in the same household. To share your Amazon Prime membership, go to Account Settings &gt;&gt; Manage Your Content and Devices &gt;&gt; Settings &gt;&gt; Holds and Family Library &gt;&gt; Invite Adult.

Tip in a Tip: Shopping on Amazon the right way is more than clicking items and loading up your cart. Once you learn a few tricks, you’ll find sales and price cuts that you never imagined possible. Five insider secrets to save money on Amazon.com.

Watch Streaming Video

Amazon Studios gained global attention at the 2017 Academy Awards when Casey Affleck won Best Actor for “Manchester by the Sea.” Like Netflix and Hulu, Amazon is producing a wide range of high-quality programs, and critics are giving the retail giant a big thumb’s up.

However, Amazon also offers a colossal library of movies and TV series, from HBO flagships like “The Wire” to indie films like “The Lobster.” Keep in mind, not every flick or episode is available for free, but you can easily buy or order a streaming version of almost any movie imaginable. You can also download certain titles to watch offline. Here are the steps on how to do this.

Download Free Music

Many people enjoy their first year of Prime membership without ever knowing they can download music for free. That’s right: download. Yes, you can also stream songs, the same way you stream music on Apple Music, Spotify, and Pandora, but you can also choose from more than a million mp3s to keep forever on your phone or computer.

The Prime Music app is also a handy tool. You can upload your own music library and listen to your songs wherever you go.

Read Free Books And Magazines

Reed Saxon, AP

Amazon started as an online bookstore, so it’s no wonder that the mega-store would nod to its roots with free volumes on Kindle. Amazon Prime reading offers you a trove of ebooks, comics, and magazines, which you can download at no charge to pretty much any device.

The service works just like Prime Video, where the selections rotate regularly. So if the book you want to read isn’t there now, it maybe become available in a few months. Just download the Kindle app and you should ready to read. Verbophiles can even use the built-in dictionary to look up unfamiliar words

Use Special Cloud Storage

The truth is scary: Many people still don’t back up their hard drives. These folks are always one man-made or natural disaster away from losing all their pictures, music, videos, and documents. If you don’t already have a dependable storage service but you do have a Prime membership, you can use Amazon’s handy Cloud Drive, which gives members 5GB of storage for music and videos.

Even better: You can use Amazon Prints to turn some of those stored photos into beautiful, frame-worthy images. Find out how to print high-quality photos for cheap.

Order Food And Domestic Goods

Imagine walking into a supermarket, picking up a box, and filling it with 45 pounds of groceries. Okay, now imagine that you don’t even visit the supermarket, but someone deliveries this box directly to your door. Sound fantastic? Well, that’s basically what Amazon Pantry does. For $5.99, Amazon will ship a box of individual household items you select, up to 45 pounds.

The service is still working out its kinks, so you won’t find the same selection you’d find at your local Super Target. But the idea is catching on, and many customers appreciate its versatility. Prime membership grants you access to a wider array of products. If you like the service, you can also subscribe to Amazon Family for $99, which gets you some extra perks, such as discounts on diapers.

Get A Discount On Games

Diehard gamers love to be the first to nab a new release. Amazon Prime members get a 20% discount on video game pre-orders and new releases. This applies to any game that has hit the market within two weeks of ordering. Just keep in mind that it only applies to physical copies of the game, and it doesn’t include console game bundles.

Get Restaurant Meals Delivered To Your Door

Just when you thought DoorDash was a wild innovation, Amazon created its own dining delivery service: Just visit Amazon Restaurants and order a multi-course meal. Granted, you have to live in a city where Amazon Prime Now already exists.

At the time they were the only band I listened to and my first year on guitar was just learning Cure stuff.  
By the late 90's I started playing in bands and grunge had kinda already worn itself out so we were really inspired by post punk and pre emo kinda stuff, mostly Sunny Day Real Estate, which made me believe a band could convey emotion and still hit hard, Jawbox / Burning Airlines, and a big one was a band called No Knife from San Diego.  They tuned up to F and wrote really interesting interacting guitar parts that just sounded different than anything else I ever heard at the time.  No traditional solos, different (hard to figure out) chords and phrasing, really good melodies and a solid rhythm section.  I think their drummer is still touring with Pinback.  Its too bad they broke up because I believed they would have found some decent success when indie bands like Pinback and Death Cab starting getting some attention, along with the internet allowing alternate ways to hear music, since they were never gonna be on anything but college stations.  If anyone is interested, check out Academy Flight Song, Mission Control, Riot for Romance, and Flechette.  I will still be trying to get people to listen to No Knife when I'm in a nursing home.  
Of course, Radiohead is probably a huge influence on anyone who started playing guitar in the 90's and they still are.  I love when a player or players make the guitar sound like a different instrument altogether and they do it better than anyone.  All while still writing amazing and interesting music from a traditional point of view that can still sound great played alone on an acoustic.  
I should also mention I wanted to be in a punk band for a while and NOFX is probably the best at fitting in the limiting 90's style three or four chord punk song genre while still writing really interesting guitar stuff.

&gt; Life began for Kamasi Washington on February 18, 1981 in Los Angeles, California. In the Washington family music was more of a prerequisite than a privilege. But Kamasi never saw it that way, his love for music began at first sound. His father, Rickey Washington is a professional saxophonist by night and a high school music teacher by day. Kamasi’s mother, Valerie Washington is an accomplished flutist who fell in love with the world of science and became a high school chemistry teacher after her stint as a genetic researcher. By the age of two Kamasi had already began to play the drums and piano, the only thing that kept him away from the wind instruments at that early age was his lack of dental development. He began his exploration into the world of the reeds and brass when he was about seven and his father gave him a clarinet. By the age of twelve Kamasi had found his voice in the form of a tenor saxophone, in fact it was the same saxophone that his father played in high school. 

&gt; Over the next year Kamasi’s development and devotion to music had out grown his academic environment. So he transferred from The Los Angeles Center of Enriched Studies (one the top academic high schools in the nation) and enrolled into the Hamilton High School Music Academy. It was around this time that Kamasi also joined The Multi School Jazz Band (M.S.J.B.), an assembly of the finest young jazz musicians in Los Angeles County and led by Reginald Andrews the same man that taught Kamasi’s father in high school. Because of the sheer vastness of talent that he was surrounded by it was in The Multi School Jazz Band that Kamasi was most inspired during his high school years. Through M.S.J.B. Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi’s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as “The Young Jazz Giants”. 
This fiery group of “Young Giants” wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year “The Young Jazz Giants” had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. 

&gt; After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson’s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album “In My Time” which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi’s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called “Bird Man Records” heard him playing with “The Young Jazz Giants” and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the “big break” for “The Young Jazz Giants” but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after its completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay “ready and waiting” for too long, thus “The Young Jazz Giants” unofficially disbanded. 

&gt; Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called “The Next Step” and that’s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking. 

&gt; (2) Kamasi Washington didn't pick up a saxophone until he was 13 years old, but by that point, he'd been playing several other instruments. That's when he found his calling. Within a couple years, he was the lead tenor saxophonist at Hamilton High School Music Academy in his native Los Angeles. After graduation, he attended UCLA to study ethnomusicology. While enrolled at UCLA, he recorded a self-titled album with Young Jazz Giants, a quartet he had formed with Cameron Graves and brothers Ronald Bruner, Jr. and Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner, released in 2004. From that point, Washington continually performed and recorded with an impressive variety of major artists across several genres, including Snoop Dogg, Raphael Saadiq, Gerald Wilson, McCoy Tyner, George Duke, and PJ Morton. In 2014 alone, Washington demonstrated tremendous range with appearances on Broken Bells' After the Disco, Harvey Mason's Chameleon, Stanley Clarke's Up, and Flying Lotus' You're Dead!, among other albums that covered indie rock, contemporary and progressive jazz, and experimental electronic music. 

&gt;  The following year, Washington contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly and finally debuted as a leader with The Epic, released on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label. An expansive triple album nearly three hours in duration, it involved the other three-quarters of Young Jazz Giants -- by then part of his larger ten piece collective, altnerately known as The Next Step and West Coast Get Down-- string orchestra and choir conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. 

&gt;  The Epic was a critical and commerial success. Not only did it land at number three on the jazz charts, it also found its way on to independent albums and heatseekers charts as well. Washington and his band were not only able to tour the U.S., but to play in Europe and Japan as well. ~ Andy Kellman

&gt; Janelle Monáe is a U.S. singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and performer.

&gt; Monáe was born Janelle Monáe Robinson on 1st December 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas. She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

&gt; Cass McCombs (born in Concord, California in 1977) is an American singer-songwriter and performer.

&gt; An enigmatic folk nomad, McCombs is a quintessentially American artist; ""he's quietly become one of (the country's) finest chroniclers of fringe characters, a writer of heart-rending love songs and psychedelic odes to the natural world, a teller of tall-tales with a sense of humor dry as desert wood, and that rare folksinger who actually sings about the folk."" His vocals range somewhere between the anxious drone of Lou Reed, the hollow croon of Elliott Smith, the lilting melody of Morrissey, and the driving earnestness and complexity of bards such as Leonard Cohen or Bob Dylan. His lyrical style is alternately vivid and weary, laconic and yearning, or drifting into the high-spirited and whimsical.

&gt; After cutting his first EP, Not the Way in San Francisco in 2001, McCombs relocated to Baltimore, MD. There he released ""Not the Way"" in 2002 and recorded his first full-length, A, in 2003 on Monitor Records. He spent the next few years touring: playing All Tomorrow's Parties; and opening for bands such as Modest Mouse, The Decemberists, and Belle and Sebastian; before recording his second LP PREfection, which was released on 4AD in 2005. 

&gt; McCombs' subsequent releases have been on the highly successful British independent label Domino Recording Co. 2007's Dropping the Writ was named one of Amazon's Best Albums of that year. Catacombs was voted one of the 50 greatest albums of 2009 by Pitchfork Media, and features Academy Award-nominated actress and singer Karen Black on the track Dreams-Come-True-Girl. During this period, McCombs toured with the likes of Arcade Fire, Andrew Bird, Band of Horses, José González, Beach House, and The Walkmen.

&gt; Catacombs also established McCombs' relationship with engineer/producer Ariel Rechtshaid, member of The Hippos and Foreign Born, who produced Grammy-winning hit Climax for Usher, the Plain White T's Grammy-nominated No.1 platinum-selling single Hey There Delilah, and albums for Vampire Weekend, Sky Ferreira, Snoop Lion, and Haim, among others.

&gt; In 2010 McCombs played Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago, L.A.'s Culture Collide Festival and Invisible Children Benefit. 2011 offered an extensive headlining tour, an appearance at SXSW, and two albums released by McCombs and produced by Rechtshaid: Wit's End in April and Humor Risk in November. The two albums were made simultaneously. In an interview with Pitchfork, McCombs explains: ""Wit's End was started years ago and it slowly made its way to the finish line. Humor Risk was just punched out. They're friends but they're different. Wit's End is like a stew; Humor Risk is the raw food diet.""

&gt; Big Wheel and Others, McCombs' seventh full-length (and first double album) was released in October 2013. The album is rooted in the Americana mythos of the Wild West, from the San Francisco drug culture to the gunslingers and gold rush of the nineteenth century. The album once again features Karen Black on a version of the track Brighter!, her final recording before passing away due to ampullary cancer in August, 2013. Big Wheel is dedicated to her memory.

&gt; Thurston Joseph Moore (born July 25, 1958) is an American musician best known as a singer, songwriter and guitarist of Sonic Youth. He has also participated in many solo and group collaborations outside of Sonic Youth, as well as running the Ecstatic Peace! record label. 
In 2012, Moore started a new band Chelsea Light Moving, with their first track, ""Burroughs"", released as a free download. Chelsea Light Moving's eponymous debut was released on 5 March 2013.

&gt; Moore was ranked 34th in Rolling Stone's 2004 edition of the ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time."" In May 2012, Spin published a staff-selected top 100 ranking Moore and his Sonic Youth bandmate Lee Ranaldo together on number 1.

&gt; Moore was born in Coral Gables, Florida and was raised in Bethel, Connecticut. Although he enrolled at Western Connecticut State University, he opted to move to New York City instead. There he learned to play guitar from Glenn Branca and soon co-founded Sonic Youth, serving as the band's guitarist and lead vocalist.

&gt; In 1985, he married Sonic Youth bassist, guitarist and vocalist Kim Gordon, with whom he has a daughter, Coco Hayley Gordon Moore. Thurston is known for playing Fender Jazzmaster guitars along with a host of other Fender models like the Mustang and Jaguar. Thurston is also very well known for being very harsh on his guitars.

&gt; In addition to his work with Sonic Youth, Moore has also released albums as a solo artist, one under the moniker David Adelmen, including 1995's ""Psychic Hearts"". He has collaborated with scores of artists, including My Cat is an Alien, DJ Spooky, Nels Cline, William Hooker, Christian Marclay, Loren Mazzacane Connors, R.E.M. and Cock E.S.P. In the mid-90's Moore formed a side band, The Dim Stars, with punk legend Richard Hell of Richard Hell and the Voidoids. In 2004, Moore performed in and produced an album for the all-star noise band To Live and Shave in L.A., the lineup of which also features Andrew W.K..

&gt; In 2004 Rolling Stone ranked him and Lee Ranaldo, of Sonic Youth, the 33rd and 34th best guitarists of all time. Their playing style is very innovative and they both use a large variety of extended techniques, like for instance their 3rd Bridge screwdriver technique.

&gt; Outside of his work as musical performer Moore runs the independent record label Ecstatic Peace and reviews new music in Arthur Magazine. In May 2005, he released the book Mix Tape: The Art of Cassette Culture.

&gt; Solo albums

&gt;     Psychic Hearts (1995, Geffen Records)
    Root (1998, Lo Recordings)
    Trees Outside the Academy (2007, Ecstatic Peace)
    Demolished Thoughts (2011, Matador Records)

This is why I've got no sympathy for people who say that immigrants are destroying our culture.

***MY*** culture has almost totally been destroyed by the places where it used to flourish being turned into flats or shitty theme bars that think putting pictures of David Bowie on the wall is a decent replacement for actually putting on shows by the next potential David Bowie.

And although it's not really my thing, I do feel some solidarity for it, the grime and urban music scene is being destroyed by restrictive licensing and policing, even as the music industry is trying to cherry pick and sanitize its performers, who'll still get their doors kicked in when they see some success.

'They' *are* taking our pubs. The arseholes.

Appeal to mainstream audiences more.  The Academy simply isn't going to have mainstream appeal if the films it keeps nominating for its biggest awards are limited release, lower budget, unrelatable indie flicks.

It used to be that the biggest films were also considered the best.  Gone With the Wind, Forrest Gump, Ben Hur, Titanic, Sound of Music, etc.  But something happened that caused the Academy to shun bigger, popular movies in favor of low budget, slow, glum dramas, biopics, and movies with heavier themes.  Those simply don't appeal to the majority of movie goers and so tuning into the Oscars isn't a priority.  I'm not saying that ""Captain America: Civil War"" should be a best picture contender, but I think the Academy should expand its criteria beyond the laughably obvious 'Oscar bait' and nominate films with more mainstream relevance, even if they don't fit the mold the 6000 voters of the Academy have in mind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,t3_5wj27g,,,,,,,,,,,1488256996.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1489201388.0,,,

&gt; One eskimO was ‘born’ in 2004 and is the brain child of Kristian Leontiou.  At the time Kristian was at the end of promoting his debut album: Some Day Soon (Polydor) which sold over 200,000 copies. His debut single (Story Of My Life) also went Top 10 in the UK singles chart.  Kris (as he is known to his friends) grew up in the north-west suburbs of London, his first experiences of music coming from his older sisters, who would regularly shake the Leontiou household whilst practicing with their respective punk bands, in their bedrooms! At only 10 years old Kris was mesmerized when sisters Anna and Alex would sneak him in to watch them perform at venues like The Mean Fiddler.  When most kids were getting used to weekend lay-ins, at 14 Kristian had already developed a self survival ‘street’ mentality and had already undertaken work in an array of ‘grown up’ situations that not many so young are exposed to. The resulting attribute is someone very much of his own mind, a humble belief in his own visions creatively. Often he was a child in an adult’s world. It’s no surprise then at only 15, Kristian was introduced to recording studios, adding guest vocals on friend’s garage &amp; dance demos, and using any down time to begin his first explorations musically. His early and lasting influences on these initial compositions were acts like Arrested Development, The Fugees, REM, Groove Armada and Finlay Quay.   Working in various and unsatisfying dead-end jobs after leaving school, Kris went to the studio whenever he had any spare time, hoping it would one day pay off…and eventually it did.  In his late teens Kristian met by chance Mike Sault of Warner Chappell (Dido/Craig David/Groove Armada) who promptly offered a publishing deal. Kris went traveling around the country working with various producers searching for ‘his sound’ Sault eventually paired Kristian with Producer/Song writer Pete Wilkinson (credits include Paolo Nutini &amp; Amy Macdonald) of Melodramatic Records. Together, and with Pete’s wife Sarah, they wrote and produced the Some Day Soon album in Wilkinson’s ‘spare bedroom’ studio’  The initial bedroom demos got a great and instant response from many labels and in late 2002 Kris signed to Polydor (home of Ian Brown and Snow Patrol) within a matter of weeks; Polydor had the album mixed/mastered and promptly started promoting his first single which entered the charts at no. 9. Growing up as a studio based singer, Kristian suddenly found himself on stage for the first time in his life (Islington Academy – 1000+ capacity) performing to what felt like a million people including the press, the music industry, friends, and family. In his own words ""it was the worst performance of my life, I was way too under prepared’ these days it’s a very different story ‘I feel free on stage today’ says Kristian in 2007 ‘I feel I’m meant to be up there, like I belong, back then I felt very nervous and extremely vulnerable’  During a long promotional tour for the Album throughout the UK and Europe Kris was finding it increasingly difficult emotionally ‘I began to feel like I was promoting an album that didn't really represent or ‘belong’ to me. It didn’t say anything about my personality, and musically I longed to sound more like me, whatever that was’  Kristian has always been a free spirit but at that time felt like his life was being micro managed with advice on what he said, wore, did and sang. He craved creative expression but was on a ‘good looking young man’ pop-music treadmill, one that many before him had found a false and a crushing experience.   On a flight back from L.A. in late 2004 Kristian had the flash of light that was the concept and creative birth of One eskimO ‘With absolutely no compromise’ he said ‘I wanted to create a sound of my own, magical, ambient, filmic, acoustic, beautiful and meaningful. I wanted to write about how I felt, life, love, losses &amp; failures, highs and lows, even heartbreaks. But also about how amazing human life is and how mind blowing our very existence is’.  ‘I also had my own visual interpretation of the music, for an animated visual to run alongside the music, telling magical stories with a childlike innocence whilst creating a sonic ‘journey’ for everyone. ‘Even if just for a moment, I want people to hear this and feel like it did before anything mattered in life, when they were truly free, when they were children’  The One eskimO sound was developed in a Battersea studio along side good friend - Craigie Dodds (credits include Sugababes) they took their time working with sounds and beats and soon came up with the song ‘Chocolate’.  ""This song just sums up that period in my life; this was the first proper song and just the right sound for One eskimO!"".  At the same time Kristian teamed up with Adam Falkner – experienced session musician/drummer and unbeknown to him soon to become a giraffe! They started rehearsing a live set, every detail was considered, including what everything would look and sound like for the audiences. With Kristian’s right hand man now on guitar - Martin Waugh (soon to be the penguin in the growing animal line-up) they were also lucky enough to now know Jamie Sefton who was a wizard on bass &amp; horns, he also joined and rather inevitably, become the monkey. The band was formed.   Meanwhile a mutual friend had introduced Kristian to Rollo Armstrong (faithless/dido and many more) Kristian asked Rollo directly and politely to get involved in the album, and a very reluctant Rollo agreed to take a listen to One eskimO demos. Upon hearing the song ‘Astronauts’ he immediately opted in and ended up co-producing the album with Kristian. The team was starting to mirror the vision.   At this time, it became clear that Kristian’s idea of an eskimO world and animated videos didn't really fit with the Polydor vision of a radio friendly ‘Kristian Leontiou’ so they respectfully and amicably parted company.   With the One eskimO demos completed, the band wanted to record the album how any self respecting musicians would, together and completely live. They recorded alongside ‘ark’ (Rollo/Marky Bates/ Grippa) with Phil Brown (credits include Bob Marley) engineering and all had a great time doing it. After a month of recording the band, Kristian went to Rollo’s personal ‘ark’ studios where together they spent a further year experimenting with sounds, textures, and adding lots of magic eskimO dust! 
In 2007 Martin was ‘lost in a snowstorm’ which in reality translates to Mika (who he also played guitar for) shooting to fame. He was promptly replaced by the exceptionally gifted guitarist Pete Rinaldi and what felt like a loss became a huge win ‘Pete makes us complete’ says Kris. Through a series of 'happy accidents"" Kristian met Nathan Erasmus who had just formed Gravy Media, quite literally an ‘independent company’ operating from people’s bedrooms and lounges. Gravy Media was formed with Erasmus’s childhood friend Phil Menni, together and from an early age they both shared an obsessive love for illustration and animation.  It was Nathan’s shared love of the eskimO sound that inspired the intricate visual voyages of family, innocence and magic that became the first One eskimO video. It sits alongside the stunning single ‘Hometime’   

&gt; You now know the eskimO…hello.

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles.

&gt; New LP, Broken Devotion, out now!

&gt; Free download of a new Mint Julep track 'Tame': https://soundcloud.com/keithkenniff/mint-julep-tame-free-download

&gt; Other projects by Keith Kenniff: Helios and Goldmund.

&gt; Formed in Boston, Massachusetts, in 2007, Mint Julep is the husband-and-wife team of Hollie and Keith Kenniff. Subsequently relocating to Portland, Oregon, the duo cut a limited release album, Songs About Snow, in 2008 – effectively a trial run for further recording in their home studio, the fruit of which is a sublime follow-up, Save Your Season, released in 2011. The duo self-released Broken Devotion on Unseen in 2015. An ambient album, A Deep and Dreamless Sleep, is slated for release in late 2016.

&gt; Hallmarked by Hollie’s seductive, dreamy vocals and a succession of memorably soaring choruses, all of it etched with Keith’s vivid, glinting keyboards, towering guitars and miscellaneous instrumental hooks, Mint Julep make lustrous modern pop music that is wistful and mellifluous yet simultaneously powerful, even epic – equal parts shoegazing romanticism and cool, Kraftwerkian polish. Their songs seem instantly familiar, like old musical friends, a ’classicism’ offset by the freshness and luminosity they exude as they usher you on a breathless ride through the sunlit uplands of electronic indie-rock.

&gt; Mint Julep was designed as a conscious departure from Keith’s previous, ambient- orientated projects. “When Hollie and I set out to do something, I wanted to find some way to incorporate her vocals into a slightly different style, rather than just write similar material to my solo work and lay her vocals over top”, he says. “I had the need to write something that had some distorted guitars, loud drums and was a little bolder than what I had previously done. We messed around with a track one night (which became ‘Stay’) and it was a fun process, so we just kept writing more songs so we could do a project together.”
Soon a working pattern emerged, with Keith composing music around Hollie’s lyrics or making tracks which Hollie would then add to. “It just developed after a lot of trial and error, and after a while the material started to plateau and began to sound like an album…”

&gt; A Pennsylvannian by birth, Keith Kenniff is an honours graduate of Boston’s esteemed Berklee College of Music, best known as the brains behind dulcet ambient/electronic practitioners Helios and the fingers on the ivories of post-classical piano minimalists Goldmund (the latter’s music once described by no less an authority than Ryuichi Sakamoto as “…so, so, so beautiful…”). A succession of albums under those aliases has made Kenniff the darling of discerning critics and his music has also been widely used in film, television and advertising, not least on the soundtrack to Harmony Korine’s 2007 comedy-drama Mister Lonely and the trailer for the 2009 Academy Award-nominated Revolutionary Road, directed by Sam Mendes.

&gt; Originally from Ohio, singer Hollie Kenniff maintains dual US/Canadian citizenship, having spent part of her life in Ontario. Aside from Mint Julep, she has collaborated on several additional musical endeavors in tandem with husband Keith, including a children’s music project, Meadows, (inspired by the couple’s young son), whose debut longplayer was recently released, and an ambient diversion under their own names.

&gt; Born in Chester, raised in Cambridge, England, Michelle now resides in Hollywood, California. She began studying piano and composing original music at the age of nine, and hasn't stopped since. She has received awards from the Royal Academy of Music for piano and violin and the Bishops Award for Voice.

&gt; After Graduation
Surprisingly, however, Michelle didn't initially intend to pursue a career in music. As an art history major and anthropology minor at West Chester University in West Chester, Pennsylvania, she found herself managing the Walt Disney-Tishman Collection of African Art after graduation[1] in a somewhat frustrating role:

&gt; It was heartbreaking in some ways for me because...I had come from the Guggenheim where if somebody sneezed in the general vicinity of a painting...a conservator was there with a little Q-tip...and I was now working for a corporation...that because it wasn't necessarily making them any money, they were a little bit more trepidations in spending money on the collection...it was frustrating mostly at times to work for them because of that reason.

&gt; 
Music As A Career
Fortunately for her fans, after about 18-months at Disney's Imagineering arm, Michelle decided that ""corporate America"" wasn't for her and made the decision to reconnect with her musical roots while working as a waitress in Southern California. Indeed, it was during one of her waitressing jobs that she just happened to play a few songs on the piano while the scheduled performers were on a break, that the audience's reaction was so overwhelmingly positive that she realized that music was something that she needed to seriously pursue.

&gt; It was the most bizarre experience...everybody sat down and was quiet...I played three songs and people were asking me where my album was...

&gt; 
Success
Her songs have garnered attention in both film and television over the past few years. One of her songs ""Stay"" has been featured on ""Alias"" for ABC, ""Wonderfalls"" for Fox and the WB's ""One Tree Hill"" as well as in several independent film projects with Group 101. Another song, ""Over You"", was featured on ""Smallville"" for the WB network and the newly recorded ""I'm There Too"" played on the premier episode of Aaron Spelling's new drama ""Summerland"". ""Summerland"" also used ""I Will Be Fine"" later in the season and ""All That I Want"" featured in the premier episode of NBC's ""Las Vegas"". A recent showcase of the Sundance film festival introduced Michelle to many independent feature film makes some of who are using her music for upcoming projects this summer.
This past year, Michelle has been working on various other music projects in Los Angeles and the UK. ""Project PI"" by Al West features Michelle singing her song ""Please"". The album will be release in Europe by the end of this year.

&gt; Michelle is an active participant in the singer/songwriter community of Southern California, and has performed at clubs as diverse as the Whiskey A Go Go, the Hotel Cafe, Ghengis Cohen, the Joint and the Temple Bar, to name a few.

&gt; She recently recorded a select few songs with producer Evan Biegel of Seasound Studios in North Hollywood and is collaborating on an electronica album, due out early next year. New acoustic recordings are an on going project and a compilation of some of them will be released over the next few months. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; This youthful band is a purveyor of a panoramic yet nuanced sound, flowing from intimate to anthemic, the mood from vibrant to contemplative, with frontman Cameron Neal’s lyrics ranging from confessional to metaphorical. The result evokes the wide-open spaces of America’s Midwest but infuses the sense of grit and wonderment with edgier emotions.
Horse Thief originally founded in Denton, TX, moved to Oklahoma City to attend the Academy of Contemporary Music at the University of Central Oklahoma, from which they recently graduated. The band subsequently signed with the Flaming Lips’ management and soon came to the attention of Bella Union. Though Fear In Bliss was conceived at Horse Thief’s Oklahoma headquarters the band decided to record the album in LA, “to leave our comfort zone of Oklahoma”, and producer Thom Monahan (Devendra Banhart, Vetiver) has helped the band fuse their renowned stage performance with studio quality.

&gt; The over-arching theme to Fear In Bliss is “finding yourself and what you believe in, and finding the comfort in acknowledging fear. I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression which comes out a lot on the new album. But when everything gets rough, I think there’s always a way to fix it. The biggest thing for me is to give comfort to people, to shed light on the truth that someone is feeling the same way as them.”
""Fear in Bliss"" available for Pre-Order at www.bellaunion.com

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. The first single from the album was called ""Mistress Mabel"" and was released on May 26, 2008. The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd.

&gt; Mission of Burma is an American post-punk band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1979. The band was formed by Roger Miller (guitar), Clint Conley (bass), Peter Prescott (drums) and Martin Swope (tape manipulator/sound engineer). Miller, Conley and Prescott share singing and songwriting duties. Like many of their post-punk contemporaries, Mission of Burma's efforts are largely concerned with extending punk's original vocabulary without losing its essential rebellious spirit. Using rapid shifts in dynamics, unconventional time signatures and chord progressions along with tape effects, Mission of Burma challenges the prevailing idioms of punk while attempting to retain its power and immediacy.

&gt; In early years the band's audience was limited to the Boston area, with all their recordings released on the small Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. The band released only one album in its original form, Vs.. Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope, and has since recorded two more albums, ONoffON and The Obliterati.

&gt; Their wall-of-noise musical sound extended the vocabulary of punk while continuing to hold clear its sense of power and abandon.  They used a number of tape effects, different chord progressions, and time shifts to highlight their formal training in music.  Not only that but they are seen now as a highly influential band to both post-punk and experimental music to come after; many bands cite Burma as an inspiration, including Nirvana, Superchunk, Creed, The Grifters, R.E.M. (who regularly covered ""Academy Fight Song"" on their Green tour), Sonic Youth, Throwing Muses, Yo La Tengo, Soul Asylum, Pixies, Sugar, Catherine Wheel, Guided by Voices, Graham Coxon and Moby - the last two of which have covered """"That's When I Reach For My Revolver.""

&gt; The band were due to tour in 1980 with Joy Division but the suicide of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's singer, canceled the tour. In 1983, after releasing their only full-length studio record Vs., the group disbanded due to Miller's worsening tinnitus.

&gt; The band found increasing relevance throughout the 90s, culminating in the publication of Michael Azzerad's essays Our Band Could Be Your Life which featured Mission of Burma. In 2002, they reunited and began playing reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and formerly Prescott's Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller relates that ""when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin's position, we told him he could use current digital technology which accomplishes Martin's antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted for maintaining the original integrity, and uses a tape deck.""

&gt; Floater began in 1993 when Robert Wynia (lead vocals, bass), Peter Cornett (drums), and Dave Amador (guitar), got together in Eugene, Oregon, making their start at garage parties and the U of O beer garden. With compelling lyrics and adept storytelling, their music shifts in mood from the insistent and heavy to the melodic and soulful, comprising the signature sound for which Floater is best known.

&gt; Floater's regional success was noticed by Elemental Records, who put out their first full-length record, ""Sink"" in 1994. That same year Floater began a string of sold out shows at the Community Center for the Performing Arts (The WOW Hall) that is still unbroken to this day.

&gt; In 1995 Floater released ""Glyph"" and toured the country for the next two years supporting the record. The single, ""Danny Boy"" received heavy college and commercial radio play, in many cities outselling major label releases. Floater received nominations to the preliminary level of the Grammy's from NARAS (National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences) in 1995 under Best Rock Performance for ""Sink"" and in 1996 under Best Alternative Performance for ""Glyph."" (Prelims are determined by nominations from the NARAS members).

&gt; In 1998, following their move to Portland, Oregon (where the band currently resides), Floater released their third full-length record, ""Angels in the Flesh and Devils in the Bone."" The second concept album by the band (""Sink"" was the first), ""Angel's"" brought a new vibe to Floater. It wasn't long before widespread audiences came to embrace what has now become the band's trademark - their versatility. 

&gt; September of 2000 brought the release of Floater's fourth full- length record, ""Burning Sosobra""; a musical collection that explores the band's broad range of song writing. Following its release, the band began to perform live acoustically. Both the band and the fans enjoyed this new avenue of performance that allowed the ""quieter"" side of Floater to emerge and be explored. Of late, the band has begun playing shows where acoustic Floater opens for electric Floater - giving a sort of Jekyll and Hyde feel to their performances.

&gt; In 2002 Floater released their most critically acclaimed record to date, ""Alter."" Combining the bands strongest musical elements, ""Alter"" moves fluidly from heavy riffs to lullabies and tells flowing stories of fear, love and above all change.

&gt; August of 2004 - The release of the band's acoustic record, ""Acoustics."" Fans of Floater's electric shows responded with enthusiasm to the band's occasional acoustic performance - with their record label's encouragement, the band put together a uniquely recorded album - one that mimics the sound of their actual performances. Recorded in a studio built in the ballroom of their producers house, the record was made without digital editing and has a fresh, live feeling. 

&gt; Floater is also the name of a late nineties indiepop band from Sheffield, UK. They briefly rename themselves Floater UK before later reforming as Dangerlust. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Glasgow’s C Duncan, born 1989, is the son of two classical musicians. Surrounded by music throughout his childhood, Christopher initially took up piano and viola. His teens led him to school bands – learning to play guitar, bass and drums – but did little to quell his fascination with the composition and performance of classical music. He eventually enrolled in Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland) to study music composition, where his pieces were performed by various ensembles across the UK.

&gt; To hear C Duncan’s music now is to grasp those two common threads between his interests in classical and modern music. The pieces that make up his forthcoming debut LP are formed from lush choral harmonies and acoustic instrumentation, textured like contemporary dreampop and all recorded at home in Glasgow on his bedroom studio setup, gradually built up one layer and one instrument at a time. The results of this methodical and isolationist recording process give us charming lo-fi folk with the harmonic width of choral composition, the sweetness of barbershop and the rough eloquence that has so readily soundtracked Glasgow over the past decades.

&gt; Christopher is also an accomplished painter, naming Grant Wood and Gerhard Richter as influences. His work has been exhibited throughout Scotland and he provides cover art for his own records, expressing the same musical ideas through painted image. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Janelle Monáe is a U.S. singer, songwriter, dancer, producer, and performer.

&gt; Monáe was born Janelle Monáe Robinson on 1st December 1985 in Kansas City, Kansas. She moved to New York to study theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy. Her original plan was to pursue a career on Broadway, but she soon changed her mind and returned to music. After moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 2003,  Monáe founded the Wondaland Arts Society with like-minded young artists, and made a couple of appearances on OutKast's 2006 album Idlewild, where she is featured on the songs ""Call the Law"" and ""In Your Dreams"".

&gt; By 2007, Monáe was ready to release her first solo work, titled Metropolis. It was originally conceived as a concept album in four parts, or suites, which were to be released through her website and mp3 download sites. After the release of the first part of the series, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase in mid-2007, these plans were altered following her signing with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' label, Bad Boy Records, later in the year. The label gave an official and physical release to the first suite in August 2008, which was retitled Metropolis: The Chase Suite (Special Edition) and included two new tracks. The EP was generally well-received by critics, gaining Monáe a 2009 Grammy nomination in the Best Urban/Alternative Performance for her single ""Many Moons"", festival appearances, and opening slots for the indie pop band Of Montreal. Monáe also toured as the opening act for band No Doubt on their summer 2009 tour.

&gt;  In a November 2009 interview, Monáe revealed the title and concept behind her album The ArchAndroid. The second and third suites of Metropolis are combined into this full-length release, in which Monáe's alter-ego, Cindi Mayweather - also the protagonist of Metropolis: The Chase Suite - becomes a messiah-like figure to the android community of Metropolis.

&gt; Vocalist and guitarist for Irish rock group The Frames. Hansard quit school at age 13 to begin busking on local Dublin streets. He first came to public attention as guitar player 'Outspan Foster' in the Alan Parker film The Commitments, a role he subsequently regretted, believing it distracted from his music career. In 2003 he presented the first series of Other Voices: Songs from a Room, which showcased Irish music talent on RTÉ. He released The Swell Season, his first solo album, on April 21st 2006, in collaboration with a Czech singer and multiinstrumentalist Markéta Irglová, Marja Tuhkanen and Bertrand Galen.

&gt; Glen recently starred in the movie 'Once' alongside Markéta Irglová which won a prestigious Sundance Audience Award in 2007, as well as the 2008 Academy Award for Best Originial Song (for ""Falling Slowly""), beating out three songs from the Disney musical ""Enchanted"" and one song from ""August Rush"" (both were heavy contenders). Its Irish release took place on 23rd March 2007 and appeared in cinemas further afield later in the year.

&gt; Glen's latest album, Rhythm and Repose, was released in June 2012. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Editors are a British indie rock/post-punk revival band from Birmingham, England, formed by Tom Smith (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Russell Leetch (bass) Ed Lay (drums) and Chris Urbanowicz (guitar)  who met while studying at Staffordshire University, in Stafford, England, United Kingdom during 2002. After Chris' departure in 2012 , Justin Lockey and Elliott Williams joined the band for their live gigs and participated in the recording of the fourth album.

&gt; The band were originally known as (The) Pride, before they changed their line-up and became known as Snowfield, becoming a popular unsigned band. They remained with this name until they signed with Kitchenware Records in September 2004. The band's debut single Bullets was released as a limited edition of 500 on Kitchenware Records on January 24, 2005; it quickly gained support from radio stations such as Xfm and BBC 6 Music - where it was the single of the week.

&gt; Their debut album, The Back Room, was released on 25 July 2005, to critical acclaim. The band toured out most of 2005, including two jaunts with We Are Scientists. However, after a pivotal support slot on Franz Ferdinand's Arena tour at the end of 2005, it was the re-release of single Munich in January 2006 that propelled them into the top 10 of the UK single's chart. The following May, Editors played three sell-out shows at London's Brixton Academy, and countless gigs worldwide. The album has now sold over 500,000 units.

&gt; In June 2007 Editors released a second album, An End has a Start which included the single Smokers Outside The Hospital Doors. This first track was released on June 18th 2007 in the UK, and June 26th in the US, however it was leaked onto the Internet earlier. The album's title track, An End Has A Start was released on September 3rd, The Racing Rats on November 26th, 2007. Following a landmark appearence on The Other Stage at the Glastonbury festival, the album entered at number 1 in the UK album chart. 

&gt; 'In this Light And On This Evening', the third studio album, was released on October 12th 2009. With the heavy synthesizer sound and industrial ring, the album differed immensely from the earlier work of the band. Tom explained this change as a way for the band to try something completely different. Papillon, the first single, was followed by You Don't Know Love. The third single was Eat Raw Meat = Blood Drool. The album was inspired by the city of London, both lyrically as musically and debuted at number 1 in the UK album charts.

&gt; On April 16th 2012, during the recording of their fourth studio album with producer Flood, Editors announced that Chris Urbanowicz (guitar) was leaving the band basing the decision entirely upon the band's future musical direction.

&gt; ‘The Weight Of Your Love’, their fourth studio LP, was released on July 2013. It was preceded by the single 'A ton of love, released in May. This is also the first album to feature new band members Justin Lockey and Elliott Williams. It was recorded at Blackbird Studio in Nashville with producer Jacquire King and mixed by Craig Silvey.

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

A more worksafe version is also available on Steam. 

If you're interested in a strategy game, consider [Eiyuu Senki - The World Conquest](https://vndb.org/v6458). The current official English localization is only for Sony PS3. There are plans to release it for PC (both worksafe and NSFW versions) during 2017.

[Dandelion - Wishes Brought to You](https://vndb.org/v10792) is one of two PC titles created by the Korean company Cheritz. It features simulation gameplay and girl x boy relationships. An official localization is available on Steam.

[Magical Diary: Horse Hall](https://vndb.org/v7499) is an indie game for computers. The protagonist attends a magic academy. There's quite a bit of simulation / RPG gameplay. It includes both girl x boy and girl x girl relationship options. I played *Magical Diary* some years ago and enjoyed it. 

The freeware title [Heartache 101](https://vndb.org/v7840) does not have much to offer in terms of graphics or music. Its story introduction is completely skippable. Play it because of its simulation gameplay. The protagonist builds stats, juggles relationships, and explores the town. Random events are generated through a board game interface.

I'm not sure how much gameplay the indie title [VA-11 HALL-A](https://vndb.org/v18872) offers. It seems to be a story with some adventure game / simulation aspects.

&gt; Despite having obvious musical chops, success has by no means been handed to Search The City on a silver platter. And much like a beautiful stone sculpture, this act’s final shape was first cut with sharp chisels and pounded with heavy hammers, before being rubbed smooth with rough sandpaper. As your high school gym teacher always said: no pain, no gain.

&gt; This Detroit, MI band recorded their first Tooth and Nail full-length, A Fire So Big the Heavens Can See It, in St. Cloud, FL with James Paul Wisner, who has also produced Dashboard Confessional, Underoath, and The Academy Is. While making this CD, the band fought off small town cabin fever, was restricted to bicycle transportation, and even shared a lake with an alligator. But such ordeals are colorful stories for another time because these guys are simply thrilled (but not to death) with the finished product.

&gt; The track “To the Moon for All I Care” is one of the group’s favorite new tunes. On the surface, one might assume it is based around what Ralph Kramden always told his wife Alice on the old The Honeymooners show. But as drummer Adam McMillion explains it, this song goes far deeper than that.

&gt; “The song is about our favorite movie, Danny Deckchair, which is about this guy that’s kind of fed up with his girlfriend who is not very faithful. And his job is really boring, so he decides to attach these balloons to his fold-up deckchair and he flies away,” McMillion says. When he finally lands, he’s in a faraway town, miles from everything and everyone he knows. “He kind of gets to start his life over, and we always thought that’s just such a cool concept,” McMillion continues. In fact, this song’s main character demands at one point, “Tell me about my future ‘cause I already know my past.”

&gt; Another noteworthy song has the intriguing title of “Detroit Is Built on Secrets”. This one takes on some of the nasty rumors oftentimes spread about rock bands – even about nice guys like Search The City. “So this is what we’re up against in this city of secrets,” states its anti-gossip lyric. But even when confronted with obvious lies, this thoughtful band still finds room for a little self-examination. “In the bridge it says, “Oh my God, forgive me for who I’m not,”” McMillion elaborates. “All these rumors are going around,” he continues, “but we’re still not the people we want to be. We’re still not the people God wants us to be. It’s just a cry out; kind of a confession. We wanna be better. We realize that we’re not who we should be.”

&gt; These closely bonded band members, which also include Alex Sheldon (guitar), Jim Czech (guitar), and Josh Frost (vocals), draw artistic inspiration from many loud and noisy sources, then translate these harsher sounds into surprisingly melodic, highly emotional songs.

&gt; “We’re more influenced by hardcore music than anything else,” Frost says of Search The City’s sound. “It doesn’t show so much because we’re pretty pop-y in parts. But collectively, we all love bands like Jimmy Eat World and bands like that.” So how would they describe their unique style? “We’d probably say progressive rock or something like that,” answers Frost.

&gt; Although the group is proud of their new CD, this band is truly in their element in concert. “Live is definitely Search The City’s favorite thing to do,” McMillion says without any hesitation. “It’s a chance to release a lot of emotion. We all love what we do onstage where we’ll just look at each other and just start laughing and smiling because it’s so much fun. Playing live is definitely the best part about being in a band.”

&gt; Search The City’s original nucleus, Sheldon, Czech, and McMillion, came up with the band’s Mapquest-like moniker while seeking out other musicians to complete their final lineup. “They named it that because they were looking for all of the different members, all over different cities,” Frost explains. “That meant all over Michigan. And because I was living in Florida at the time, they just called it Search The City.”

&gt; No doubt, Search The City succeeded in getting all their geographic coordinates correct.

&gt; After the band went their separate ways and onto some side projects, Frost and Czech have announced via Facebook and AboslutePunk.com has reported that they are back together and writing a second full-length album that's due out in the spring of 2012. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; As a young boy, London-born Neil Cowley studied classical music at the prestigious Royal Academy, and by the age of 10 had performed a Shostakovich piano concerto to a full house at London’s Queen Elizabeth Hall.

&gt; By his mid-teens, Cowley had joined a friend in a Blues Brothers tribute band, “as a way” he says “of getting into pubs”, yet the London pub circuit served him well – he learned to play classic, old school Rnb in a number of bands whose members had come from, or went on to great things. By the age of 17 he turned his back on formal training altogether, and entered the world of pop.   He went on to record and tour with some of the best soul and funk bands of the day, including The Pasadenas, 4 years with the Brand New Heavies, and Zero 7, until in 2002 he formed his own band, Fragile State.

&gt; As one half of the Fragile State production duo, Cowley set the world of jazzy chill-out music alight and produced two critically acclaimed albums, from which came Four-Four-Four, a track  that was later licensed by Vodafone for a nationwide commercial.  When the record company dissolved, Cowley continued to make music; his incredible versatility as a composer saw him producing themes to a number of television programmes and documentaries, drawing on desert blues, chill, jazz and orchestral soundtrack.

&gt; Cowley soon began to find the experience of extracting music from a computer chip unbearable, so set forth with his dear friend the piano and a renewed enthusiasm to present creativity without technological hindrance.  Cowley began composing and eventually realised a long-standing vision, and formed the Neil Cowley Trio with Richard Sadler on double bass and Evan Jenkins on drums.

&gt; In June 2006 Cowley formed his own label, Hide Inside Records, and released the trio’s debut album Displaced, an outstanding album of original recordings that established him as a dazzling pianist and stunning composer.   Through his examination of the possibilities of the acoustic piano trio, Cowley created a unique trademark sound that delivered, powerful music of massive dynamic range and contrasts – where ferociously forceful, hook laden melodies sit side by side with reflective, tender pieces capable of heart shattering tenderness.  The album was released to huge critical acclaim, and won the 2007 BBC Jazz Award for Best Album.

&gt; In February 2007, the Neil Cowley Trio undertook their first full UK tour, revealing Cowley’s instinctive flair and ingenuity as an entertainer.  At the heart of their captivating live performances is Cowley’s marvellously English wit, mischievous humour and remarkable rapport with his audience.

&gt; In the summer of 2007, the trio recorded their follow-up album, Loud… Louder…Stop for the indie jazz label, Cake.   Fizzing with the energy of rock and the surging dynamics of dance music, Cowley solidified his sound, yet stretched the envelope further.  Released in March 2008, it placed him and his trio at the forefront of the British ‘Post-Jazz’ movement, and earned them far reaching critical acclaim from across the musical spectrum.  Mojo hailed the recording as a “Modern Classic”, and listed it in their ’50 Best Albums’ of that year.  The trio became noted for blurring the boundaries between jazz and other genres, and, dubbed ‘Jazz for Radiohead fans’, they found themselves with a diverse touring schedule that would take them from Glastonbury and the iTunes Festival to the infamous Ronnie Scott’s Jazz Club.   A TV appearance on Later with Jools, a Mojo cover- mounted CD (a celebratory reworking of the Beatle’s Revolution), and a Guinness commercial inched them further toward crossover status.

&gt; In the meantime, dedication to his trio would see Cowley decline various invitations to appear as side man on other projects.  However, his contribution to the platinum-selling 19, the debut recording from Adele, and in particular his poignantly expressive intro to the stand-out  Hometown Glory is now legendary.  More recently, Cowley has collaborated with the Stereophonics on their current album, Keep Calm and Carry On.

&gt; Radio Silence is Cowley’s third album and undoubtedly his most cohesive recording to date.  It is released in April 2010 on one of the UK’s most exciting Indie labels, Naim Jazz, and though the recording does not stray too far from the Cowley template, it represents the sound of a band fully comfortable in their unique sonic skin.  It is the record that Cowley has been working towards, seizing the magical empathy of his unit, who, with thousands of hours under their belt have learnt to breathe and listen as one.

&gt; Neil is married with two gorgeous children. Read more on Last.fm.

Queen Is Dead-

-Marr/Morrissey songwriting and musicianship

-Significance of time it was released

-Incredible lyricism that encapsulates feelings of dread, remorse, longing, loneliness, death and pure disdain for life

Song recs: cemetery gates, vicar in a tutu, there is a light, bigmouth strikes again, the boy with the thorn in his side

Funeral-

-Set the blueprint for indie music to flourish the past ten years (and it has)

-A product of Win Butler's incredible lyricism and incessant songwriting (recommend you watch his red bull music academy interview), the album has so much detail yet feels so natural

-Just listen to it, the music speaks for itself to be honest

Song recs: wake up, rebellion, neighborhood #1 and 3

Edit: These are two really great examples of albums that were significant because of the period they were released in and, although they do hold up all these years later, you still have to understand how revolutionary they were when they came out.

&gt; It was in 2011 that Iceland's king of lo-fi layered lushness, Sindri Már Sigfússon released “Summer Echoes” as an album under the name of his solo-project Sin Fang (he had previously recorded as “Sin Fang Bous” and as ""Seabear""). The album oscillates wildly unearthing glimpses of familiarity - vintage Flying Nun here, Paw Tracks there and a Belle and Sebastian pop nous - while retaining the own stark originality of this uber-talented artist and producer. 

&gt; And Sigfússon is a pretty unlikely ambassador of the Icelandic indie pop scene: in his teens he was a skateboard and Hip Hop aficionado, his arms are covered with a colourful mess of self designed tattoos and besides doing visual arts his true favourite obsessions are soccer and pizza: what makes him pretty much an antidote to the all too present cliché of the Icelandic nature boy. Sigfússon didn’t pick up a guitar until he was 20 but after graduating from art academy and moving to London he became sick and bought his first proper home recording equipment from the insurance money he got. And within just a few years, his infamous work ethic (he has a very strict 9 to 5 routine working on songs in his basement studio) and distinctive do-it-yourself production style culminated in the Sin Fang (Bous) debut album “Clangour” which was released on Morr Music in 2009 to worldwide acclaim and suddenly propelled him in the midst of a new wave of bands redefining the indie rock game in thus far unexpected directions. 

&gt; Enthusiastic media and blog coverage and live shows in Europe, North America and Brazil followed. 

&gt; After having set himself the task of playing all instruments on his debut solo album ""Clangour"", this time around Sigfússon wanted to move closer to the sound of a live band and recruited a number of his friends from múm, Amiina and Seabear to record “Summer Echoes” in his own studio and Sigur Rós Sundlaugin studio. The arrangements are more band oriented, grander in scope and more transparent than their predecessor’s and there is a diverse breadth of sounds across ""Summer Echoes"" dozen songs, reaching from a heart-breaking intimate piano ballad like “Two Boys” to sudden outbursts of guitar noise in “Bruises”. Not even the one-off appearance of synthetic beats in ""Sing For A Dream"" sound out of place when drenched in Sin Fang's signature layered wash of sound and it is the album's first single, ""Because Of The Blood"" that encapsulates the essence of this album in an euphoric orchestral pop song that manages to merge epic tune sculpting with several layers of choir abundance. 

&gt; The fact that Sigfússon did not only write all the music but also was doing most of the recording and production promises a lot for his future and “Summer Echoes” conveys the feeling that the real story has only just begun: and in fact a next Sin Fang album is already fully written and Sigfússon shows no willingness to slow down. Summer Echoes will be released on Morr Music in March 2011. A limited edition Sin Fang 7"" featuring the non-album coverversions of Fleetwood Mac's ""Landslide"" and Simon &amp; Garfunkel's ""The Only Living Boy In New York"" is available as of December 2010 while the album's first single, ""Because Of The Blood/Two Boys"" will be out in February 2011. The artwork for the release was done together with Sigfússons partner Inga Birgisdóttir. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Gareth Coker is a British composer for film, games, and commercials. Since moving from Japan to Los Angeles in 2009, Gareth has developed a compositional style focusing on memorable, melodically-driven themes and motifs, combined with unique, and unconventional soundscapes. This approach, and his ability to apply it in a way that always serves to enhance the story earned him the attention of Moon Studios, which led to a highly successful collaboration on the acclaimed game Ori and the Blind Forest, released in March 2015 and reviewed as one of the highest rated games on Xbox One. 
The universally critically acclaimed soundtrack has won several prestigious awards, including an Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences award for Outstanding Music Composition, a SXSW Gaming Award for Excellence in Musical Score, and the Game Audio Network Guild’s Audio of the Year.

&gt; Since the release of Ori, he has had the opportunity to craft a soundtrack for Minecraft's Greek Mythology expansion pack. He has also contributed music to the independent games Primal Carnage, The Mean Greens, and inMomentum. This year Gareth is working on finishing the score for ARK Survival Evolved. Additionally, the realm of Virtual Reality opened up through veteran developer Insomniac Games as he was given the chance to score their new title The Unspoken, an action game that pulls players into a world of spellcasting and magicians’ duels. The game will be released during the holidays.

&gt; Coker's film work includes upcoming feature film Emma's Chance (starring Greer Grammar), upcoming documentary Resistance is Life, Labyrinth (starring James Franco), and Dark Power (starring Kristianna Loken and Sean Patrick Flanery). He has also scored a plethora of short films, including Recoil, Waking Up, and What To Bring To America.

&gt; In addition to his scoring duties, he writes numerous cues for advertisements and library music companies (EMI Production Music, ICON Trailer Music). Clients include Jaguar, Ultimate Fighting Championship, ITV, Nevada Energy and more. 

&gt; Gareth was educated at the Royal Academy of Music in London and at the University of Southern California. He has lived in Hilversum (Holland), Baltimore, Utsunomiya (Japan), and Los Angeles.

Imo nothing on The 1975 (the regular edition, not the beautiful deluxe edition) touches a lot of ILIWYS songs. And that's not a negative thing, it's just commentary on how much better they've gotten.

Also you're missing the point. Yes Frank purposely missed the deadline but my point is if the Grammys really cared about honoring the best in music they would've nominated it regardless. They made a right decision nominating Chano and Anderson .Paak for BNA, but they still have tons of progress to make. For one thing, they should stop nominating stuff like Sturgill for AOTY when he has absolutely no chance and was only nominated because the Academy wants to appeal to indie music fans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,t3_5gtldk,,,,,,,,,,,1481156229.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1483558708.0,,,
t5_2szp0,,,,1481183849,,,,,,,TrueFilm,,,,,,dawkyfs,,,0,,,,GinsbergsPeacock,,,t3_5gvr1o,30,,,,,,"      Romance really isn't recognized much by film buffs, because of how easily it can fall into the mundane or idealistic. That said, generally speaking, I've identified four broad categories. At it's core, a ""romance"" is characteristically a story that focuses on a specific romantic relationship; I've therefore omitted any films that have romantic elements but do not actually put such a relationship at the forefront of the plot.

1) **Traditional Romance**. Plays all of the tropes straight, mostly a drama (or occasionally adventure) setup where the primary conflict is generated and resolved around getting a couple together. Sometimes barely distinguishable from a romantic tragedy, and can even include metamodernist interpretations verging on romcoms. Examples include:

* *Gone With the Wind* (1939, Fleming, Cukor, Wood)
* *An Affair to Remember* (1957, McCarey)
* *Romancing the Stone* (1984, Zemeckis)
* *The Princess Bride* (1987, Reiner)
* *Dirty Dancing* (1987)
* *Shakespeare in Love*, (1998, Madden)
* *The Notebook* (2004, Cassavetes)
* *Pride and Prejudice* (best version is 2005, Wright)

1A) **Musical Romance**. Same thing, generally, but with music. Mostly killed by *Hello Dolly* in 1969.

* *Singin' in the Rain* (1952, Kelly, Donan)
* *Gentlemen Prefer Blondes* (1953, Hawks)
* *The King and I* (1956, Lang)
* *Gigi* (1958, Minelli)
* *West Side Story* (1961, Laurents)
* *The Music Man* (1962, DaCosta)
* *My Fair Lady*, (1964, Cukor)
* *The Sound of Music* (1965, Wise)
* *Camelot* (1967, Logan)
* *Grease* (1987, Kleiser)
* *The Phantom of the Opera* (2004, Schumacher)
* *Rent* (2005, Columbus)

1B) **Disney Romance**. Often musical and animated, but of an especially naive and fairytale quality. Juvenile, but with a strong impact on cinema and American culture. Currently experiencing a live-action remake revival. Notable examples:

* *Cinderella* (1950)
* *Sleeping Beauty* (1959)
* *The Little Mermaid* (1989)
* *Beauty and the Beast* (1991)
(*Aladdin*, *Pocahontas*, *Hercules*, *Tarzan*, and *The Princess and the Frog* all have strong romantic subthemes)
* *Tangled* (2010)

2) **Romantic Tragedy**. Very similar to a traditional romantic drama, except most of the emotional pull is from unresolved conflict, namely the couple not getting together or being extremely unhappy together. Examples include:

* *Casablanca* (1943, Curtis)
* *Ghost* (1990, Zucker)
* *Edward Scissorhands* (1990, Burton)
* *Romeo + Juliet* (1996, Luhrmann)
* *Titanic* (1997, Cameron)
* *In the Mood for Love* (2000, Kar-Wai)
* *Moulin Rouge* (2001, Luhrmann)
* *Atonement* (2007, Wright)
* *Anna Karenina* (2012, Wright)
* *By the Sea* (2015, Jolie) (hilariously prescient)

2A) **LGBT Drama**. The newest addition to the genre, wherein the primary source of conflict is between societal convention and nonconforming orientation/gender. Like romcoms, there's a lot of low budget trash, and since the topic is so sexually charged there can be a lot of gratuitous softcore porn involved. Still, some art manages to rise to the surface, although they have all been decidedly more depressing than satisfying:

* *Brokeback Mountain* (2005, Lee)
* *Blue is the Warmest Color* (2013, Kechiche)
* *Carol* (2015, Haynes)
* *The Danish Girl* (2015, Hooper)

3) **Romantic Comedy**. By far the most common and cheapest romantic genre. Films that have roughly the same narrative as a traditional romance, but generally avoid any emotional depth. YMMV on how subversive a film has to be to jump out of this category into romantic deconstruction. The deepest they've probably gotten include:

* *Some Like it Hot* (1959, Wilder)
* *Pretty Woman* (1990, Marshall)
* *Love Actually* (2003, Curtis)
* *Down with Love* (2003, Reed)
* *Silver Linings Playbook* (2012, Russell)
Meg Ryan's entire career

4) **Romantic Deconstruction**. A romance film that can be a drama, a tragedy, or a comedy, but thematically prefers to expose the holes in traditional romance narratives more than it likes to reinforce them. The least emotionally gratifying of the romance genres, unless you find more satisfaction in truth than in hope. Examples:

* *Annie Hall* (1977, Allen)
* *Moonstruck* (1987, Jewison)
* *Amelie*, (2001, Jeunet)
* *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* (2004, Gondry)
* *Shortbus* (2006, Mitchell)
* *Enchanted* (2007, Lima)
* *(500) Days of Summer* (2009, Webb)
* *About Time* (2013, Curtis)
*  *Before Trilogy* (1995, 2004, 2013, Linklater)

4A) **Manic Pixie Dream Girl/Boy**. These indie sort of romances try to be deconstructionist and subvert the standard romcom formula, but end up portraying the romantic interest as more of a concept than a fleshed out being. Huge overlap with child romance below. Examples (I'm too lazy to look up years/directors).

* *Breakfast at Tiffany's* (1961, Edwards)
* *Mean Girls*
* *Garden State*
* *Elizabethtown*
* *Love and Other Drugs*
* *Scott Pilgrim vs. the World*
* *Pitch Perfect*
* *The Fault in Our Stars*

4B) **Romance Horror**. Pretty much the opposite of the MPDG, where the romantic interest is villainized rather than idealized. Generally not recognized as romance films, but arguably are deconstructions of the genre in their own right, often preying on fears of stalking, rape, infidelity, or domestic abuse.

* *Rosemary's Baby*
* *Candyman*
* *Misery*
* *Audition*
* *Antichrist*
* *Obsessed*
* *May*

4C) **Adolescent Romance**.  There is a burgeoning teen romance genre that is attempting to portray young love as more complicated than in earlier high school genre films. To a large part this depth is affected, but the phenomenon can't be ignored. I'm not listing these at all because the approach is fundamentally naive, but examples of recent teen romance series include *Twilight*, *The Hunger Games*, *Divergent*, *50 Shades of Grey*, and even to an extent *Harry Potter* and clones like *Percy Jackson*. These represent another reversal of the standard MPDG trope, where instead the *main character* is an empty slate Mary Sue/Gary Stu, allowing for self-insert vicarious wish-fulfillment. Earlier iterations were likely high school romcoms like *Mean Girls*, *Easy A*, *10 Things I Hate About You*, *She's All That*. Somewhat related are Wes Anderson's recent films, which tend to romanticize prepubescent love as something pure, genuine, and on a level with adult love.

Of these, I'd say essential examples include:

* *Casablanca*, *Gone with the Wind*, *Some Like it Hot*, *Singin' in the Rain* - genre definers for romantic tragedy, romance epic, romantic comedy, and romantic musical, respectively.
* *Breakfast at Tiffany's* - the advent of the manic pixie dream girl.
* *Cleopatra* - the biggest budget accounting for inflation and the biggest flop of all time. A long, extravagant period epic that mostly amounted to a vapid and turgid affair between Cleopatra and Marc Antony; thus it is a romance epic in the vein of *Gone With the Wind*.
* *Annie Hall* - the all-important first deconstruction of the manic pixie dream girl.
* *The Princess Bride* - objectively unremarkable, but somehow has become the quintessential fantasy romance.
* Meg Ryan and Julia Roberts. Love for the modern woman.
* *Beauty and the Beast* - perhaps Disney's most exclusively and expressly romantic animated feature, also the first to be nominated for best picture.
* *Titanic* - how teenage heartthrob power can influence award prestige.
* *Shakespeare in Love* - the biggest WTF light-romcom sweep in academy history.
* *Brokeback Mountain* - the breakthrough film that brought homosexuality to the forefront of popular discussion. Widely considered snubbed when *Crash* took the best picture Oscar.
* *La La Land* - I haven't seen it yet, but the fact that it's best picture front-runner probably means something.

Other more pointed topics could include:

* *Elizabethtown*/*Garden State* vs. *(500) Days of Summer*/*Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* - the MPDG renaissance and the resulting backlash that created some of the best romantic deconstructions to date.
* Bazh Lurhmann and the rise of the pop-hits pastiche romance, later followed by things like *Happy Feet*, *Burlesque*, *The Great Gatsby*, *Rock of Ages*, *Across the Universe*, *Mamma Mia!* and other ridiculous trash.
* Joe Wright's love of lavish period romdrams, particularly the way *Pride and Prejudice* and *Anna Karinena* reflect on each other.
* The recent upsurge in teenage romance fiction
* Wes Anderson's fascination with and promotion of ""mature"" young love.
* Particular films that established certain actors/actresses as recurring romcom veterans. These include *The Wedding Singer* (Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore), *There's Something About Mary* (Cameron Diaz), *The Notebook* (Rachel McAdams, Ryan Gosling), *Knocked Up* (Seth Rogan, Catherine Heigl), *Silver Linings Playbook* (Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper). Given the target demographic has traditionally been females, you're going to see a lot more women like Anne Hathaway, Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann, Amy Schumer, Judy Greer, Mila Kunis, and Jennifer Lopez establish themselves in this medium than men (John Duhamel? Zac Efron? Taylor Lautner? I dunno). Male actors are usually hunk-of-the-week eye candy, because part of the romcom fantasy is the ability to reduce men to sex objects, and have the illusion of choosing freely between them. Much in the way action films continue to cycle through female eye candy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,t3_5gvr1o,,,,,,,,,"simple, miserable, solid all the way through",,1481132313.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1483548849.0,,,

&gt; After couple of solo performances as a singer/songwriter, Dukat Stray a.k.a. Stray Dogg decided to form a band in the winter of 2011 with Ana Janković and Jelena Damjanović who are the graduates of the Music Academy of Belgrade.

&gt; The band performed as a opening act to Chinawoman and Scout Niblett after only a couple of months ofpractice, with only a 4 song Demo available. The band needed another guitar player, and that's when Marko, former member of the Belgrade electropop band Inje, joined Stray Dogg to play solo guitar. 

&gt; In 2011 they released their debut album ""Almost"" available for free download at their Bandcamp page.  The album was recorded in a studio called ""Baukova Soba"".

&gt; In 2012, two new members (Uroš Milkić, Vladimir Milićević) joined the band during their concert tour. In October they released their second album titled ""Fire's Never Wrong"" following the July single release of the same title. Album brings 9 new songs, one of them, titled Time, features Devendra Banhart. This album is also available for free download at their Bandcamp page.

I've been watching SF/SFN for about a month now. I'm late to the game, but at least I showed up. 

I used to watch some of Bree's videos years back. We're the same age, so I guess we shared the same awkward phase at the same time, or whatever. When I saw a thumbnail with her in it, I figured I'd check it out, and guess what - I liked it woooow!

I'm a 26 year old that acts like a 19 year old. A somewhat battle-worn 19 year old that needs to go to the bathroom a lot.

I studied film at the Los Angeles New York Film Academy, so naturally I'm unemployed and looking for stuff to do. One of the good things that came out of it was that my taste in movies and music have changed. It's easier to enjoy performances and technical aspects in movies now than it was before. There's a lot of great indie-films being made at the moment, but sadly they aren't widely distributed. Some of the recent ones I loved are ""The VVitch"", ""Certain Women"", ""A Most Violent Year"", and ""Excision"".

Not really a foodie. Don't like chocolate, ice-cream, pie, hotdogs ... Nachos are good, though!

The last thing I saw on Netflix was either ""The Crown"" or ""Adaptation"". Both were great! Haven't seen Black Mirror yet, have to get around to it.

&gt; Glasgow’s C Duncan, born 1989, is the son of two classical musicians. Surrounded by music throughout his childhood, Christopher initially took up piano and viola. His teens led him to school bands – learning to play guitar, bass and drums – but did little to quell his fascination with the composition and performance of classical music. He eventually enrolled in Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland) to study music composition, where his pieces were performed by various ensembles across the UK.

&gt; To hear C Duncan’s music now is to grasp those two common threads between his interests in classical and modern music. The pieces that make up his forthcoming debut LP are formed from lush choral harmonies and acoustic instrumentation, textured like contemporary dreampop and all recorded at home in Glasgow on his bedroom studio setup, gradually built up one layer and one instrument at a time. The results of this methodical and isolationist recording process give us charming lo-fi folk with the harmonic width of choral composition, the sweetness of barbershop and the rough eloquence that has so readily soundtracked Glasgow over the past decades.

&gt; Christopher is also an accomplished painter, naming Grant Wood and Gerhard Richter as influences. His work has been exhibited throughout Scotland and he provides cover art for his own records, expressing the same musical ideas through painted image. Read more on Last.fm.

1. Triple Crown Records
2. Academy Fight Song
3. Music On Vinyl 


 
 
Academy fight song pressings of this one should just flat out be avoided. They have a high collector value for some reason but they are the worst of the bunch in pretty much every aspect from sound quality to presentation. The band had no involvement, it was basically an indie label licenseing it and creating their own assets. Bad art, bad printing quality, mastering straight off a CD. They are limited and come in many colors but that's about all there is that can be positively said about them. 
 
 
The AFS was released more or less concurrently with the Triple Crown pressing, they were kind of racing to hit the market before the other. The Triple Crown is the one that has the correct presentation with official artwork and better printing, etc. its what the artists involved actually had a hand in creating. The album shown in my post is the /500 red vinyl variant from the first pressing run but Triple Crown has licensed the album for continued pressing runs over the years. A black vinyl version is still available. As you can see in the video, the colored variants from the first pressing were not made to the greatest standards, I haven't seen one that was completely flat. But they are sufficient. 
 

 
Sony has the rights to distribute the album in Europe, and so the MoV was licensed from Sony for distribution in Europe. It has the quality you can expect from a European release - the quality of the jacket and the printing is not nearly as good. It's actually not even a gatefold, just a slightly wider thin card jacket with both LPs stuffed in, an a sticker directly applied to the jacket since they don't shrinkwrap their records. It uses some official art assets that were created for the Triple Crown release and it may be less expensive for you if you live in Europe. If you live in the states it will probably be more expensive as it will be an import. It's also still available new, so be careful and know what you're buying from who you're buying it from. 

 
I would definitely get the MoV over the AFS, but I would choose any of the Triple Crown pressings above all. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,t3_5e4wrs,,,,,,,,,Crosley,,1479748638.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1481644418.0,,,

&gt; Despite having obvious musical chops, success has by no means been handed to Search The City on a silver platter. And much like a beautiful stone sculpture, this act’s final shape was first cut with sharp chisels and pounded with heavy hammers, before being rubbed smooth with rough sandpaper. As your high school gym teacher always said: no pain, no gain.

&gt; This Detroit, MI band recorded their first Tooth and Nail full-length, A Fire So Big the Heavens Can See It, in St. Cloud, FL with James Paul Wisner, who has also produced Dashboard Confessional, Underoath, and The Academy Is. While making this CD, the band fought off small town cabin fever, was restricted to bicycle transportation, and even shared a lake with an alligator. But such ordeals are colorful stories for another time because these guys are simply thrilled (but not to death) with the finished product.

&gt; The track “To the Moon for All I Care” is one of the group’s favorite new tunes. On the surface, one might assume it is based around what Ralph Kramden always told his wife Alice on the old The Honeymooners show. But as drummer Adam McMillion explains it, this song goes far deeper than that.

&gt; “The song is about our favorite movie, Danny Deckchair, which is about this guy that’s kind of fed up with his girlfriend who is not very faithful. And his job is really boring, so he decides to attach these balloons to his fold-up deckchair and he flies away,” McMillion says. When he finally lands, he’s in a faraway town, miles from everything and everyone he knows. “He kind of gets to start his life over, and we always thought that’s just such a cool concept,” McMillion continues. In fact, this song’s main character demands at one point, “Tell me about my future ‘cause I already know my past.”

&gt; Another noteworthy song has the intriguing title of “Detroit Is Built on Secrets”. This one takes on some of the nasty rumors oftentimes spread about rock bands – even about nice guys like Search The City. “So this is what we’re up against in this city of secrets,” states its anti-gossip lyric. But even when confronted with obvious lies, this thoughtful band still finds room for a little self-examination. “In the bridge it says, “Oh my God, forgive me for who I’m not,”” McMillion elaborates. “All these rumors are going around,” he continues, “but we’re still not the people we want to be. We’re still not the people God wants us to be. It’s just a cry out; kind of a confession. We wanna be better. We realize that we’re not who we should be.”

&gt; These closely bonded band members, which also include Alex Sheldon (guitar), Jim Czech (guitar), and Josh Frost (vocals), draw artistic inspiration from many loud and noisy sources, then translate these harsher sounds into surprisingly melodic, highly emotional songs.

&gt; “We’re more influenced by hardcore music than anything else,” Frost says of Search The City’s sound. “It doesn’t show so much because we’re pretty pop-y in parts. But collectively, we all love bands like Jimmy Eat World and bands like that.” So how would they describe their unique style? “We’d probably say progressive rock or something like that,” answers Frost.

&gt; Although the group is proud of their new CD, this band is truly in their element in concert. “Live is definitely Search The City’s favorite thing to do,” McMillion says without any hesitation. “It’s a chance to release a lot of emotion. We all love what we do onstage where we’ll just look at each other and just start laughing and smiling because it’s so much fun. Playing live is definitely the best part about being in a band.”

&gt; Search The City’s original nucleus, Sheldon, Czech, and McMillion, came up with the band’s Mapquest-like moniker while seeking out other musicians to complete their final lineup. “They named it that because they were looking for all of the different members, all over different cities,” Frost explains. “That meant all over Michigan. And because I was living in Florida at the time, they just called it Search The City.”

&gt; No doubt, Search The City succeeded in getting all their geographic coordinates correct.

&gt; After the band went their separate ways and onto some side projects, Frost and Czech have announced via Facebook and AboslutePunk.com has reported that they are back together and writing a second full-length album that's due out in the spring of 2012. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Floater began in 1993 when Robert Wynia (lead vocals, bass), Peter Cornett (drums), and Dave Amador (guitar), got together in Eugene, Oregon, making their start at garage parties and the U of O beer garden. With compelling lyrics and adept storytelling, their music shifts in mood from the insistent and heavy to the melodic and soulful, comprising the signature sound for which Floater is best known.

&gt; Floater's regional success was noticed by Elemental Records, who put out their first full-length record, ""Sink"" in 1994. That same year Floater began a string of sold out shows at the Community Center for the Performing Arts (The WOW Hall) that is still unbroken to this day.

&gt; In 1995 Floater released ""Glyph"" and toured the country for the next two years supporting the record. The single, ""Danny Boy"" received heavy college and commercial radio play, in many cities outselling major label releases. Floater received nominations to the preliminary level of the Grammy's from NARAS (National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences) in 1995 under Best Rock Performance for ""Sink"" and in 1996 under Best Alternative Performance for ""Glyph."" (Prelims are determined by nominations from the NARAS members).

&gt; In 1998, following their move to Portland, Oregon (where the band currently resides), Floater released their third full-length record, ""Angels in the Flesh and Devils in the Bone."" The second concept album by the band (""Sink"" was the first), ""Angel's"" brought a new vibe to Floater. It wasn't long before widespread audiences came to embrace what has now become the band's trademark - their versatility. 

&gt; September of 2000 brought the release of Floater's fourth full- length record, ""Burning Sosobra""; a musical collection that explores the band's broad range of song writing. Following its release, the band began to perform live acoustically. Both the band and the fans enjoyed this new avenue of performance that allowed the ""quieter"" side of Floater to emerge and be explored. Of late, the band has begun playing shows where acoustic Floater opens for electric Floater - giving a sort of Jekyll and Hyde feel to their performances.

&gt; In 2002 Floater released their most critically acclaimed record to date, ""Alter."" Combining the bands strongest musical elements, ""Alter"" moves fluidly from heavy riffs to lullabies and tells flowing stories of fear, love and above all change.

&gt; August of 2004 - The release of the band's acoustic record, ""Acoustics."" Fans of Floater's electric shows responded with enthusiasm to the band's occasional acoustic performance - with their record label's encouragement, the band put together a uniquely recorded album - one that mimics the sound of their actual performances. Recorded in a studio built in the ballroom of their producers house, the record was made without digital editing and has a fresh, live feeling. 

&gt; Floater is also the name of a late nineties indiepop band from Sheffield, UK. They briefly rename themselves Floater UK before later reforming as Dangerlust. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD ""Edgy In Brixton"" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London. The DVD contains a full live performance of the debut album Costello Music, B-Sides from various singles and a new song called Pretty Like a Girl. Extras on the DVD include the band being asked questions by members of The Fratellis' website, and on the deluxe edition, highlights from the T In The Park 2007 festival. It was released in the United States on the 30 October 2007

&gt; 2007-2008: Here We Stand

&gt; On November 20, 2007, it was announced on the Fratellis' official website that work had begun on the second album in rehearsal space in Glasgow. The band stated that they are self-producing the album and have their own studio to record in. Recording finished on January 13, 2008.

&gt; On February 22, 2008, they played a small show for fans at Queen Margaret Union to debut new songs from the upcoming album. About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. The first single from the album was called ""Mistress Mabel"" and was released on May 26, 2008. The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd. The Fratellis released a deluxe edition of Here We Stand internationally on December the 8th. The CD includes a new song titled 'Moriarty's Last Stand' and the accompanying DVD includes ""The Year Of The Thief"" (A documentary of the band on the road in the US); A live show filmed on June 18th 2008 at the Fillmore, San Francisco; performances of Milk and Money, Flathead and Mistress Mabel from Abbey Road Studios and the videos for the singles Mistress Mabel and Look Out Sunshine!
On April, 22 2010, both singer Jon Lawler and bassist Barry Wallace posted messages on their forum saying the band are unlikely to record together again soon.

&gt; The Fratellis have announced during June 2012 that they have decided to reform to help raise money for The Eilidh Brown Memorial Fund on the 15th of June at the MacRobert Centre in Stirling. The band plans on announcing more dates for later in the year.
The band then announced an extensive UK tour during December 2012 to take place in April 2013. During the UK tour, 3 more songs were debuted live; ""She's Not Gone Yet (But She's Leaving), Seven Days and Whiskey Saga.
On February 4th 2013, The Fratellis announced they had finished recording their third album, which was revealed to be called We Need Medicine with a release date of October 7th 2013. ""Seven Nights Seven Days"" was released as a single on September 29th. The album was recorded in Glasgow with Jon Fratelli and Stuart McCredie on production duties.

&gt; On the 24th of April 2013 it was announced that The Fratellis would be headlining Brownstock Festival in Essex on Sunday the 1st of September.

&gt; On the 22nd June 2013 The Fratellis headlined New College Commemoration Ball, a white-tie Ball set in the grounds of New College, Oxford.
On 13th October 2013 their new album We Need Medicine debuted at at number 26. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; The first thing you realise when listening to Fossil Collective is that this is a band that do things differently. Beautiful melodic music, with rich glorious harmonies and meticulous attention to detail, it is as much an aural statement as it is a pleasure to listen to. Layer upon layer of harmony mixed with delicate uplifting sounds may well remind you of other artists, be it Neil Young, Simon &amp; Garfunkel or Midlake but this music is no mere imitation. Whilst Fossil Collective's songs tip their cap to these classic musicians, scratch the surface and you discover something more contemporary, yet equally as rewarding.

&gt; It seems impossible that something so sonically complete could appear as if from nowhere, but Fossil Collective, the Yorkshire two-piece have been perfecting their craft and working towards this moment for years. Consisting of multi-instrumentalists David Fendick and Jonny Hooker, both were local musicians from the Leeds music scene, whose paths had crossed at various points in different bands. 'What separated Jonny from the other people I'd met was his total commitment to music' begins Dave. 'Whereas other people we were around were in bands for somewhat clichéd reasons, our focus was the music and the songs and for that reason we gravitated towards each other'. After a successful album with Leeds band Vib Gyor, the duo decided to strip everything back and start again.

&gt; Jonny reminisces, ""we felt we had to fold our cards and be honest to ourselves. We were listening to the kind of music we grew up with. (Neil Young, Fleetwood Mac, The Beach Boys, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, James Taylor) We decided there and then to try and capture the essence of that traditional songcraft, to strip everything back to the song, lyrics and melody'' Dave steps in ""It was actually very liberating to be able to do that"".

&gt; Armed with 3 roughly prepared demos, the duo found themselves looking for a recording studio. 'We had no money at all, but our friends had a modest little studio in a crypt just outside of the city' says Dave. 'It was a totally surreal place to go to as it was in the middle of nowhere. We had to stop recording at various points during the day as the main church was directly above the crypt. Whenever there was a mass or a wedding for example we had to be quiet - like little church mice scurrying about downstairs.’ However, a week of intense recording paid off, and they re-surfaced with 3 songs that would become their self released 'Honey Slides' EP. 

&gt; Jonny explains. 'Before we had even decided on the name Fossil Collective we realised that we wanted this project to be a continual running order of like-minded local artists. We worked on the principle that if we surrounded ourselves with an evolving stream of people we admired then our music would never become stale. Keeping away from the constraints of a 'typical' band dynamic would keep it open and interesting for us. If we wanted a harpist we'd go and find one, If we wanted a cellist we'd go and find one and so on.'

&gt; Knowing they were on to something special they wanted something visual to reflect this. Enlisting the help of Leeds animator Ashley Dean (Broken Pixel) was the next logical step. ‘Ash is a good friend and a like-minded independent local artist. We played him On &amp; On and asked him to interpret the song.’ The result was the stop/start animated video of a courtship between a wolf and a stag that went viral on youtube, getting over 250,000 hits in 2 weeks. 

&gt; Once they put their heads above water, things started happening very quickly. Their 3rd gig was at Shepherds Bush Empire, supporting Benjamin Francis Leftwich. ""It was great because other artists were contacting us, saying how much they liked our music and inviting us to tour"" remembers Jonny. ""It was sudden, but we were lucky to have great network of friends to come play with us and help interpret the songs live … after all, who is going to turn down the chance to play Shepherds bush Empire!"" The band did a full tour with Ben and then another UK support with soul singer Ren Harvieu.

&gt; On 11th June 2012 Fossil Collectives Debut EP 'Let It Go' was released. Lead track was 'Single of the Week' on iTunes USA, opening the doors to a lot of new fans. It received plays and support from Mark Riley, Radcliffe and Maconie, Chris Hawkins and Steve Lamacq at 6 Music. It also won the 6 music rebel playlist. Radio 2 support came from Bob Harris, Mark Radcliffe and an extremely supportive Dermot O'Leary who invited them in for a chat and to perform on his Saturday Radio2 show.  'Let it Go' also made the XFM playlist, the Q playlist &amp; the NME 'A' list. A 10 date headline tour coincided with this, selling out in Manchester &amp; London in a matter of days.

&gt; The band built on this success by releasing the 'On &amp; On' EP on 22nd October. Receiving the same support from radio, they were also invited in to record an infamous Daytrotter Session. Press support came from Sunday Times, Time Out, The Fly, The Independent &amp; NME. It was at this point that The Civil Wars starting tweeting about how much they were enjoying the music. A few friendly emails later and Fossil Collective were supporting them at the key gigs of their UK tour. (Camden Roundhouse, Manchester Apollo, Glasgow 02 Academy) 'We feel privileged to play anywhere though' says Dave - be it our last sell out London show to a couple of hundred people, or a few thousand people at Camden Roundhouse. What is important is that we always stay true to ourselves and the music.'

&gt; After a winter spent locked away in the studio, Fossil Collective came out of hibernation with “Tell Where I Lie” in hand – their beautifully crafted, ten track, debut album. The album hit record stores on April 8th 2013, the same day the band were invited into Bob Harris’ Radio 2 studio to record a two track session. Released to rapturous acclaim from both fans and critics alike; “Tell Where I Lie” was named iTunes’ ‘editors choice’, quickly climbed to number 1 in the US ‘New Artist Billboard Chart and graced the pages of Clash, Q Magazine, NME, Drowned In Sound and Hunger. 

&gt; With  extensive UK and US tours scheduled for the rest of the year, it’s looking to be a very productive 2013 for the band. ""We look back to just over a year ago"" says Dave ""When it was just the two of us sitting in Jonny's house with a couple of acoustic guitars working on those first ideas - it's incredible how much we have achieved in such a short amount of time""

&gt; At least one thing is certain - in another 12 months, many, many more people will have fallen for the intense song writing of Fossil Collective. Music like this cannot be kept a secret for long.

&gt; Cass McCombs (born in Concord, California in 1977) is an American singer-songwriter and performer.

&gt; An enigmatic folk nomad, McCombs is a quintessentially American artist; ""he's quietly become one of (the country's) finest chroniclers of fringe characters, a writer of heart-rending love songs and psychedelic odes to the natural world, a teller of tall-tales with a sense of humor dry as desert wood, and that rare folksinger who actually sings about the folk."" His vocals range somewhere between the anxious drone of Lou Reed, the hollow croon of Elliott Smith, the lilting melody of Morrissey, and the driving earnestness and complexity of bards such as Leonard Cohen or Bob Dylan. His lyrical style is alternately vivid and weary, laconic and yearning, or drifting into the high-spirited and whimsical.

&gt; After cutting his first EP, Not the Way in San Francisco in 2001, McCombs relocated to Baltimore, MD. There he released ""Not the Way"" in 2002 and recorded his first full-length, A, in 2003 on Monitor Records. He spent the next few years touring: playing All Tomorrow's Parties; and opening for bands such as Modest Mouse, The Decemberists, and Belle and Sebastian; before recording his second LP PREfection, which was released on 4AD in 2005. 

&gt; McCombs' subsequent releases have been on the highly successful British independent label Domino Recording Co. 2007's Dropping the Writ was named one of Amazon's Best Albums of that year. Catacombs was voted one of the 50 greatest albums of 2009 by Pitchfork Media, and features Academy Award-nominated actress and singer Karen Black on the track Dreams-Come-True-Girl. During this period, McCombs toured with the likes of Arcade Fire, Andrew Bird, Band of Horses, José González, Beach House, and The Walkmen.

&gt; Catacombs also established McCombs' relationship with engineer/producer Ariel Rechtshaid, member of The Hippos and Foreign Born, who produced Grammy-winning hit Climax for Usher, the Plain White T's Grammy-nominated No.1 platinum-selling single Hey There Delilah, and albums for Vampire Weekend, Sky Ferreira, Snoop Lion, and Haim, among others.

&gt; In 2010 McCombs played Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago, L.A.'s Culture Collide Festival and Invisible Children Benefit. 2011 offered an extensive headlining tour, an appearance at SXSW, and two albums released by McCombs and produced by Rechtshaid: Wit's End in April and Humor Risk in November. The two albums were made simultaneously. In an interview with Pitchfork, McCombs explains: ""Wit's End was started years ago and it slowly made its way to the finish line. Humor Risk was just punched out. They're friends but they're different. Wit's End is like a stew; Humor Risk is the raw food diet.""

&gt; Big Wheel and Others, McCombs' seventh full-length (and first double album) was released in October 2013. The album is rooted in the Americana mythos of the Wild West, from the San Francisco drug culture to the gunslingers and gold rush of the nineteenth century. The album once again features Karen Black on a version of the track Brighter!, her final recording before passing away due to ampullary cancer in August, 2013. Big Wheel is dedicated to her memory.

&gt; Editors are a British indie rock/post-punk revival band from Birmingham, England, formed by Tom Smith (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Russell Leetch (bass) Ed Lay (drums) and Chris Urbanowicz (guitar)  who met while studying at Staffordshire University, in Stafford, England, United Kingdom during 2002. After Chris' departure in 2012 , Justin Lockey and Elliott Williams joined the band for their live gigs and participated in the recording of the fourth album.

&gt; The band were originally known as (The) Pride, before they changed their line-up and became known as Snowfield, becoming a popular unsigned band. They remained with this name until they signed with Kitchenware Records in September 2004. The band's debut single Bullets was released as a limited edition of 500 on Kitchenware Records on January 24, 2005; it quickly gained support from radio stations such as Xfm and BBC 6 Music - where it was the single of the week.

&gt; Their debut album, The Back Room, was released on 25 July 2005, to critical acclaim. The band toured out most of 2005, including two jaunts with We Are Scientists. However, after a pivotal support slot on Franz Ferdinand's Arena tour at the end of 2005, it was the re-release of single Munich in January 2006 that propelled them into the top 10 of the UK single's chart. The following May, Editors played three sell-out shows at London's Brixton Academy, and countless gigs worldwide. The album has now sold over 500,000 units.

&gt; In June 2007 Editors released a second album, An End has a Start which included the single Smokers Outside The Hospital Doors. This first track was released on June 18th 2007 in the UK, and June 26th in the US, however it was leaked onto the Internet earlier. The album's title track, An End Has A Start was released on September 3rd, The Racing Rats on November 26th, 2007. Following a landmark appearence on The Other Stage at the Glastonbury festival, the album entered at number 1 in the UK album chart. 

&gt; 'In this Light And On This Evening', the third studio album, was released on October 12th 2009. With the heavy synthesizer sound and industrial ring, the album differed immensely from the earlier work of the band. Tom explained this change as a way for the band to try something completely different. Papillon, the first single, was followed by You Don't Know Love. The third single was Eat Raw Meat = Blood Drool. The album was inspired by the city of London, both lyrically as musically and debuted at number 1 in the UK album charts.

&gt; On April 16th 2012, during the recording of their fourth studio album with producer Flood, Editors announced that Chris Urbanowicz (guitar) was leaving the band basing the decision entirely upon the band's future musical direction.

&gt; ‘The Weight Of Your Love’, their fourth studio LP, was released on July 2013. It was preceded by the single 'A ton of love, released in May. This is also the first album to feature new band members Justin Lockey and Elliott Williams. It was recorded at Blackbird Studio in Nashville with producer Jacquire King and mixed by Craig Silvey.

&gt; Angela Maria ""Ani"" DiFranco was born on September 23rd, 1970 from parents with Italian and Canadian backgrounds. Both her father, Dante, and her mother, Elisabeth, were architects. She grew up in Buffalo, N.Y. and played her first gigs at the age of nine, playing in local bars in her hometown. She attended the Buffalo Academy for Visual and Performing Arts. She moved to New York City at 16 and in 1988 she made a demo which has become a highly sought-after fan item. She is now a prolific artist.

&gt; Ani’s lyrics focus, amongst other topics, on war, GLBT issues, sexual assault, the music industry and, recently, the joy of motherhood. 
Early on, DiFranco saw how some talents were ignored while others were hyped up. Based on experiences in meeting with the industry she decided to stay independent and as a result she formed her own label: Righteous Babe Records(RBR among her followers). The label was formed in 1989, and a year later her self-titled debut hit the streets. From day one her popularity grew on a mouth to mouth basis. In 1991 her next relase ""Not So Soft"" came out, followed by yearly releases thereafter, with the exception of 2000, when she released only an EP called ""Swing Set"". This EP Includes a cover of Bob Dylan's ""Hurricane"".  
 
Ani tours both with a band and as a solo artist. Her touring pace has often been extreme and in 2005-2006 she had to take a break from touring due to tendonitis. DiFranco's father died early in the summer of 2005; however, she continued her summer tour as a tribute to him. Ani received a Woman of Courage award at the 2006 NOW conference where she also announced that she was pregnant. On January 20th 2007, her daughter Petah Lucia DiFranco Napolitano was born. Ani Difranco gave birth in her home in Buffalo.

&gt; DiFranco has been toasted by the Buffalo News as the ""Buffalo's leading lady of rock music."" The News further said: ""Through the Righteous Babe Foundation, DiFranco has backed various grassroots cultural and political organizations, supporting causes ranging from abortion rights to gay visibility.""

&gt; Since 2003, Ani has been nominated four consecutive times for ""Best Recording package"" at the Grammy awards, one of which she won, in 2003 for ""Evolve.""

&gt; DiFranco's guitar playing is often characterized by a signature staccato style, rapid fingerpicking and use of a plethora of alternate tunings. She delivers many of her lines in a speaking style notable for its rhythmic variation. Her lyrics, which often include alliteration, metaphor, word play and a more or less gentle irony, have also received praise for their sophistication. The song ""Talkin' Mrs. DiFranco Blues,"" by Dan Bern, strings together some of the most memorable lines from DiFranco's early career for comic effects.

&gt; Although DiFranco's music has been classified as both folk rock and alternative rock, she has reached across genres since her earliest albums. DiFranco has collaborated with a wide range of artists including pop musician Prince, folk musician Utah Phillips, funk and soul jazz musician Maceo Parker and rapper Corey Parker. She has used a variety of instruments and styles: brass instrumentation was prevalent in 1998's Little Plastic Castle, strings on the 1997 live album Living in Clip and 2004's Knuckle Down, and electronics and synths in 1999's To the Teeth and DiFranco's latest studio recording, Reprieve.

&gt; DiFranco herself noted that ""folk music is not an acoustic guitar--that's not where the heart of it is. I use the word 'folk' in reference to punk music and rap music. It's an attitude, it's an awareness of one's heritage, and it's a community. It's subcorporate music that gives voice to different communities and their struggle against authority.""

&gt; The combination of personal and political is partially responsible for DiFranco's early popularity among politically active college students, some of whom set up fan pages on the web to document DiFranco's career as early as 1994. Because DiFranco's rapid rise in popularity in the mid-1990s was fueled mostly by personal contact through her many live shows and as said above the word was spread from a fan to their friends and so on rather than mainstream press, fans often expressed a feeling of community with each other.

&gt; DiFranco has expressed political views outside of her music. During the 2000 U.S. presidential election, she encouraged voting for Ralph Nader in non-battleground states. She supported Dennis Kucinich in the 2004 Democratic primaries.

&gt; DiFranco has occasionally joined with Prince in discussing publicly the problems associated with major record companies. DiFranco is openly proud of her label, which employs a number of people in her hometown of Buffalo. In a 1997 open letter to Ms. magazine she expressed displeasure that what she considers a way to ensure her own artistic freedom was seen by others solely in terms of its financial success. Her label has set a standard for other young female singer/song writers.This has not just made her an icon for independent music, but it has also helped establish her as a true feminist which also see the importance of feminism among men. In her poem Reprieve she states that ""feminism ain´t about equality, it´s about reprieve"". 

&gt; DiFranco performed with Cyndi Lauper on ""Sisters of Avalon"", a track from Lauper's 2005 collection The Body Acoustic. She also performed with fellow folk singer Dar Williams on ""Comfortably Numb"", a Pink Floyd cover song from Williams' 2005 album, My Better Self.

&gt; Her most recent work Canon is a career retrospective that gives the listener access to all of her albums through a careful handpicked selection which includes recorded versions of classics such as ""Shameless"", ""Both Hands"" and ""Overlap"" were 3 of the new recorded song versons on Canon. Difranco re-recorded the songs together with Allison Miller on drums and Todd Sickafose on bass.

&gt; Together with Canon, she relased a poetry book with her own painting called ""Verses.""

&gt; Her latest album is called ""Red Letter Year,"" released in late 2008. Just prior to its release, Difranco said the following about the CD: ""I’m really excited. I have a new band I’m working with, and they’re all over it. Actually, there are a lot of people. I have more guests and friends and other artists involved this time around than I have in a long time. It’s fuckin’ sprawling, this record. I’ve been working on it for a while now, taking a little bit more time because I’m on baby time now. My pace is a little bit slower, which I think is great in terms of making records. I think it will benefit the end result"" 

&gt; A new album entitled ""Which Side Are You On?"" was released on January 17, 2012.

&gt; Mission of Burma is an American post-punk band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1979. The band was formed by Roger Miller (guitar), Clint Conley (bass), Peter Prescott (drums) and Martin Swope (tape manipulator/sound engineer). Miller, Conley and Prescott share singing and songwriting duties. Like many of their post-punk contemporaries, Mission of Burma's efforts are largely concerned with extending punk's original vocabulary without losing its essential rebellious spirit. Using rapid shifts in dynamics, unconventional time signatures and chord progressions along with tape effects, Mission of Burma challenges the prevailing idioms of punk while attempting to retain its power and immediacy.

&gt; In early years the band's audience was limited to the Boston area, with all their recordings released on the small Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. The band released only one album in its original form, Vs.. Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope, and has since recorded two more albums, ONoffON and The Obliterati.

&gt; Their wall-of-noise musical sound extended the vocabulary of punk while continuing to hold clear its sense of power and abandon.  They used a number of tape effects, different chord progressions, and time shifts to highlight their formal training in music.  Not only that but they are seen now as a highly influential band to both post-punk and experimental music to come after; many bands cite Burma as an inspiration, including Nirvana, Superchunk, Creed, The Grifters, R.E.M. (who regularly covered ""Academy Fight Song"" on their Green tour), Sonic Youth, Throwing Muses, Yo La Tengo, Soul Asylum, Pixies, Sugar, Catherine Wheel, Guided by Voices, Graham Coxon and Moby - the last two of which have covered """"That's When I Reach For My Revolver.""

&gt; The band were due to tour in 1980 with Joy Division but the suicide of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's singer, canceled the tour. In 1983, after releasing their only full-length studio record Vs., the group disbanded due to Miller's worsening tinnitus.

&gt; The band found increasing relevance throughout the 90s, culminating in the publication of Michael Azzerad's essays Our Band Could Be Your Life which featured Mission of Burma. In 2002, they reunited and began playing reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and formerly Prescott's Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller relates that ""when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin's position, we told him he could use current digital technology which accomplishes Martin's antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted for maintaining the original integrity, and uses a tape deck.""

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; When singer-songwriter Bird York—also an actor and screenwriter—composed the 2006 Academy Award-nominated song “In The Deep” for the Oscar-nominated film Crash, she had no visuals to go on, only a draft of the script by writer-director Paul Haggis. York originally met Haggis in 2000 when she appeared in and conceived music for his critically acclaimed series Family Law, and their fluid collaboration grew out of the fast pace demanded by a weekly hour-long series. Featuring Bird’s soulful vocals, “In The Deep”—which also appears on York’s major label debut Wicked Little High--wraps an ethereal and haunting aural blanket around Crash’s onscreen narrative in a pivotal final sequence, when the crushed and ravaged characters each reflect, in solitude, on what has happened.   
  Quiet, mesmerizing and anything but comforting, the song lingers in memory. 

&gt; Nic Harcourt, respected music guru at NPR flagship KCRW-FM/Los Angeles, has called Bird, “a songwriter of extraordinary depth with a voice to match.” Billboard’s Chris Morris has written--citing her “melodic grace” and affecting honesty”--that, “Bird York's songs subtly reveal those things that rise out of the corners of the night: Memory, reverie, desire, and the emotions that lie cloaked when the sun is high.” York began writing songs in her teens, after both her parents died, and her resonant compositions reflect hard-won life experience and a survivor’s mettle. “I’m fifteen, homeless, and some older ex-hippie guy gives me a beat-up guitar,” she says. “When most girls are worried about what to wear, I am wondering about where I am going to sleep. But I have this guitar and decided I was going to write myself a song to ride out of the freak show called TOO MUCH TOO SOON”
  “In The Deep” is just one in a sensual and intoxicatingly hypnotic collection of songs on York’s Narada/EMI major label album debut, Wicked Little High. Elegantly delivered and emotionally stirring, the disc subliminally slips, slowly but inevitably, deep into your consciousness with a sound that Music Biz Magazine called “torch trip hop.” The album opens with the richly textured and subtly psychedelic “Had A Dream,” produced by GRAMMY®-winning engineer/mixer Thom Russo (Macy Gray, Audioslave). The song swirls around the thoughts, “where logic ends, faith begins,” and, “wondering if we just try and risk everything for love/how can we ever go wrong.”  
Other stand-outs include the title track, an ironic meditation on the downside of a physical attraction that counters logic and wisdom but persists nevertheless—“Desire is such a wicked little high when the one you want is blind to you.” York’s insightful lyrics and seductive, smoky vocals make the notion of “the fifth drink before a long drive home” palpable. Wicked Little High also includes collaborations with GRAMMY®-winning producer Larry Klein (Joni Mitchell, Madeline Peyroux), and songs from the album have already aired on the network television shows House, CSI:NY, Everwood, Jake 2.0 and In Justice, as well as in the John Cusack-produced film Never Get Outta The Boat and the New line feature Peaceful Warrior. Songs from her critically acclaimed debut cd have been featured on Nip/Tuck as well as other film and tv projects.
  Possessed by a “driving desire to make things,” Bird York’s artistry is manifested across multiple disciplines. Her extensive acting credits include an ongoing role on NBC’s The West Wing, appearing in over sixteen episodes of the EMMY and Golden Globe winning show as Andy Wyatt. York has also appeared on Curb Your Enthusiasm as well as played the starring role in the NBC bio pic mini series LOVE CAN BUILD A BRIDGE portraying Naomi Judd from 25-45. On the big screen, she’s performed in features with Dennis Hopper, Diane Keaton, Julianna Margulies and Tom Waits, currently completing filming on SUBLIME opposite Tom Cavanaugh for Warner Bros?Raw Feed and is about to begin filming on the indie FOOTSTEPS this July. 

&gt; On the writing side, beyond composing, York has just compeleted a screenplay for John Wells /Warner Bros. Television, and a music-based series that she developed has been sold to Sony. 
  With everything she’s accomplished, York notes that over the years, she’s often taken the road less traveled and turned down opportunities that didn’t allow her to follow her heart or that reigned in her creativity. “I live for that tingly moment,” she says. “Even if something doesn’t work out, I could die knowing that I listened to my heart. My life really is about passion, my passion for humanity and I don’t think you should have to compartmentalize passion--I want to sing about it, write about it, and embody it in acting roles. I’m a storyteller, and my intention is to tell stories that elevate the human condition.” 
“I am interested in how music can change the molecules in a room,” she says, “and how music can make you want to slip out of your clothes and kiss someone. "" Right now, that passion is transcendent through Bird York’s music via the Academy Award-nominated song “In The Deep” and her new album Wicked Little High.

&gt; The first thing you realise when listening to Fossil Collective is that this is a band that do things differently. Beautiful melodic music, with rich glorious harmonies and meticulous attention to detail, it is as much an aural statement as it is a pleasure to listen to. Layer upon layer of harmony mixed with delicate uplifting sounds may well remind you of other artists, be it Neil Young, Simon &amp; Garfunkel or Midlake but this music is no mere imitation. Whilst Fossil Collective's songs tip their cap to these classic musicians, scratch the surface and you discover something more contemporary, yet equally as rewarding.

&gt; It seems impossible that something so sonically complete could appear as if from nowhere, but Fossil Collective, the Yorkshire two-piece have been perfecting their craft and working towards this moment for years. Consisting of multi-instrumentalists David Fendick and Jonny Hooker, both were local musicians from the Leeds music scene, whose paths had crossed at various points in different bands. 'What separated Jonny from the other people I'd met was his total commitment to music' begins Dave. 'Whereas other people we were around were in bands for somewhat clichéd reasons, our focus was the music and the songs and for that reason we gravitated towards each other'. After a successful album with Leeds band Vib Gyor, the duo decided to strip everything back and start again.

&gt; Jonny reminisces, ""we felt we had to fold our cards and be honest to ourselves. We were listening to the kind of music we grew up with. (Neil Young, Fleetwood Mac, The Beach Boys, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, James Taylor) We decided there and then to try and capture the essence of that traditional songcraft, to strip everything back to the song, lyrics and melody'' Dave steps in ""It was actually very liberating to be able to do that"".

&gt; Armed with 3 roughly prepared demos, the duo found themselves looking for a recording studio. 'We had no money at all, but our friends had a modest little studio in a crypt just outside of the city' says Dave. 'It was a totally surreal place to go to as it was in the middle of nowhere. We had to stop recording at various points during the day as the main church was directly above the crypt. Whenever there was a mass or a wedding for example we had to be quiet - like little church mice scurrying about downstairs.’ However, a week of intense recording paid off, and they re-surfaced with 3 songs that would become their self released 'Honey Slides' EP. 

&gt; Jonny explains. 'Before we had even decided on the name Fossil Collective we realised that we wanted this project to be a continual running order of like-minded local artists. We worked on the principle that if we surrounded ourselves with an evolving stream of people we admired then our music would never become stale. Keeping away from the constraints of a 'typical' band dynamic would keep it open and interesting for us. If we wanted a harpist we'd go and find one, If we wanted a cellist we'd go and find one and so on.'

&gt; Knowing they were on to something special they wanted something visual to reflect this. Enlisting the help of Leeds animator Ashley Dean (Broken Pixel) was the next logical step. ‘Ash is a good friend and a like-minded independent local artist. We played him On &amp; On and asked him to interpret the song.’ The result was the stop/start animated video of a courtship between a wolf and a stag that went viral on youtube, getting over 250,000 hits in 2 weeks. 

&gt; Once they put their heads above water, things started happening very quickly. Their 3rd gig was at Shepherds Bush Empire, supporting Benjamin Francis Leftwich. ""It was great because other artists were contacting us, saying how much they liked our music and inviting us to tour"" remembers Jonny. ""It was sudden, but we were lucky to have great network of friends to come play with us and help interpret the songs live … after all, who is going to turn down the chance to play Shepherds bush Empire!"" The band did a full tour with Ben and then another UK support with soul singer Ren Harvieu.

&gt; On 11th June 2012 Fossil Collectives Debut EP 'Let It Go' was released. Lead track was 'Single of the Week' on iTunes USA, opening the doors to a lot of new fans. It received plays and support from Mark Riley, Radcliffe and Maconie, Chris Hawkins and Steve Lamacq at 6 Music. It also won the 6 music rebel playlist. Radio 2 support came from Bob Harris, Mark Radcliffe and an extremely supportive Dermot O'Leary who invited them in for a chat and to perform on his Saturday Radio2 show.  'Let it Go' also made the XFM playlist, the Q playlist &amp; the NME 'A' list. A 10 date headline tour coincided with this, selling out in Manchester &amp; London in a matter of days.

&gt; The band built on this success by releasing the 'On &amp; On' EP on 22nd October. Receiving the same support from radio, they were also invited in to record an infamous Daytrotter Session. Press support came from Sunday Times, Time Out, The Fly, The Independent &amp; NME. It was at this point that The Civil Wars starting tweeting about how much they were enjoying the music. A few friendly emails later and Fossil Collective were supporting them at the key gigs of their UK tour. (Camden Roundhouse, Manchester Apollo, Glasgow 02 Academy) 'We feel privileged to play anywhere though' says Dave - be it our last sell out London show to a couple of hundred people, or a few thousand people at Camden Roundhouse. What is important is that we always stay true to ourselves and the music.'

&gt; After a winter spent locked away in the studio, Fossil Collective came out of hibernation with “Tell Where I Lie” in hand – their beautifully crafted, ten track, debut album. The album hit record stores on April 8th 2013, the same day the band were invited into Bob Harris’ Radio 2 studio to record a two track session. Released to rapturous acclaim from both fans and critics alike; “Tell Where I Lie” was named iTunes’ ‘editors choice’, quickly climbed to number 1 in the US ‘New Artist Billboard Chart and graced the pages of Clash, Q Magazine, NME, Drowned In Sound and Hunger. 

&gt; With  extensive UK and US tours scheduled for the rest of the year, it’s looking to be a very productive 2013 for the band. ""We look back to just over a year ago"" says Dave ""When it was just the two of us sitting in Jonny's house with a couple of acoustic guitars working on those first ideas - it's incredible how much we have achieved in such a short amount of time""

&gt; At least one thing is certain - in another 12 months, many, many more people will have fallen for the intense song writing of Fossil Collective. Music like this cannot be kept a secret for long.

&gt; Stray Dogg is a folk / americana band from Belgrade, Serbia with 6 members, Dukat Stray (Vocals, Backup Vocals, Guitar, Harp), Jelena Damjanović (Piano), Ana Janković (Backup vocals, Violin), Marko Ignjatović (Solo Guitar), Relja Ilić (Drums) and Vladimir Milićević (Bass guitar).

&gt; After couple of solo performances as a singer/songwriter, Dukat Stray a.k.a. Stray Dogg decided to form a band in the winter of 2011 with Ana Janković and Jelena Damjanović who are the graduates of the Music Academy of Belgrade.

&gt; The band performed as a opening act to Chinawoman and Scout Niblett after only a couple of months ofpractice, with only a 4 song Demo available. The band needed another guitar player, and that's when Marko, former member of the Belgrade electropop band Inje, joined Stray Dogg to play solo guitar. 

&gt; In 2011 they released their debut album ""Almost"" available for free download at their Bandcamp page.  The album was recorded in a studio called ""Baukova Soba"".

&gt; In 2012, two new members (Uroš Milkić, Vladimir Milićević) joined the band during their concert tour. In October they released their second album titled ""Fire's Never Wrong"" following the July single release of the same title. Album brings 9 new songs, one of them, titled Time, features Devendra Banhart. This album is also available for free download at their Bandcamp page.

One of the best records of year- seriously. The arrangements on this record are incredible, calling to mind Sufjans dense network of textures. On top of the amazing, idiosyncratic pop songs are Shauf's tongue in cheek lyrics. This a sad, sad record that makes me smile all the way through.

**Chris Forsyth &amp; The Solar Motel Band - The Rarity of Experience** 

esus Christ! I had only heard Chris Forsyth's solo record ""Solar Motel"" but I came across this double-LP at the Academy Records Annex in Greenpoint for under 20 bucks, so I couldn't pass it up. What would happen if Tom Verlaine played a live set with the Grateful Dead? Spin it and find out. Epic psychedelic rock with tinges of proto-punk and americana. I honestly haven't heard anything like this.

**Jaye Bartelle - Loyalty** 

Last Sunday, Captured Tracks (and their sub-label Sinderlyn) put on a matinee show at Babys All Right of intimate, acoustic acts. While everyone was a pleasure to watch, Jaye was downright captivating. His 2016 album, Light Enough, is one of the 5 best records of the year, and I don't see it getting knocked out of place in the finals months of '16, and his 2011 debut (reissued in 2015) Loyalty, is also chalk full of gems. Jaye's deep baritone voice calls to mind Stephen Merrit &amp; Calvin Johnson, as do his quirky lyrics, while his beautiful finger plucked nylon strings flow gently underneath.

**EZTV - High In Place**

Another Captured Tracks band that performed (an acoustic set) at the matinee gig last weekend. To be honest, the gig was the first time I had actively listened to the band, I'd heard the name around town and they've been recommended to me a few times but somehow I never gave them the time of day. Shame on me! These dudes rock ala The Feelies &amp; R.E.M. but manage to sound of the times and of their own voice all the while. I picked up both of their records but this one is definitely my favorite- featuring Jenny Lewis &amp; members of Real Estate and Quilt. I snagged the special edition, pressed on solid electric blue vinyl and it came with an iron on patch!

**Soft Fangs - The Light**

Earlier this week, Boston indie label Disposable America put on a showcase of some of it's bands in a small, psuedo-hidden space on Brooklyn's water front. The label, which is run by a friend and primarily puts out tapes, specializes in bedroom pop, shoegazer and generally, and genuinely, intimate pop musics.  The show was a blast, but the highlight of the whole affair was Soft Fangs- the bedroom pop passion project of John Lutkevich.

**Freddie Gibbs - Shadow of a Doubt**

Most well known for his work with Madlib on their collaborative LP Piñata, Gibbs is a force of his own. One of the hardest, tightest rap albums of the year. The production is on point and a nice change of pace from the usual beats that fill up west coast gangster rap, and Gibbs always flows with the best of them.

**Huerco S. - For Those Of You Who Have Never (And Also Those Who Have)**

Recently, Pitchfork put out a pretty heavily criticized list of the best ambient albums of all time. On that list, they included Huerco S.' sophomore LP ""For Those Of You Who Have Never (And Also Those Who Have)"". While there were a lot of headscratchers on that list, I was happy to see Huerco get his dues. The Brooklyn-via-Kansas producer took his bombed out, minimal techno a step further into the dark, producing a haunting ambient record, littered with the ghosts of dance musics past.

**Low - Things We Lost In The Fire**

Low is one of my absolute favorite bands. What other bands have managed to produce challenging music and stay relevant for over two decades? Once mentioned in the same breath as other slowcore acts of the 90's such as Red House Painters and Codeine, their sound has grown to be fuller, more lush, with the country and folk influences becoming more and more apparent working with Jeff Tweedy and recording with Justin Vernon. Their 2016 record ""Ones and Sixes"" is a must listen. ""Things We Lost In The Fire"" is a record almost smack dab in the middle of their career, when their sparse and debilitatingly slow sound was refined and brimming with emotion.

**Nicolas Jaar - Sirens**

This record has been a bit divisive, at least with the folks I've talked to. The first thing that took a lot of people by surprise is how much of an experimental vocal record it is. This record hits on classic Chilean folk music and..Doo-Wop?? Less of the left frield ala James Blake fractured dubstep/techno seen on Jaar's 12"" Nymphs series and more of a continuation of his work on Space Is Only Noise. A club record for outside of the club.

Also, this album has the best packaging of the year. The entire face of the LP jacket is covered in lottery paper, and comes in a PVC sleeve with a USA quarter. Underneath the scratch paper? A photo of Nico's father's, Alejandro Jaar, 1987 Times Square installation ""A Logo For America"". I might have to get another copy to preserve the scratch paper as it's already starting to wear from taking the record out of the sleeve to play!

**Cass McCombs - Mangy Love**

A colleague of mine put this album on at our space a few weeks ago and I was blown away. I had never listened to Cass before, though the name has been around in my circles. Whatever preconceived idea I had about his sound was- it wasn't this. Shades of Modest Mouse, Mac Demarco, and something special and impossible to categorize. This album is sad, funky and brilliant.

**Black Marble - It's Immaterial**

I haven't listened to this one yet, to be honest. Their Debut ""A Different Arrangement"" is a brilliant synth laden, post-punk record. It sounds new, not regurgitated but also fitting right alongside New Order. Brilliant hooks and utterly danceable. I pre-ordered this LP as a gift for my partner, limited pressing on white vinyl, and we've been waiting to play it until we can listen together!

&gt; Glasgow’s C Duncan, born 1989, is the son of two classical musicians. Surrounded by music throughout his childhood, Christopher initially took up piano and viola. His teens led him to school bands – learning to play guitar, bass and drums – but did little to quell his fascination with the composition and performance of classical music. He eventually enrolled in Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland) to study music composition, where his pieces were performed by various ensembles across the UK.

&gt; To hear C Duncan’s music now is to grasp those two common threads between his interests in classical and modern music. The pieces that make up his forthcoming debut LP are formed from lush choral harmonies and acoustic instrumentation, textured like contemporary dreampop and all recorded at home in Glasgow on his bedroom studio setup, gradually built up one layer and one instrument at a time. The results of this methodical and isolationist recording process give us charming lo-fi folk with the harmonic width of choral composition, the sweetness of barbershop and the rough eloquence that has so readily soundtracked Glasgow over the past decades.

&gt; Christopher is also an accomplished painter, naming Grant Wood and Gerhard Richter as influences. His work has been exhibited throughout Scotland and he provides cover art for his own records, expressing the same musical ideas through painted image. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film ""The Goonies"" (although, by coincidence, Barry's mother's maiden name is in fact Fratelli). The band consisted of lead vocalist and guitarist Jon Fratelli (real name John Lawler), bass guitarist Barry Fratelli (real name Barry Wallace), and drummer, backing vocalist, occasional guitarist and banjo player Mince Fratelli (real name Gordon McRory). They toured with a pianist / rhythm guitarist, Will Foster. The band has released three albums, 2006's ""Costello Music"",2008's ""Here We Stand"" and 2013's ""We Need Medicine"".

&gt; History

&gt; 2005-2006: Beginnings and The Fratellis EP

&gt; They played their first show on March 4, 2005 in the O'Henry's bar in Glasgow across the road from the famous Horseshoe bar, and received their first radio play in 2005 on central Scotland's Beat 106 (later XFM Scotland, now Galaxy Scotland) Beatscene show hosted by Jim Gellatly. They were signed by Fallout Records.

&gt; The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"", ""Stacie Anne"" and ""The Gutterati?"". The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them ""the best new band in Britain"". ""Creepin' Up The Backstairs"" was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was ""Henrietta"", which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts.

&gt; 2006-2007: Costello Music

&gt; Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006. It charted at number two in the UK album charts for three weeks. The success of the album led to The Fratellis winning the BRIT award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 2007, an award that was voted for by BBC Radio One listeners.

&gt; The Fratellis supported Kasabian in December 2006 on their UK tour before playing 10 dates by themselves in February and March 2007. The locations included Nottingham, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and London. Following the release of the album, The Fratellis embarked on a tour of the UK festival circuit, playing at Glastonbury and headlining at festivals such as NME's Rock 'n' Riot tour, OXEGEN 2007 and T in the Park 2007, amongst others. They also opened for The Police Reunion Tour in the summer of 2007 in some of the North America dates. The Fratellis also recorded some cover songs during the year including ""All Along the Watchtower"" for Radio 1's 40th Anniversary Double Album, Radio 1: Established 1967, and ""Solid Gold Easy Action"" for the soundtrack of the film ""Hot Fuzz"", which also included the single ""Baby Fratelli""

&gt; On 1 October 2007, they released their first live DVD ""Edgy In Brixton"" in the UK, which was recorded at the Brixton Academy in London. The DVD contains a full live performance of the debut album Costello Music, B-Sides from various singles and a new song called Pretty Like a Girl. Extras on the DVD include the band being asked questions by members of The Fratellis' website, and on the deluxe edition, highlights from the T In The Park 2007 festival. It was released in the United States on the 30 October 2007

&gt; 2007-2008: Here We Stand

&gt; On November 20, 2007, it was announced on the Fratellis' official website that work had begun on the second album in rehearsal space in Glasgow. The band stated that they are self-producing the album and have their own studio to record in. Recording finished on January 13, 2008.

&gt; On February 22, 2008, they played a small show for fans at Queen Margaret Union to debut new songs from the upcoming album. About eight new songs from their new album were played, including ""Mistress Mabel"", ""Acid Jazz Singer"", and ""Look Out Sunshine!"". This performance introduced two new touring members, a guitarist called Robin and a keyboard player, Will Foster. However, after the Teenage Cancer Trust show in 2008, Robin departed the tour for unknown reasons. Will Foster now plays both Keyboard and Guitar during live performances.

&gt; The album, called Here We Stand, was released on June 9, 2008 in the UK and June 10, 2008 in the US. The band marked the US release of the album with sold-out shows in New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. The first single from the album was called ""Mistress Mabel"" and was released on May 26, 2008. The next single was Look Out Sunshine!, released on 18th of August 2008 and with money going towards the Teenage Cancer Trust. The third single was A Heady Tale, released on December 22nd. The Fratellis released a deluxe edition of Here We Stand internationally on December the 8th. The CD includes a new song titled 'Moriarty's Last Stand' and the accompanying DVD includes ""The Year Of The Thief"" (A documentary of the band on the road in the US); A live show filmed on June 18th 2008 at the Fillmore, San Francisco; performances of Milk and Money, Flathead and Mistress Mabel from Abbey Road Studios and the videos for the singles Mistress Mabel and Look Out Sunshine!
On April, 22 2010, both singer Jon Lawler and bassist Barry Wallace posted messages on their forum saying the band are unlikely to record together again soon.

&gt; The Fratellis have announced during June 2012 that they have decided to reform to help raise money for The Eilidh Brown Memorial Fund on the 15th of June at the MacRobert Centre in Stirling. The band plans on announcing more dates for later in the year.
The band then announced an extensive UK tour during December 2012 to take place in April 2013. During the UK tour, 3 more songs were debuted live; ""She's Not Gone Yet (But She's Leaving), Seven Days and Whiskey Saga.
On February 4th 2013, The Fratellis announced they had finished recording their third album, which was revealed to be called We Need Medicine with a release date of October 7th 2013. ""Seven Nights Seven Days"" was released as a single on September 29th. The album was recorded in Glasgow with Jon Fratelli and Stuart McCredie on production duties.

&gt; On the 24th of April 2013 it was announced that The Fratellis would be headlining Brownstock Festival in Essex on Sunday the 1st of September.

&gt; On the 22nd June 2013 The Fratellis headlined New College Commemoration Ball, a white-tie Ball set in the grounds of New College, Oxford.

&gt; Songwriter Oren Lavie (Tel Aviv, Israel), who has drawn comparisons in the press to Nick Drake, the Beatles and Crosby Stills &amp; Nash, released his debut album “The Opposite Side Of The Sea” on March 10th, 2009 on his own imprint, A Quarter Past Wonderful, which he started with tastemaker and current KCRW host Chris Douridas.  Says Douridas, a 27-year veteran of radio, “I've never been so motivated to help an artist get his music out into the world until I met Oren. He is incredibly special. It's rare every song in an artist's catalogue moves me like Oren’s do.""

&gt; The album is as eclectic as Oren’s home bases of Tel Aviv, Israel (where he was born), Berlin Germany (where he recorded the album), and Los Angeles, CA (the home of his new label). It was released in Europe and immediately garnered great press with Uncut raving in a four-star review that the album is “cinematic and mellow, like Nick Drake in a cheerful summer bonnet…”

&gt; Many people in the US will be familiar with Oren’s music as his album track ‘Her Morning Elegance’ was featured in a national ad campaign for Chevy Malibu. He also wrote the end credit “A Dance ‘Round the Memory Tree” for the film The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian joining Regina Spektor and Hanne Hukkelberg on the soundtrack.

&gt; Born in Tel-Aviv, Israel, Oren began his creative journey as a playwright. At the age of 21 he wrote and directed a play for the Israeli Fringe Theater Festival, which won the awards for best newcomer writer and director. He later moved to London on a scholarship to attend the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts. While still at school he wrote a play he later directed in an Off West-end theater to critical acclaim. The production was named by Time-Out London as one of the best 5 shows in London during its run. Oren moved to NY where he gradually began to shift his focus from playwriting to a shorter form of storytelling, the song. Two years later he relocated to Berlin and began work on The Opposite Side of The Sea.

&gt; In 2007 the album was released in Europe, then found its way to the KCRW playlist in LA. Shortly after that the album track ‘Her Morning Elegance’ was synched to a Chevrolet Malibu TV campaign. Oren, who does not own a television and has not driven a car for 10 years, continues to ride the bus. With the earnings from the TV ad he started his own label in the US, named it, then renamed it, changed it again and finally decided to call it Quarter Past Wonderful. He then released The Opposite Side Of The Sea on iTunes US, where it climbed to #30 on the charts.

&gt; Oren Lavie's music doesn't come right at you through the front door; its elliptical nature is mysterious and dense and remains slightly unresolved. His vignettes of life are heartbreaking. One can hear his playwright past in his narratives as his songs unfold like a collection of short stories in musical poetic form.

&gt; Life began for Kamasi Washington on February 18, 1981 in Los Angeles, California. In the Washington family music was more of a prerequisite than a privilege. But Kamasi never saw it that way, his love for music began at first sound. His father, Rickey Washington is a professional saxophonist by night and a high school music teacher by day. Kamasi’s mother, Valerie Washington is an accomplished flutist who fell in love with the world of science and became a high school chemistry teacher after her stint as a genetic researcher. By the age of two Kamasi had already began to play the drums and piano, the only thing that kept him away from the wind instruments at that early age was his lack of dental development. He began his exploration into the world of the reeds and brass when he was about seven and his father gave him a clarinet. By the age of twelve Kamasi had found his voice in the form of a tenor saxophone, in fact it was the same saxophone that his father played in high school. 

&gt; Over the next year Kamasi’s development and devotion to music had out grown his academic environment. So he transferred from The Los Angeles Center of Enriched Studies (one the top academic high schools in the nation) and enrolled into the Hamilton High School Music Academy. It was around this time that Kamasi also joined The Multi School Jazz Band (M.S.J.B.), an assembly of the finest young jazz musicians in Los Angeles County and led by Reginald Andrews the same man that taught Kamasi’s father in high school. Because of the sheer vastness of talent that he was surrounded by it was in The Multi School Jazz Band that Kamasi was most inspired during his high school years. Through M.S.J.B. Kamasi was also able to meet, learn, and create relationships with many of his musical idols such as Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Horse Tapscot, Gerald Wilson, and many others. In Kamasi’s senior year of high school he had the opportunity to compete in the John Coltrane Saxophone competition, in which he received the first place award. As an additional benefit to winning the competition the band of M.S.J.B. members that he assembled to accompany him had such an immediate connection that they decided to stay together and form a group that soon after would be known as “The Young Jazz Giants”. 
This fiery group of “Young Giants” wasted no time in spreading their musical wings and flying all over the Los Angeles jazz scene spreading the good news that jazz was still alive and in very good hands. It was during this time that Kamasi became interested in composition and he started writing his own music. Over the next year “The Young Jazz Giants” had really began to develop their own sound and were creating a lot of excitement in their community. 

&gt; After graduating from high school Kamasi began his studies at U.C.L.A. were the facility included some of the finest musicians in the history of Jazz, such as Kenny Burrell, Billy Higgins, Harold Land, Lew Mathews, Garnett Brown, Jeff Clayton, Gerald Wilson, and many others. By the end of his first year at U.C.L.A. Kamasi began performing with many of his professors. In fact he joined Gerald Wilson’s big band and later became the only member of his regular Los Angeles band to be invited to play on his latest album “In My Time” which was recorded in New York. During the summer after Kamasi’s first year at U.C.L.A. the head of a new record label called “Bird Man Records” heard him playing with “The Young Jazz Giants” and became very interested in making an album with the group. So Kamasi recorded his first album it was called The Young Jazz Giants. The completion of the album seemed like the “big break” for “The Young Jazz Giants” but unforeseen delays in the products release ended in the album being released almost two years after its completion. Ironically the talent level of the group was far too high for any of the members of the band to stay “ready and waiting” for too long, thus “The Young Jazz Giants” unofficially disbanded. 

&gt; Kamasi began to take interest and became influenced by many other forms of music, from European Classical to Hip Hop. This really opened his mind to the fact that all of the different forms that music takes are equally relevant. From this Kamasi ended up playing with many of the most legendary musicians of the current variety such as Snoop Dog, Raphael Saadiq, and many others. Yet during this time Kamasi despite his newfound respect for all of the forms of music realized that Jazz was still the music that was closest to his heart. So he started a new band that would be able to play the new music that he is creating. The new group is called “The Next Step” and that’s precisely what Kamasi intends on taking. 

&gt; (2) Kamasi Washington didn't pick up a saxophone until he was 13 years old, but by that point, he'd been playing several other instruments. That's when he found his calling. Within a couple years, he was the lead tenor saxophonist at Hamilton High School Music Academy in his native Los Angeles. After graduation, he attended UCLA to study ethnomusicology. While enrolled at UCLA, he recorded a self-titled album with Young Jazz Giants, a quartet he had formed with Cameron Graves and brothers Ronald Bruner, Jr. and Stephen ""Thundercat"" Bruner, released in 2004. From that point, Washington continually performed and recorded with an impressive variety of major artists across several genres, including Snoop Dogg, Raphael Saadiq, Gerald Wilson, McCoy Tyner, George Duke, and PJ Morton. In 2014 alone, Washington demonstrated tremendous range with appearances on Broken Bells' After the Disco, Harvey Mason's Chameleon, Stanley Clarke's Up, and Flying Lotus' You're Dead!, among other albums that covered indie rock, contemporary and progressive jazz, and experimental electronic music. 

&gt;  The following year, Washington contributed to Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly and finally debuted as a leader with The Epic, released on Flying Lotus' Brainfeeder label. An expansive triple album nearly three hours in duration, it involved the other three-quarters of Young Jazz Giants -- by then part of his larger ten piece collective, altnerately known as The Next Step and West Coast Get Down-- string orchestra and choir conducted by Miguel Atwood-Ferguson. 

&gt;  The Epic was a critical and commerial success. Not only did it land at number three on the jazz charts, it also found its way on to independent albums and heatseekers charts as well. Washington and his band were not only able to tour the U.S., but to play in Europe and Japan as well. ~ Andy Kellman

&gt; Glasgow’s C Duncan, born 1989, is the son of two classical musicians. Surrounded by music throughout his childhood, Christopher initially took up piano and viola. His teens led him to school bands – learning to play guitar, bass and drums – but did little to quell his fascination with the composition and performance of classical music. He eventually enrolled in Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland) to study music composition, where his pieces were performed by various ensembles across the UK.

&gt; To hear C Duncan’s music now is to grasp those two common threads between his interests in classical and modern music. The pieces that make up his forthcoming debut LP are formed from lush choral harmonies and acoustic instrumentation, textured like contemporary dreampop and all recorded at home in Glasgow on his bedroom studio setup, gradually built up one layer and one instrument at a time. The results of this methodical and isolationist recording process give us charming lo-fi folk with the harmonic width of choral composition, the sweetness of barbershop and the rough eloquence that has so readily soundtracked Glasgow over the past decades.

&gt; Christopher is also an accomplished painter, naming Grant Wood and Gerhard Richter as influences. His work has been exhibited throughout Scotland and he provides cover art for his own records, expressing the same musical ideas through painted image. Read more on Last.fm.

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/44d42242ea024df68f0cbb25dd68dcda.png)  

&gt; Aimee Mann (born September 8, 1960, in Richmond, Virginia) is an American rock singer-songwriter, guitarist and bassist.

&gt; Mann attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out to sing with her first punk rock band, the Young Snakes; the band released the EP Bark Along with the Young Snakes in 1982, and a compilation album was issued in 2004. In 1983, seeking a return to ""sweetness and melody"", she co-founded with Berklee classmate and boyfriend Michael Hausman the new wave band 'Til Tuesday, which achieved minor success in 1985 with its first album, Voices Carry. The title song is said to be inspired by Hausman and Mann's breakup; the video became an MTV staple, winning the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist, though Mann's signature spiky hair would lead some to dismiss the group. Mann performed with the rock band Rush on the song ""Time Stand Still"" (from Hold Your Fire, 1987), singing backup vocals and appearing in the music video. With Mann playing an increasingly important role in songwriting, 'Til Tuesday released two more albums, Welcome Home and Everything's Different Now. On the final album and tour, musician Jon Brion joined the band, which broke up in 1990 when Mann left to start her solo career.

&gt; Around the time of the first album's release, Mann began a romantic relationship with Jules Shear; they broke up before the final 'Til Tuesday album, which contained the song ""J For Jules"". Professional relationships from the band would continue: Hausman later became Mann's manager, and Brion produced her first two solo albums.

&gt; Solo career
In 1993, Mann released Whatever, her first solo album. Promotion suffered due to the collapse of her label, Imago. While only a small hit, the album was critically praised, and paved the way for her next release, 1995's I'm with Stupid, through Geffen Records. Again, reviews were positive, but sales were weak.

&gt; Mann had met musician Michael Penn in the 1980s and with comparable songwriting styles and record-industry woes to share, they struck up a friendship during the recording of Stupid, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Around this time Brion produced her album Bachelor No. 2, but Geffen saw no hit singles in the material and ordered her back to the studio. The album languished while Mann and the label fought.

&gt; Meanwhile, iconoclastic film auteur Paul Thomas Anderson, for whom Penn and Brion had composed a soundtrack, became a close friend. Mann gained greater public recognition in 1999 — indeed, more than anything else since ""Voices Carry"" — when she contributed eight songs to the soundtrack of Anderson's Magnolia, including the Academy Award-nominated song, ""Save Me"". Anderson deliberately worked from Mann's lyrics to create the film's characters and situations. Due to this exposure, Mann became sought after to contribute to soundtracks, a success made ironic by the music industry's indifference.

&gt; Independence
Fed up with both ineffectual promotion and artistic meddling by her record label, an experience documented in her song ""Calling It Quits"", she struck out on her own and founded SuperEgo Records in 1999. Mann self-released Bachelor No. 2 in 2000 (see 2000 in music), having negotiated a contract release from Geffen, and though initially only sold at concerts and via her website, the album became successful, allowing her to secure retail distribution through SuperEgo. The album, which included some songs from Magnolia and new material, was widely admired and Mann's ""more indie than indie"" success was carefully noted by other musicians.

&gt; Mann, Penn, Brion, Fiona Apple, and other musicians had by this time developed a subculture around the Largo nightclub in L.A. Penn and Mann formed a concept called Acoustic Vaudeville to recreate it on tour in California and eventually on an irregular, ongoing national tour. The Acoustic Vaudeville shows intermix music and stand-up comedy; among the comedians joining them for individual shows were Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt, and David Cross.

&gt; Aimee continued her solo career with Lost in Space (2002), a somewhat more sombre album in the same vein as Bachelor No. 2. In 2004 her website released the Lost in Space Special Edition, which featured a second disc containing six live recordings, as well two B-sides and two previously unreleased songs. In November of that year Live at St. Ann's Warehouse, a live album and DVD recorded at a series of July 2004 shows in Brooklyn, came out; the two discs were sold packaged together in either a CD jewel case or a DVD case.

&gt; Mann described her next album, The Forgotten Arm (2005) as a concept album set in the '70s about two lovers who meet at the Virginia state fair and are now on the run. The Joe Henry-produced album, which was recorded mostly live and has few overdubs, was released May 3, 2005. The album reflects Mann's interest in boxing in its illustrations as well as its title, derived from a boxing move in which one arm is used to hit the opponent, causing him to ""forget"" about the other arm, which is then used to deliver a harsher blow. The album received weaker reviews overall, with critics impressed at the totality but unimpressed with any individual songs.

&gt; In October 2006 Aimee released 'One More Drifter in The Snow', an album of Christmas songs. All bar one of the songs, 'Calling on Mary' were covers of holiday classics. 

&gt; Mann's independence from the industry led her to more explicit political stances. She joined Artists Against Piracy, a group formed to act against the illegal downloading and file sharing of copyrighted music from the Internet. Mann, Penn and Hausman took their experience with SuperEgo to found the independent music collective United Musicians, which is based on the principle that every artist should be able to retain copyright ownership of the work he or she has created, in contrast to normal music industry contracts.

&gt; June 2008 brought the release of '@#%&amp;*! Smilers,' a collection of songs featuring greater use of keyboards.  Aimee's set at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the same month featured a number of selections from the new album as well as a number of her concert standards.  Aimee and her band covered Elton John's 'My Father's Gun' as part of the set.

&gt; A Hamilton, Ontario-based electronic pop group, Junior Boys began as a duo with its duties split between Jeremy Greenspan and Johnny Dark. Influenced by a number of music sectors — including arty synthpop, minimal techno, uk garage, and contemporary hip-hop — they made a demo with no positive results. Dark opted to leave the group, but former Warp employee Nick Kilroy eventually heard the songs and became interested enough to begin his KIN label with Junior Boys as its first artist. Engineer Matt Didemus joined Greenspan, and together they recorded enough material for a full-length. Prior to the 2004 release of the resulting album, titled Last Exit, a pair of 12"" singles were released — one included a remix from Fennesz, while the other featured a remix from Manitoba (now Caribou).

&gt; Three months after Last Exit's initial U.K. release, Domino picked up the album for distribution in the U.S. The Domino version added a bonus disc with B-sides and remixes from the 12"" releases. The relatively slick So This Is Goodbye followed in 2006. The single ""In The Morning"" was featured in an iTunes commercial in 2007.

&gt; On July 10, 2007, Junior Boys second album was revealed as being on the shortlist for the 2007 Polaris Music Prize. They did not ultimately win the prize.

&gt; In September 2008, Morgan Geist's album ""Double Night Time"" was released with five songs performed by Jeremy Greenspan.

&gt; On April 7, 2009, the duo released their third full length album, Begone Dull Care on Domino records. The album is named for a short film by Academy Award-winning National Film Board animator Norman McLaren. The front cover gives the band name in French, along with Caprice en Couleurs, the French title of the film; the entirety of the liner notes is presented bilingually, including song titles.

&gt; On June 13, 2011, Junior Boys released It's All True. It is the fourth studio album.      You are viewing an older version of this page, from 23 May 2016, 1:29. You might like to view the latest version. The music belongs to oren maizlin and only.    Read more on Last.fm.

Curious - a few times you've used the term ""indie music"" to refer to stuff that wasn't punk in the 1980s. Is that what the academy is calling it now, or was it a label that was actually applied back then? 

I'm asking because I was into that stuff in the 1980s, and we only ever called it ""alternative"" in my cohort. Anything that would appear first on MTV's *120 Minutes* was ""alternative."" I don't remember ""indie"" becoming a distinct genre until sometime in the mid-90s, and then it was mostly applied to groups that sounded like the twee bands Nirvana sometimes covered, like The Raincoats or The Vaselines.  

There were independent labels, but they were usually still affiliated with one subculture or another (punk for SST and Alternative Tentacles, ""death rock"" or ""alternative"" for 4AD, art rock or ""college rock"" for Pitch-a-Tent or Ralph, and so on...).

I mean, this is my recollection, so I'm curious if I'm off here.

(There's also a whole lot about Albini's relationship with Nirvana and populism that we could dig into - he said some pretty controversial things about Nirvana right after working with them, then kind of backed away from that in the decades following. But the whole dynamic of ""selling out"" in the context of creating an album for wide release is so paradoxical to begin with....)

&gt; Mission of Burma is an American post-punk band formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1979. The band was formed by Roger Miller (guitar), Clint Conley (bass), Peter Prescott (drums) and Martin Swope (tape manipulator/sound engineer). Miller, Conley and Prescott share singing and songwriting duties. Like many of their post-punk contemporaries, Mission of Burma's efforts are largely concerned with extending punk's original vocabulary without losing its essential rebellious spirit. Using rapid shifts in dynamics, unconventional time signatures and chord progressions along with tape effects, Mission of Burma challenges the prevailing idioms of punk while attempting to retain its power and immediacy.

&gt; In early years the band's audience was limited to the Boston area, with all their recordings released on the small Boston-based record label Ace of Hearts. Despite initial success, Mission of Burma disbanded in 1983 due to Miller's development of tinnitus caused by the volume of the band's live performances. The band released only one album in its original form, Vs.. Mission of Burma reformed in 2002, with Bob Weston replacing Swope, and has since recorded two more albums, ONoffON and The Obliterati.

&gt; Their wall-of-noise musical sound extended the vocabulary of punk while continuing to hold clear its sense of power and abandon.  They used a number of tape effects, different chord progressions, and time shifts to highlight their formal training in music.  Not only that but they are seen now as a highly influential band to both post-punk and experimental music to come after; many bands cite Burma as an inspiration, including Nirvana, Superchunk, Creed, The Grifters, R.E.M. (who regularly covered ""Academy Fight Song"" on their Green tour), Sonic Youth, Throwing Muses, Yo La Tengo, Soul Asylum, Pixies, Sugar, Catherine Wheel, Guided by Voices, Graham Coxon and Moby - the last two of which have covered """"That's When I Reach For My Revolver.""

&gt; The band were due to tour in 1980 with Joy Division but the suicide of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's singer, canceled the tour. In 1983, after releasing their only full-length studio record Vs., the group disbanded due to Miller's worsening tinnitus.

&gt; The band found increasing relevance throughout the 90s, culminating in the publication of Michael Azzerad's essays Our Band Could Be Your Life which featured Mission of Burma. In 2002, they reunited and began playing reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and formerly Prescott's Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller relates that ""when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin's position, we told him he could use current digital technology which accomplishes Martin's antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted for maintaining the original integrity, and uses a tape deck.""

&gt; Makari is a progressive-rock band from South Florida, blending heartfelt lyrics with powerful melodies to create an infectious sound that is easy to enjoy and connect with.

&gt; Formation came naturally for the Tampa, FL base band, MAKARI. They came together sporadically in 2011 before going on tour under the name of Brandon and Lindsay’s previous project (Skyline Summer). “Eric, Kevin and I had played music together since high school, so when the opportunity came to work together again it just seemed natural. Soon after, John joined the band through his friendship with Lindsay,” stated Matt. “We had a very strong connection.” This was when MAKARI finalized their line-up and began their creative takeover.

&gt; Don’t let their forming in 2011 make you second guess their success. Last year MAKARI put together a hometown Christmas show and immediately sold it out. They’ve had the honor of working with Tilian Pearson (Tides of Man, Dance Gavin Dance), shared the stage with some of their genres biggest acts including We The Kings, La Dispute, Memphis May Fire, The Dangerous Summer, Go Radio and Set It Off and even completed and funded an entire US tour with no label backing. 

&gt; MAKARI’s upcoming release, See Dreams, is a beautifully composed five song EP that purely engages your curiosity. “See Dreams reflects our fascination with how the moon and the sea work together to keep everything going,” says Eric. “We wanted to write something youthful but also something beautiful.” The band called on the one and only Brooks Paschal (VersaEmerge, The Academy Is…) to record the EP in Tyler, TX.

&gt; “We want to play our music around the world and get a chance to see the world through music. We want to have kids quote our lyrics and be someone that kids look up to like we did when we were younger,” says Eric. “We can’t believe that in such a short time together, that we have made this amount of friends and fans.”

&gt; Be careful. After one listen to MAKARI’s music, you’ll refuse to rest until you see their bursting chemistry and heart racing energy onstage. With plans to meet the rest of the world you can certainly expect to see MAKARI’s alluring presence on a stage near you soon.

Do you find that game reporters and game designers are talking about games in the same way, or are there ways you wish one group would adapt or change to better communicate with the other - designer to reporter or vice versa?

&gt;I don’t think it’s just designers and reporters. There’s lots of kinds of people who talk about games. Designers, business people, journalists, players. And there are different arenas too - game design meetings, conference talks, online articles, question sessions, internal monologue. There are huge gaps between all of them.

&gt;Even the things I express to you guys here, even when I’m trying to explain a whole design process, are quite different from the internal self-talk I go through when I’m thinking of the problem and trying to solve it. The self-talk is far faster, richer, and more complex and references way more concepts than anything I can write. I’ve thought of trying to transcribe that self-talk more effectively but the prospect just seems exhausting and essentially impossible because nearly every sentence would be in reference to some concept or reference experience which itself would require a paragraph or twenty to describe, thus requiring more and more references.

&gt;Ultimately it’s impossible to break out a piece of your mind because every piece depends on the others; it’s all or nothing. So when expressing anything about a design I think we all try to couch it in terms of the concepts and reference experiences that the listener is expected to already know.

&gt;The trouble is that (aside from a rather small group of gamers and developers and a few journalists) what the vast majority of people already know is movies and novels and childhood stories. So everything in games gets expressed in terms of these other linear story media. Which is incredibly limiting. That’s the language gulf right there.

&gt;It’s like someone who sees in color explaining the appearance of Japanese sakura blossoms to someone who is monochrome-colorblind. Now imagine a world where 98% of the population is monochrome-colorblind and try to think of what the popular discourse about sakura blossoms would be in such a world. Even when a color-vision person was in the discussion, he’s still explain in black-and-white terms because those are the terms that everyone can understand. In such a world the true beauty of the sakura would never be publicly discussed or understood.

&gt;Sometimes that’s how I feel we have to talk about game design. Everyone has an education in traditional stories, from near birth onward all the way through high school literature classes and so on. The language of games isn’t taught, must be learned alone, and when it is learned there’s no discussion on it because most parties in the discussion need everything couched in linear story terms to understand what’s being said.

&gt;It’s a major limiting factor in how game designers are expanding what the medium is doing and how we think about it. However, I also think it’s an opportunity for designers who can see the gaps in the possibility space that are being left open by the mainstream language- gaps I’m personally glad to try to fulfill!

* Tynan, as cew-smoke already asked about tools and after reading your AMA on reddit. I was wondering how many “prototype” games you’ve started before RimWorld? 

 I mean everything you’ve started, not necessarily finished. From practice, to failures that go straight to recycle bin, to “real” games that you later found out weren’t going to work out. It’s easy to find your released mods and games by now, but I’m interested in the overall work you have behind being able to create an amazing game like RimWorld.

&gt;Let’s see.

&gt;There was the zombie survival world roguelike RPG.

&gt;There was Warlock TV, the music-synchronized top-down arena combat game.

&gt;https://youtu.be/AwVmNNKv86w

&gt;There was Wizard Academy, which was a 2D block builder game where you manage a Hogwarts-like wizard school.

&gt;There was Mercenary Manager, the economics-and-tactics game about managing a team of mercenaries.

&gt;There was Starship Architect, the game about building a ship in 2D, block by block, and flying it around doing stuff.

&gt;Then that became RimWorld when it was placed on the planet surface.

&gt;So, in the latest batch of prototypes from 2012, it looks like RimWorld was the sixth one! All this was done in about a 7 month period from summer 2012 to February 2013.

* In regards to Rimworld what came to you first? Was it the setting and then you built the gameplay around that or did you have the idea of a survival like game first that you then built a setting around.

 Also are there any features that you either wish you included earlier or were hard to implement and had to be cut?

&gt;Originally it was a game about building starships. Only after that did I move the ship to a planet’s surface and make it a colony. So it’s hard to say what came first. Neither, really. They sort of came from the same place, historically.

&gt;I’m pretty happy with the features. I’m really systematic in how I choose what to do - I keep a comparative list of all the possible additions and do written analyses on features to decide what to add - so there haven’t been any disaster features that needed cutting. Just some tweaking here and there. Not everything gets loved by players as much as I’d hope, but everything tends to work.

&gt;The last time I really had to cut something big that I can remember was the airlock system from Starship Architect. That’s where I learned not to add designs that require colonists to chain together tasks to do things (e.g. to repair ship hull-&gt;cycle airlock first) because it’s too hard to write the AI to be smart about it.

* I have a much better understanding of game design and game playing after reading your book, really. I will read it again a third time after knowing about your great success with RimWorld.

 Did you learned any lesson your should put in a second edition, if you had time to write it?

&gt;If I wrote it again I’d probably do it quite differently overall. I’d focus a lot more on some things and drop some other discussions that just aren’t useful. I’d also be able to add a lot of day-to-day practical stories about indie development.

&gt;Still, I’m happy with the state of the book. It’s got a lot of ideas that I still use, for sure. If I wrote another one it’d have the same ideas under the surface, but probably with a more simple nitty-gritty presentation and a bit less abstraction.

* I've heard you say you liked Persona 4 Golden a lot, so my first thing will be the [first Trails of Cold Steel game](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-of-cold-steel/cid=UP1023-PCSE00786_00-EDSENNOKISEKIRLS). It's about a group of nine military academy students travelling across an extremely well built world learning how to be soldiers while getting into relationships with eachother. You can talk to your classmates individually to learn more about them, there's a really enjoyable tactical battle system, and it's a quite long game (and the sequel is due out in...literally a week from now). So I figure you'd be at least partially enjoying it. Careful though - all of the Trails games take place in the same world, and this takes place after the Trails in the Sky duology, so if you ever plan to play those, they'll be spoiled outright.

* Looking for something a bit sci-fi like? Ever played [Steins;Gate](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/steinsgate/cid=UP4293-PCSE00644_00-STEINSGATE00000A)? It's a pure visual novel (not Zero Escape like where you'll have puzzle sections) about a group of misfits who somehow manage to discover time travel and get themselves tangled in a massive conspiracy. There's plot twist after plot twist and there isn't a single character that isn't at least really likeable. Not to mention the voice acting (Japanese only) is *really good*, so that helps.

* I think I've heard you talk about Vanillware before, since they're basically the 2D equivalent of Platinum, but I'll recommend [Muramasa Rebirth](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/muramasa-rebirth-complete-collection/cid=UP1024-PCSE00240_00-B000000000000854), [Dragon's Crown](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/dragon's-crown/cid=UP0005-PCSE00019_00-DRAGONSCROWN0001) and [Odin Sphere's remake](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/odin-sphere-leifthrasir/cid=UP0177-PCSE00899_00-ODINSPHERELE0000) just to be safe. The first is the port of the Wii game, but it has four extra DLC characters with their own short stories and then they can fight every boss in the main game. Dragon's Crown is a Diablo-ish 4 player brawler that's heavy on the medieval parody (gotta love the stage that's just a giant Holy Grail reference) and Odin Sphere is a remake of the original Norse mythology PS2 game with new combat and presentation. They all play and run pretty damn well, I keep all 3 on my backup Vita so when I can finally get around to playing them, I will...also, don't forget they have a fourth game coming to Vita sometime this year for Japan (so early/mid next year for us?)

* You like arcade shooters that you can pick up and put down in the space of ten minutes? Boy, there's a lot of those. [The port of Geometry Wars 3 is damn well perfect.](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/geometry-wars-3-dimensions-evolved/cid=UP0002-PCSE00655_00-GEOMETRYWARS3PSV) [Jeff Minter's magnum opus, TxK, runs like a treat.](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/txk/cid=UP4461-PCSE00397_00-LLAMASOFTTXK0001) [Dariusburst Chronicle Saviours is intensely challenging, but even more intensely rewarding when you finally finish a stage.](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/dariusburst-chronicle-saviours/cid=UP1056-PCSE00792_00-DARIUSBURSTCS0US) And you've done WTF is videos on [Big Sky Infinity (Really Big Sky)](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/big-sky-infinity/cid=UP2070-PCSE00091_00-UBIGSKYINF000001), [Sine Mora](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/sine-mora/cid=UP4175-PCSE00090_00-SINEMORATRIAL001) and [Crimsonland](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/crimsonland/cid=UP4403-PCSE00453_00-CRIMSONLAND11111) before, and while you didn't enjoy these games extensively, if you ever wanted to pick either of them up again, they're there.

* I'm sure you're aware of both [Earth Defense Force 2: Invaders from Planet Space](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/earth-defense-force-2-invaders-from-planet-space/cid=UP1023-PCSE00710_00-EARTHDEFENFORCE2) and [Earth Defense Force 2017 Portable](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/earth-defense-force-2017-portable/cid=UP0367-PCSE00209_00-EDF2017PORTABLE0). But I'll just mention them anyway. They're great to just play a stage or two and then put them down again.

* If you're fine with doing Japanese imports I have a couple of recommendations, since the Vita's region free and all. If you want an...interesting rhythm game, check out [the Vita version of Taiko no Tatsujin](http://www.play-asia.com/taiko-no-tatsujin-v-version/13/708qtb). If you want Dynasty Warriors combined with Diablo-ish looting combined with those damn plastic Gundam models Dodger is always on about, try [Gundam Breaker](http://www.play-asia.com/gundam-breaker-3-english-subs/13/709u4t). You want something your wife will get annoyed at you for playing? [Moe Chronicle, my man.](http://www.play-asia.com/moe-chronicle-chinese-english-sub/13/708k51)

* There's a bunch of other games, too, that I don't know if you'll like or not, but that I would literally recommend to EVERYBODY who gets a Vita, so I'll just list them off for you. [Wipeout 2048](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/wipeout-2048/cid=UP9000-PCSA00015_00-WIPEOUT2048BASE0), the best game in the series and an utter disappointment considering Studio Liverpool isn't around to make any more. [Shiren the Wanderer](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/shiren-the-wanderer-the-tower-of-fortune-and-the-dice-of-fate/cid=UP1024-PCSE00845_00-SHIREN5PLUS0000E) while being a roguelike is wonderfully tricky, and has a replay value in that you don't -have- to lose everything you have when you die. [Superbeat Xonic](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/superbeat-xonic/cid=UP2011-PCSE00717_00-SUPERBEATXONIC02) is the best music game on Vita bar none, from the DJ MAX guys. Has Guilty Gear/BlazBlue/Magical Beat music as DLC. [Mobile Suit Gundam: Extreme Vs Force](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/mobile-suit-gundam-extreme-vs-force-bundle/cid=UP0700-PCSE00915_00-VSTABUNDLE000000) is the first in the VS series we have over here and it's basically just crazy awesome robot fights. I keep coming back to the Course Battle mode even after finishing the main campaign. [Trillion God of Destruction](https://store.playstation.com/#!/en-us/games/trillion-god-of-destruction/cid=UP0031-PCSE00813_00-TRILLIONGOD00000) is a silly princess-management style game combined with permadeath and strategy battles, but it has some of the best character writing I've read in a while, and they did a really good job with the English dub. Shinobido 2 (you'll have to get it via eBay, the digital license expired) is stealthy ninja crafting goodness from the people who made Tenchu. Virtua Tennis 4, the port is really good, but again, the digital license is gone.

And I mean, there's even more good stuff. Disgaea, Digimon, the Atelier games, every Dynasty Warriors game in the past while (minus a couple of notable ones, damn you Shin Gundam Musou), the Sly Collection and God of War collection are good ports, Soul Sacrifice Delta and Toukiden are great for just killing time, every indie you find is more likely to be a good port than not if you need a reason to get back into them.

I know there's issues like memory cards and price and some of these games not being to your taste, but hey, if I could come from entirely playing Western games like I had a rod up my butt six something years ago to enjoying the hell out of everything I've just listed here, there's got to be something good going on, right? Let me know if you plan on looking at anything. Hope I helped.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,t3_4zt4tp,,,,,,,,,,,1472350486.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1473640298.0,,,

One of the complaints I've had with my other cans is that they tend to do mids and highs quite well, but the sub-bass isn't as impactful. The Fostex manages to introduce a level of sub-bass that I've never experienced on headphones before, while also maintaining excellent mid-range timbre and having the recessed highs that I desire—to prevent listener's fatigue. The sound-stage isn't wide, but it's not as narrow as I expected, based on reviews from other individuals. Regardless, the stereo imaging is still impressive. I listen to a decent variety of music, so I've spent a good amount of time trying an amalgam of headphones. That being said, I'll cover my perceptions of these headphones in relation to the music I've listened to more recently.  

**Rock/Metal**  
Daily, I listen to a lot of prog-rock (e.g. Polyphia, Intervals, CHON, Strawberry Girls, Sithu Aye), j-rock (e.g. SCANDAL, GARNiDELiA, LiSA), and metal (e.g. Periphery, Northlane). Many of the bands which I listen to are very instrumentally driven or very vocal-driven. A fair bit of these bands have bass synths or bass guitar that is essential to the performance, and these cans really give the bass more impact. The guitars still maintain the mids and treble that are so important to their tone. Vocals sit in the mix very well, never overwhelmed by the bass. From time to time, I'll also indulge in some alternative, pop-punk or indie (e.g. The Hush Sound, The Academy Is..., The Rocket Summer, Mae). The experience is still very enjoyable with these cans.  

**Electronic/Pop/Rap**  
Nowadays, I don't listen to too many artists in this genre, but these cans do absolute justice. With a bit of EQ in the sub-bass, I have achieved some excellent physical impact on these cans. Listening to electronic albums like those from Seven Lions, Porter Robinson and Perfume are best enjoyed on the Fostex compared to my other cans, as the bass response is incredible. Listening to Kevin Gates and Childish Gambino, the bass tends to sustain and controlled rumbles become a lot more frequent. If you're a bass-head, there's no doubt that these cans are capable of giving you an excellent performance. If you choose to use an EQ, be careful not to drown out the mid range!  

Overall, I'm very glad I waited the 4+ months for these cans. My HD650's may take the backburner for a while...",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,t3_4zmf0x,,,,,,,,,TH-X00 PH | HD650 | K7XX | XPT100 | HD280 | QC35 |:| m9XX | E5,,1472179751.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1473605846.0,,,

Well since it has legendary special effects and music, it must now be on the top 100 list. Move over In The Mood for Love and A Separation!

Maybe a list of contemporary critics who look back at the 21st century and pick the films that have meant the most? OH WAIT, this list.

Probably because you aren't interested in writing a coherent rebuttal that doesn't focus on a biased award show and a site that is populated with 18-25 year olds.

&gt;Your argument relies on statistics and metrics that either don't exist 
   
Considering that the site of IMDB gives movies like The Dark Knight a 9/10 and is filled with garbage in it's top 250, it's hard to take seriously a site where most thought provoking art is voted lower while accessible genre efforts are given high praises.  

&gt;Just because the academy has mistakes does not mean it is not an effective measure of quality. 
  
Must be why 3/4ths of the Best Picture winners they've had have vanished in obscurity or have become footnotes.

Most of the foreign and indie films haven't and most of the ones that have are given one category as a fuck you to them.
  
&gt;You laugh them off.  
  
Yeah, because they're garbage. Believe it or not, IMDB ratings and what Hollywood Reporter thinks isn't what influences a film's reputation to grow.

No there's plenty of other valid alternatives from IMDB ratings and Oscars. Look at most valid academic critics think of a film, [something like this](http://old.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/feature/49593) is a lot more interesting to read than what IMDB or Metacritic thinks.  
  
&gt;and the award ceremonies love it then odds are it really is a genuinely great movie. 
  
And there's nothing wrong with thinking that it's a good movie, I never argued against that.

&gt; Cass McCombs (born in Concord, California in 1977) is an American singer-songwriter and performer.

&gt; An enigmatic folk nomad, McCombs is a quintessentially American artist; ""he's quietly become one of (the country's) finest chroniclers of fringe characters, a writer of heart-rending love songs and psychedelic odes to the natural world, a teller of tall-tales with a sense of humor dry as desert wood, and that rare folksinger who actually sings about the folk."" His vocals range somewhere between the anxious drone of Lou Reed, the hollow croon of Elliott Smith, the lilting melody of Morrissey, and the driving earnestness and complexity of bards such as Leonard Cohen or Bob Dylan. His lyrical style is alternately vivid and weary, laconic and yearning, or drifting into the high-spirited and whimsical.

&gt; After cutting his first EP, Not the Way in San Francisco in 2001, McCombs relocated to Baltimore, MD. There he released ""Not the Way"" in 2002 and recorded his first full-length, A, in 2003 on Monitor Records. He spent the next few years touring: playing All Tomorrow's Parties; and opening for bands such as Modest Mouse, The Decemberists, and Belle and Sebastian; before recording his second LP PREfection, which was released on 4AD in 2005. 

&gt; McCombs' subsequent releases have been on the highly successful British independent label Domino Recording Co. 2007's Dropping the Writ was named one of Amazon's Best Albums of that year. Catacombs was voted one of the 50 greatest albums of 2009 by Pitchfork Media, and features Academy Award-nominated actress and singer Karen Black on the track Dreams-Come-True-Girl. During this period, McCombs toured with the likes of Arcade Fire, Andrew Bird, Band of Horses, José González, Beach House, and The Walkmen.

&gt; Catacombs also established McCombs' relationship with engineer/producer Ariel Rechtshaid, member of The Hippos and Foreign Born, who produced Grammy-winning hit Climax for Usher, the Plain White T's Grammy-nominated No.1 platinum-selling single Hey There Delilah, and albums for Vampire Weekend, Sky Ferreira, Snoop Lion, and Haim, among others.

&gt; In 2010 McCombs played Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago, L.A.'s Culture Collide Festival and Invisible Children Benefit. 2011 offered an extensive headlining tour, an appearance at SXSW, and two albums released by McCombs and produced by Rechtshaid: Wit's End in April and Humor Risk in November. The two albums were made simultaneously. In an interview with Pitchfork, McCombs explains: ""Wit's End was started years ago and it slowly made its way to the finish line. Humor Risk was just punched out. They're friends but they're different. Wit's End is like a stew; Humor Risk is the raw food diet.""

&gt; Big Wheel and Others, McCombs' seventh full-length (and first double album) was released in October 2013. The album is rooted in the Americana mythos of the Wild West, from the San Francisco drug culture to the gunslingers and gold rush of the nineteenth century. The album once again features Karen Black on a version of the track Brighter!, her final recording before passing away due to ampullary cancer in August, 2013. Big Wheel is dedicated to her memory.

Other Music was dope though, no doubt, and I'm going to be sad when they fill it in with whatever it is they put there (like that John Varvatos store taking CBGB's location). :( 

If you're an RSD-goer, I highly recommend going to Turntable Lab for that day.  They have a really smooth operation going and you don't need to get there that early to snag a good spot.  They also price their indie records really friendly in comparison to a lot of the other stores (Bleecker Street, Record Runner ((?)on bleecker or w3rd just before you hit 6av S)). 

Academy on 12th and Turntable Lab are probably my two favorite stores in Manhattan.

If you happen to be super into hip-hop and soul music, Rock and Soul is LOADED with it as well as a pretty solid indie collection.  

I don't really like that Record Runner store, the new Bleecker Street location, or Rough Trade.

Good luck on your quest for that new nest!",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,t3_4wt782,,,,,,,,,,,1470703695.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1473298237.0,,,

&gt; One eskimO was ‘born’ in 2004 and is the brain child of Kristian Leontiou.  At the time Kristian was at the end of promoting his debut album: Some Day Soon (Polydor) which sold over 200,000 copies. His debut single (Story Of My Life) also went Top 10 in the UK singles chart.  Kris (as he is known to his friends) grew up in the north-west suburbs of London, his first experiences of music coming from his older sisters, who would regularly shake the Leontiou household whilst practicing with their respective punk bands, in their bedrooms! At only 10 years old Kris was mesmerized when sisters Anna and Alex would sneak him in to watch them perform at venues like The Mean Fiddler.  When most kids were getting used to weekend lay-ins, at 14 Kristian had already developed a self survival ‘street’ mentality and had already undertaken work in an array of ‘grown up’ situations that not many so young are exposed to. The resulting attribute is someone very much of his own mind, a humble belief in his own visions creatively. Often he was a child in an adult’s world. It’s no surprise then at only 15, Kristian was introduced to recording studios, adding guest vocals on friend’s garage &amp; dance demos, and using any down time to begin his first explorations musically. His early and lasting influences on these initial compositions were acts like Arrested Development, The Fugees, REM, Groove Armada and Finlay Quay.   Working in various and unsatisfying dead-end jobs after leaving school, Kris went to the studio whenever he had any spare time, hoping it would one day pay off…and eventually it did.  In his late teens Kristian met by chance Mike Sault of Warner Chappell (Dido/Craig David/Groove Armada) who promptly offered a publishing deal. Kris went traveling around the country working with various producers searching for ‘his sound’ Sault eventually paired Kristian with Producer/Song writer Pete Wilkinson (credits include Paolo Nutini &amp; Amy Macdonald) of Melodramatic Records. Together, and with Pete’s wife Sarah, they wrote and produced the Some Day Soon album in Wilkinson’s ‘spare bedroom’ studio’  The initial bedroom demos got a great and instant response from many labels and in late 2002 Kris signed to Polydor (home of Ian Brown and Snow Patrol) within a matter of weeks; Polydor had the album mixed/mastered and promptly started promoting his first single which entered the charts at no. 9. Growing up as a studio based singer, Kristian suddenly found himself on stage for the first time in his life (Islington Academy – 1000+ capacity) performing to what felt like a million people including the press, the music industry, friends, and family. In his own words ""it was the worst performance of my life, I was way too under prepared’ these days it’s a very different story ‘I feel free on stage today’ says Kristian in 2007 ‘I feel I’m meant to be up there, like I belong, back then I felt very nervous and extremely vulnerable’  During a long promotional tour for the Album throughout the UK and Europe Kris was finding it increasingly difficult emotionally ‘I began to feel like I was promoting an album that didn't really represent or ‘belong’ to me. It didn’t say anything about my personality, and musically I longed to sound more like me, whatever that was’  Kristian has always been a free spirit but at that time felt like his life was being micro managed with advice on what he said, wore, did and sang. He craved creative expression but was on a ‘good looking young man’ pop-music treadmill, one that many before him had found a false and a crushing experience.   On a flight back from L.A. in late 2004 Kristian had the flash of light that was the concept and creative birth of One eskimO ‘With absolutely no compromise’ he said ‘I wanted to create a sound of my own, magical, ambient, filmic, acoustic, beautiful and meaningful. I wanted to write about how I felt, life, love, losses &amp; failures, highs and lows, even heartbreaks. But also about how amazing human life is and how mind blowing our very existence is’.  ‘I also had my own visual interpretation of the music, for an animated visual to run alongside the music, telling magical stories with a childlike innocence whilst creating a sonic ‘journey’ for everyone. ‘Even if just for a moment, I want people to hear this and feel like it did before anything mattered in life, when they were truly free, when they were children’  The One eskimO sound was developed in a Battersea studio along side good friend - Craigie Dodds (credits include Sugababes) they took their time working with sounds and beats and soon came up with the song ‘Chocolate’.  ""This song just sums up that period in my life; this was the first proper song and just the right sound for One eskimO!"".  At the same time Kristian teamed up with Adam Falkner – experienced session musician/drummer and unbeknown to him soon to become a giraffe! They started rehearsing a live set, every detail was considered, including what everything would look and sound like for the audiences. With Kristian’s right hand man now on guitar - Martin Waugh (soon to be the penguin in the growing animal line-up) they were also lucky enough to now know Jamie Sefton who was a wizard on bass &amp; horns, he also joined and rather inevitably, become the monkey. The band was formed.   Meanwhile a mutual friend had introduced Kristian to Rollo Armstrong (faithless/dido and many more) Kristian asked Rollo directly and politely to get involved in the album, and a very reluctant Rollo agreed to take a listen to One eskimO demos. Upon hearing the song ‘Astronauts’ he immediately opted in and ended up co-producing the album with Kristian. The team was starting to mirror the vision.   At this time, it became clear that Kristian’s idea of an eskimO world and animated videos didn't really fit with the Polydor vision of a radio friendly ‘Kristian Leontiou’ so they respectfully and amicably parted company.   With the One eskimO demos completed, the band wanted to record the album how any self respecting musicians would, together and completely live. They recorded alongside ‘ark’ (Rollo/Marky Bates/ Grippa) with Phil Brown (credits include Bob Marley) engineering and all had a great time doing it. After a month of recording the band, Kristian went to Rollo’s personal ‘ark’ studios where together they spent a further year experimenting with sounds, textures, and adding lots of magic eskimO dust! 
In 2007 Martin was ‘lost in a snowstorm’ which in reality translates to Mika (who he also played guitar for) shooting to fame. He was promptly replaced by the exceptionally gifted guitarist Pete Rinaldi and what felt like a loss became a huge win ‘Pete makes us complete’ says Kris. Through a series of 'happy accidents"" Kristian met Nathan Erasmus who had just formed Gravy Media, quite literally an ‘independent company’ operating from people’s bedrooms and lounges. Gravy Media was formed with Erasmus’s childhood friend Phil Menni, together and from an early age they both shared an obsessive love for illustration and animation.  It was Nathan’s shared love of the eskimO sound that inspired the intricate visual voyages of family, innocence and magic that became the first One eskimO video. It sits alongside the stunning single ‘Hometime’   

&gt; You now know the eskimO…hello.

There... is really a lot of amazing and great titles. In my opinion, one of the nicest things I've enjoyed about PC is that a lot of the games that are exclusive end up on PC anyways and usually there is tons of mods to revive the game and extend its playability. Anyways... here's a few I can think of (based off my library).

* Age of Empires 2 HD might be worth checking out. 

* If you like city building sims then I'd check out Cities:Skylines. 

* Risk of Rain is a lot of fun. I'm not good at describing it, but you can look into it and some gameplay videos on YouTube.

* Bad Company 2 might be worth looking at if you enjoy Battlefield or FPS games. 

* Stardew Valley is inspired by Harvest Moon if you are interested in something like that. 

* Prison Architect is fun for all your prison building needs. 

* Supreme Commander 2 is a lot of fun. Similar to Age of Empires, but has a bit more content I think. 

* Knights of the Old Republic I and II are fantastic RPG's and helps with your Star Wars fantasies. Some of the stuff is weird (controls, combat, etc.) but if you can get past that it should be a blast. 

* Gunpoint is a great indie game. It takes a unique concept and morphs it into a fun little challenge. 

* Papers Please is a really fun game. Similar to gunpoint in the fact that it is very unique. Tests how ""attentive"" you are.

* Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition is definitely worth picking up. Recently there was a huge community revival in it and there is still people playing in it last I checked. Though I definitely recommend downloading DSFix to fix it's FPS and stability issues. 

* Deus Ex: Human Revolution AND the original Deus Ex. Both are fantastic. I actually haven't played the original, but if people are saying it isn't as good as Human Revolution... I know it's gonna be amazing. Both have interesting plots and offer a wide range of variety of choices when it comes to gameplay and story. Definitely Recommend. (Cyberpunk styled)

* Binding of Issac: Rebirth + DLC: Great rogue like if you haven't already picked it up on PS4 (if it's available there... which I think it is). 

* Of course... this list would never be complete without Half Life 2. Half Life 2 in a sense partially made the game industry what it is today. (but of course it didn't encourage the shady and crappy business practices today) 

* Some of the old Star Wars games are spectacular. I recommend picking up Battlefront 2, Jedi Outcast, and Jedi Academy. Make sure if you get Academy to get the Movie Battles 2 mod with it. There's a [lot of fun](https://youtu.be/mOT5J45vHIA) when it comes to multiplayer with Movie Battles. 

* Hotline Miami 1 and 2 satisfy your crazy ""I'd like to bash everyone's heads in over and over"" side. Definitely satisfying and a challenge.

* Euro Truck Simulator 2 if you like driving on a highway and listening to music... and that's it. I know... it's kinda weird... but it's oddly satisfying for some.

* Orcs Must Die 2 is extremely fun. It's like a 3D tower defense... just look it up. It's fun :) 

* Skyrim. I know this is something you can play on most systems... but you can't beat the mods. Ya just can't...

I'll update if I think of a few more. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,t3_4q011r,,,,,,,,,,,1466987602.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1469316198.0,,,

He is known for his YouTube webseries JonTron, in which he reviews video games, movies, and television shows of varying genres in a fast, retrospective, and comedic manner. Jafari is also known for co-creating and co-hosting the Let's Play webseries Game Grumps, and co-creating the video game review website, NormalBoots. As of June 2016, Jafari has amassed over 2.6 million subscibers and 310 million views on his YouTube channel, JonTronShow.  
Jonathan Jafari was born and raised in Rancho Palos Verdes, a city in Los Angeles County, California. He attended Palos Verdes Peninsula High School from 2004 to 2008, where he participated in musical theatre.[2] While attending high school, Jafari met future collaborator Jirard Khalil and future Game Grumps editor Barry Kramer.[3][4] Jafari currently resides in Manhattan, New York.

Jafari created a Newgrounds account under the name ""BirdmanXZ6"" in 2003, and uploaded five animations depicting anthropomorphic onions.[5] In 2006, he made a YouTube account under the same name, which he later changed to ""TheOnionKing."" All but two of the videos on this channel have since been deleted.[6]  
In 2010, Jafari created a YouTube channel called JonTronShow.[7] He stated that he chose the name JonTron because it was ""reminiscent of technology,"" and that the show was originally going to be called JonTron 2.0.[8] He then uploaded a two-part review of Nintendo 64 game Daikatana, the first installment in his JonTron series. In each episode of JonTron, Jafari reviews singular games as well as games of a particular theme or genre. He is usually accompanied by his green-cheeked conure, Jacques, who speaks with a robotic voice. Jafari usually incorporates elements of sketch comedy into these episodes to display his reactions to the video game that he is reviewing. Jafari has reviewed numerous video game adaptations of popular franchises such as Hercules, Barbie, Home Alone, and Conan the Barbarian.[9] He has also reviewed various unlicensed games, particularly based on the Pokémon franchise as well as Disney films.[10][11] In the latter, he observed China as being ""farther away from U.S. jurisdiction and much better at Disney bootlegging"" and also remarked on unofficial online games based on the company's movies.[12] Jafari also occasionally uploads skits as well as movie reviews. His most popular video is ""Bootleg Pokémon Games"" with over ten million views.

In 2011, Jafari created two failed spin-off Let's Play channels. The first, ""JonTronStarcraft,"" has two videos of Jafari playing Blizzard Entertainment's popular RTS game StarCraft.[13] The second channel, ""JonTronLoL,"" has four videos of Jafari playing the MOBA game League of Legends.[14] Both channels have less than 25,000 subscribers.

JonTronShow reached one million subscribers in 2014.[14]

In May 2015, Jafari released a spin-off webseries on his YouTube channel titled JonTron's StarCade (often referred to simply as StarCade), in which he reviews games based on the Star Wars franchise.[15] The webseries included cameos from numerous other Internet personalities and actors, such as Egoraptor, Markiplier, Nathan Barnatt, Ross O'Donovan, and Kyle Hebert. The series was produced by Maker Studios, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company, and concluded in December 2015 after nine episodes.

Jafari occasionally uploads videos in which he comments on matters that he finds important, which are usually related to gaming. This occurred most recently in 2016, with Jafari's video entitled ""THE BLIZZARD RANT,"" in response to Blizzard Entertainment shutting down private servers of their popular MMORPG, World of Warcraft.[16] Jafari mostly criticized the shutdown of one of the most popular private servers, Nostalrius, which was a copy of the 1.12 version of the game.[17] Jafari's video helped create notablility on this subject, and lead to thousands of signatures on a Change.org petition regarding the shutdown of legacy servers in World of Warcraft.[18]

NormalBoots[edit]
NormalBoots was created in late 2010 by Jafari and Austin ""PeanutButterGamer"" Hargrave to act as a hub where Jafari and Hargrave could post content and receive advertisement revenue. Soon after its creation, NormalBoots added Did You Know Gaming?, The Completionist, Indie Games Searchlight, and Continue? to its roster of shows. The site was closed down in 2012, as Google's AdSense program offered better revenue options for the content creators.[19] NormalBoots was relaunched on January 24, 2014, with the addition of ProJared and Satchbag's Goods. However, Indie Games Searchlight was not included in the relaunch.[20]

Game Grumps[edit]
Main article: Game Grumps
In July 2012, Jafari and animator Arin ""Egoraptor"" Hanson, known for his Awesome, Sequelitis, and Girlchan in Paradise animations, announced they would be starting a Let's Play series titled Game Grumps through videos on both their channels. On the GameGrumps channel, Jafari and Hanson played games that were typically retro or nostalgic in style. On July 18 of the same year, Jafari and Hanson uploaded their first serials of Game Grumps: Kirby Super Star, Mega Man 7 and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past.[21] Due to Jafari and Hanson's existing fanbases, the show was quickly acclaimed by fans. However on June 25, 2013 it was revealed that, due to unspecified reasons as well as conflicts with JonTron, Jafari left Game Grumps and was replaced by Ninja Sex Party singer Leigh Daniel Avidan.[22] This was met with extreme backlash by fans, as the announcement was made without any prior warning or lead-up. The uproar was also due to Ross O'Donovan and Avidan announcing their Game Grumps spin-off Steam Train the same day that Jafari's departure was disclosed.[23]

Collaborations[edit]
Jafari has collaborated with multiple YouTube channels, including Ethan and Hila Klein's channel h3h3 Productions. As of October 2015, Hila Klein is a producer for JonTron.[24] He has made an appearance on James Rolfe's Let's Play series James &amp; Mike Mondays.[25] Jafari was also a featured vocalist in an episode of The Gregory Brothers' viral webseries Songify the News.[26] At the same time, The Gregory Brothers remixed Jafari's review of the bootlegged game, Titenic, and it was released on iTunes.[27][28]

Jafari has done voice-over work for the video game-based blog Did You Know Gaming?, covering episodes on The Legend of Zelda, Donkey Kong, Pokémon, Pikmin, Animal Crossing, Dragon Quest, Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric, and games of Disney franchises. He has also covered the development of Star Wars for their spin-off series Did You Know Movies? on fellow YouTube personality Matthew Patrick's channel, The Film Theorists.[29][30]

In 2013, before his departure from Game Grumps, Jafari and Hanson appeared in a promotional video produced by Polaris for the Warner Bros. movie Pacific Rim. The video featured fellow internet personalities Jesse Cox, Dodger, HuskyStarcraft and TotalBiscuit.[31] In the video they played new recruits undergoing training by ""The Lieutenant Commander"" played by Robert Kazinsky. Around the same time, Jafari appeared in Ninja Sex Party's music video for ""Let's Get This Terrible Party Started,"" which was directed by Hanson.[23]

To promote the 2013 World Series, Jafari appeared in an a capella cover of ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game,"" produced by PepsiCo and musician Mike Tompkins, and uploaded to Maker Studios' Maker Music channel.[32][33]

Other work[edit]
Jafari played Banjo-Kazooie in June 2014 on a Twitch stream to collect donations for Teach For America's GoFundMe campaign. Jafari stated that if the $25,000 proposed goal was hit, he would reprise his cover of Katy Perry's song ""Firework,"" which was originally recorded in 2011 in his review of DinoCity. The full version of the cover was uploaded to Jafari's YouTube channel on February 14, 2016.[34]

Jafari has provided voice-over work for A Hat in Time, an upcoming video game by Gears for Breakfast,[35] and will be providing his voice for a character in Playtonic Games' upcoming 3D platforming video game Yooka-Laylee.[36][37]

Popularity[edit]
Jafari was referenced in the 2011 indie game DLC Quest on a gravestone, along with the Game Grumps hosts' catchphrase, ""real talk."" The gravestone also read ""???-2013,"" referencing Jafari's departure from the show in 2013.[38]

In 2016, Jafari was featured as a character in the dating sim and visual novel Asagao Academy.[39] Funded as a Kickstarter project in 2014, it also starred portrayals of other NormalBoots creators, including Austin Hargrave from PeanutButterGamer, Nick Murphy, Paul Ritchey, and Josh Henderson from Continue?, Shane Gill from Did You Know Gaming?, Satchell Drakes from Satchbag’s Goods, Jared Knabenbauer from ProJared, and Jirard Khalil from The Completionist.[40]

Awards and honors[edit]
In 2013, Jafari was among CraveOnline's ""7 Awesome YouTube Gamers You Should Watch."" Writer Paul Tamburro stated, ""Mixing a large dollop of offbeat humour with a light sprinkle of insightful commentary, JonTron's reviews of games of old have inspired many imitators, but none have proven to be more hilarious.""[41] Time magazine listed JonTron as 2015's seventh most searched Internet meme on Google, and he was also ranked number five on WatchMojo.com's ""Top 10 YouTube Video Game Reviewers.""[42][43]",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,t3_4pxme0,,,,,,,,,,,1466979822.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1469313988.0,,,

&gt; Cass McCombs (born in Concord, California in 1977) is an American singer-songwriter and performer.

&gt; An enigmatic folk nomad, McCombs is a quintessentially American artist; ""he's quietly become one of (the country's) finest chroniclers of fringe characters, a writer of heart-rending love songs and psychedelic odes to the natural world, a teller of tall-tales with a sense of humor dry as desert wood, and that rare folksinger who actually sings about the folk."" His vocals range somewhere between the anxious drone of Lou Reed, the hollow croon of Elliott Smith, the lilting melody of Morrissey, and the driving earnestness and complexity of bards such as Leonard Cohen or Bob Dylan. His lyrical style is alternately vivid and weary, laconic and yearning, or drifting into the high-spirited and whimsical.

&gt; After cutting his first EP, Not the Way in San Francisco in 2001, McCombs relocated to Baltimore, MD. There he released ""Not the Way"" in 2002 and recorded his first full-length, A, in 2003 on Monitor Records. He spent the next few years touring: playing All Tomorrow's Parties; and opening for bands such as Modest Mouse, The Decemberists, and Belle and Sebastian; before recording his second LP PREfection, which was released on 4AD in 2005. 

&gt; McCombs' subsequent releases have been on the highly successful British independent label Domino Recording Co. 2007's Dropping the Writ was named one of Amazon's Best Albums of that year. Catacombs was voted one of the 50 greatest albums of 2009 by Pitchfork Media, and features Academy Award-nominated actress and singer Karen Black on the track Dreams-Come-True-Girl. During this period, McCombs toured with the likes of Arcade Fire, Andrew Bird, Band of Horses, José González, Beach House, and The Walkmen.

&gt; Catacombs also established McCombs' relationship with engineer/producer Ariel Rechtshaid, member of The Hippos and Foreign Born, who produced Grammy-winning hit Climax for Usher, the Plain White T's Grammy-nominated No.1 platinum-selling single Hey There Delilah, and albums for Vampire Weekend, Sky Ferreira, Snoop Lion, and Haim, among others.

&gt; In 2010 McCombs played Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago, L.A.'s Culture Collide Festival and Invisible Children Benefit. 2011 offered an extensive headlining tour, an appearance at SXSW, and two albums released by McCombs and produced by Rechtshaid: Wit's End in April and Humor Risk in November. The two albums were made simultaneously. In an interview with Pitchfork, McCombs explains: ""Wit's End was started years ago and it slowly made its way to the finish line. Humor Risk was just punched out. They're friends but they're different. Wit's End is like a stew; Humor Risk is the raw food diet.""

&gt; Big Wheel and Others, McCombs' seventh full-length (and first double album) was released in October 2013. The album is rooted in the Americana mythos of the Wild West, from the San Francisco drug culture to the gunslingers and gold rush of the nineteenth century. The album once again features Karen Black on a version of the track Brighter!, her final recording before passing away due to ampullary cancer in August, 2013. Big Wheel is dedicated to her memory.

t5_2rig0,,,,False,,,1.0,,,,FL_Studio,,,,,,d49o3xr,,,0,,,,GabrielHawk,,,t1_d49mgrr,1,,,,,,"Well the difference between my worst and best stuff is definitely not the mastering.  I think most people would attest to that.  I don't have experience recording other bands, but I've learned a lot from a few studios in my city.  These days, studios are having a hard time keeping their doors open, so a lot of them are willing to take money to teach you one on one.  It's a lot more hands on then an academy dedicated to engineering might teach you.  They both have their merits.  

And I don't necessarily mean you should be spending a lot of money on a mastering engineer.  I'm just saying the most expensive mastering process is more related to finalizing an entire album, and it becomes a little more redundant when done to a single song that you're uploading to soundcloud.  So yes, mastering is a respected process that can't be substituted with a preset, but no, it's not as essential as the earlier steps of recording.  If you're really bummed that your tracks aren't as loud as you want, that's another conversation.  

This was close to two years ago.  I really hate the mix.  It's not really hip-hop or anything, I was trying to make something weird.  I still like the ideas, just not the execution.  https://soundcloud.com/gabe-hawk/everythings-ok-mastered

Kinda the same story here.  https://soundcloud.com/gabe-hawk/cancer

Now the difference between that earlier work and this stuff is better monitors than I originally had, better contrast and space for the kick, and just making more music really.  It will all come in time.  https://soundcloud.com/gabe-hawk/carpet-romance

I remade the Goin' down for real beat.  I still think it's pretty damn close.  https://soundcloud.com/gabe-hawk/goin-down-for-real-1/s-WQIXn

This would be more indie.  I'm not a great singer, and this is clearly an unfinished version of this song, but it's one of the most recent things I've done.  I was going for a really smashed and indie feeling.  More textural than hard hitting hip-hop beats might be.  https://soundcloud.com/gabe-hawk/want-me-dead/s-hoduL

I'll also dm you an in progress song for a local guy.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,t3_4mwki8,,,,,,,,,,,1465957479.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1469047608.0,,,

&gt; Cass McCombs (born in Concord, California in 1977) is an American singer-songwriter and performer.

&gt; An enigmatic folk nomad, McCombs is a quintessentially American artist; ""he's quietly become one of (the country's) finest chroniclers of fringe characters, a writer of heart-rending love songs and psychedelic odes to the natural world, a teller of tall-tales with a sense of humor dry as desert wood, and that rare folksinger who actually sings about the folk."" His vocals range somewhere between the anxious drone of Lou Reed, the hollow croon of Elliott Smith, the lilting melody of Morrissey, and the driving earnestness and complexity of bards such as Leonard Cohen or Bob Dylan. His lyrical style is alternately vivid and weary, laconic and yearning, or drifting into the high-spirited and whimsical.

&gt; After cutting his first EP, Not the Way in San Francisco in 2001, McCombs relocated to Baltimore, MD. There he released ""Not the Way"" in 2002 and recorded his first full-length, A, in 2003 on Monitor Records. He spent the next few years touring: playing All Tomorrow's Parties; and opening for bands such as Modest Mouse, The Decemberists, and Belle and Sebastian; before recording his second LP PREfection, which was released on 4AD in 2005. 

&gt; McCombs' subsequent releases have been on the highly successful British independent label Domino Recording Co. 2007's Dropping the Writ was named one of Amazon's Best Albums of that year. Catacombs was voted one of the 50 greatest albums of 2009 by Pitchfork Media, and features Academy Award-nominated actress and singer Karen Black on the track Dreams-Come-True-Girl. During this period, McCombs toured with the likes of Arcade Fire, Andrew Bird, Band of Horses, José González, Beach House, and The Walkmen.

&gt; Catacombs also established McCombs' relationship with engineer/producer Ariel Rechtshaid, member of The Hippos and Foreign Born, who produced Grammy-winning hit Climax for Usher, the Plain White T's Grammy-nominated No.1 platinum-selling single Hey There Delilah, and albums for Vampire Weekend, Sky Ferreira, Snoop Lion, and Haim, among others.

&gt; In 2010 McCombs played Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago, L.A.'s Culture Collide Festival and Invisible Children Benefit. 2011 offered an extensive headlining tour, an appearance at SXSW, and two albums released by McCombs and produced by Rechtshaid: Wit's End in April and Humor Risk in November. The two albums were made simultaneously. In an interview with Pitchfork, McCombs explains: ""Wit's End was started years ago and it slowly made its way to the finish line. Humor Risk was just punched out. They're friends but they're different. Wit's End is like a stew; Humor Risk is the raw food diet.""

&gt; Big Wheel and Others, McCombs' seventh full-length (and first double album) was released in October 2013. The album is rooted in the Americana mythos of the Wild West, from the San Francisco drug culture to the gunslingers and gold rush of the nineteenth century. The album once again features Karen Black on a version of the track Brighter!, her final recording before passing away due to ampullary cancer in August, 2013. Big Wheel is dedicated to her memory.

 [artist pic](http://img2-ak.lst.fm/i/u/252/bcc2e16fd5fb45de9cac89c62440f666.png)  

&gt; British-born Carina Round is a singer-songwriter whom has earned tremendous accolades from fans, critics and the artistic community alike for both her distinctive, yet versatile vocal style and gut wrenchingly honest songwriting.

&gt; Her critically acclaimed performances are nothing short of spectacular. She runs the gamut from “howling siren” to the performer of ethereal confessional tales, disbanding all concepts of musical tags. It is no wonder she has shared stages with an array of diverse artists such as Annie Lennox, Billy Corgan, Maynard James Keenan, Ryan Adams, Elbow, The Gutter Twins, Snow Patrol, Miles Hunt (The Wonder Stuff), Mark Eitzel, and the legendary James Brown. 

&gt; Growing up in Wolverhampton, England, Carina, starting from a very young age, always had an affinity towards music and began to follow her musical dreams. Never losing sight of her goals, her determination and passion led to the recording of her first album The First Blood Mystery (2001). Shaped in the erratic but gripping sounds, her love of legends Patti Smith and Jeff Buckley resonates undeniably. 

&gt; The follow-up and Interscope re-released debut album: The Disconnection (2004) took those influences into much more powerful and personal realms. It landed Carina worldwide exposure in the process, which ultimately brought her career to Los Angeles, California. The relocation proved worthwhile. For Slow Motion Addict (2007), Carina teamed up with notable producer Glen Ballard to create a bewitching and seductive new album. Accompanying the release was a 12-part episodic series that cleverly coincided with each track, creating a visual story for the album. It gave Carina another medium to showcase her artistic ability by acting and starring as the troubled lead character, Maisie Scarlett. 

&gt; Two years later, Carina self-released the EP Things You Should Know in 2009 that resulted in more critical success, having multiple film &amp; TV shows feature her music as well as multiple radio stations, including KCRW, champion her music. Opportunities came flooding in to work with other artists Carina has admired over the years. She began working and touring with Tool’s Maynard James Keenan on his band Puscifer and sang vocals on The Twilight Singers new album ‘Dynamite Steps’ along with other artists Nick McCabe (The Verve), Mark Lanegan, and Ani DiFranco, among others. In addition to this, Carina moved into the world of composing and writing for film, working with the award winning film composers John Debney and Glen Ballard on a song that was composed for the film Valentine’s Day, writing with Academy Award winner Marco Beltrami, as well as various others. 

&gt; In one of Carina’s co-writing sessions for film &amp; TV, a band was created called Early Winters with EMI Canadian artist Justin Rutledge, L.A. producer/musician Dan Burns and multi-instrumentalist Zac Rae. The band is an indie rock band with touches of country and folk flare, which draw comparisons to Neko Case and the Swell Season. 

&gt; All of these projects were an inspirational stepping stone for Carina to completing her newest album Tigermending which was released May 1st 2012 through her label Dehisce. On the new track ‘Got To Go (The L.A Song) features Smashing Pumpkins’ front man Billy Corgan playing guitar and she co-wrote the haunting track ‘The Secret of Drowning’ with the legendary Dave Stewart and Brian Eno.

&gt; Comparisons are frequently drawn to PJ Harvey, though Round would contend that she is more directly influenced by Patti Smith.

I didn't know many engineers, so I don't know what the faculty is like, and I graduated in 2008, but here goes:

Avoid the Bop at Owens Park. It's shit. In fact, avoid most clubs in Fallowfield, it's the student ghetto and it tends to be hellish on Fridays. It did have a couple of nice bars when I first came here, but they're closed.

5th Avenue, the indie club on Princess Street, is fun in 1st year, everyone goes there at some point, but in 2nd year, you will wonder what you ever saw in it. Drinks are cheap as fuck though.

The Northern Quarter is full of hipsters but has some nice gig venues and restaurants / cafes. Afflecks Palace is boss, though expensive. The Retro Bar, the Salisbury and the Old House at Home (my local) are my favourite pubs. My favourite club was Jilly's Rockworld but alas, it is now a Tesco.

You will probably meet the Crazy Bus Lady at some point. Don't worry, she's harmless. She will probably try to give you some of her leaflets.

The Curry Mile is a mixed bag but has a lot of great curry places that are open till stupid o'clock in the morning. They're quite student friendly as well.

As for what I liked, I'd moved from Chester to Manchester, and as I spent my childhood in Brighton, Manchester was more like what I was used to - it's like Brighton without the sea, and less expensive to live in. Public transport is a million times better than it is in Chester, buses are very frequent and there's also the Metrolink. I've got family here and I made some of my best friends at university. Went to loads of gigs as well - at one point I lived about 5-10 minutes' walk away from the Academy. It is a great place to be if you're a music fan and most of the best gigs of my life have been here. As for Man United, while tickets are expensive (I don't know if you can get them through the students' union, I think you could for City), Old Trafford is doable on public transport.

&gt; This youthful band is a purveyor of a panoramic yet nuanced sound, flowing from intimate to anthemic, the mood from vibrant to contemplative, with frontman Cameron Neal’s lyrics ranging from confessional to metaphorical. The result evokes the wide-open spaces of America’s Midwest but infuses the sense of grit and wonderment with edgier emotions.
Horse Thief originally founded in Denton, TX, moved to Oklahoma City to attend the Academy of Contemporary Music at the University of Central Oklahoma, from which they recently graduated. The band subsequently signed with the Flaming Lips’ management and soon came to the attention of Bella Union. Though Fear In Bliss was conceived at Horse Thief’s Oklahoma headquarters the band decided to record the album in LA, “to leave our comfort zone of Oklahoma”, and producer Thom Monahan (Devendra Banhart, Vetiver) has helped the band fuse their renowned stage performance with studio quality.

&gt; The over-arching theme to Fear In Bliss is “finding yourself and what you believe in, and finding the comfort in acknowledging fear. I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression which comes out a lot on the new album. But when everything gets rough, I think there’s always a way to fix it. The biggest thing for me is to give comfort to people, to shed light on the truth that someone is feeling the same way as them.”

 [artist pic](http://img2-ak.lst.fm/i/u/252/9fd03c7702df473c93df5ae4954479fc.png)  

&gt; The first thing you realise when listening to Fossil Collective is that this is a band that do things differently. Beautiful melodic music, with rich glorious harmonies and meticulous attention to detail, it is as much an aural statement as it is a pleasure to listen to. Layer upon layer of harmony mixed with delicate uplifting sounds may well remind you of other artists, be it Neil Young, Simon &amp; Garfunkel or Midlake but this music is no mere imitation. Whilst Fossil Collective's songs tip their cap to these classic musicians, scratch the surface and you discover something more contemporary, yet equally as rewarding.

&gt; It seems impossible that something so sonically complete could appear as if from nowhere, but Fossil Collective, the Yorkshire two-piece have been perfecting their craft and working towards this moment for years. Consisting of multi-instrumentalists David Fendick and Jonny Hooker, both were local musicians from the Leeds music scene, whose paths had crossed at various points in different bands. 'What separated Jonny from the other people I'd met was his total commitment to music' begins Dave. 'Whereas other people we were around were in bands for somewhat clichéd reasons, our focus was the music and the songs and for that reason we gravitated towards each other'. After a successful album with Leeds band Vib Gyor, the duo decided to strip everything back and start again.

&gt; Jonny reminisces, ""we felt we had to fold our cards and be honest to ourselves. We were listening to the kind of music we grew up with. (Neil Young, Fleetwood Mac, The Beach Boys, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, James Taylor) We decided there and then to try and capture the essence of that traditional songcraft, to strip everything back to the song, lyrics and melody'' Dave steps in ""It was actually very liberating to be able to do that"".

&gt; Armed with 3 roughly prepared demos, the duo found themselves looking for a recording studio. 'We had no money at all, but our friends had a modest little studio in a crypt just outside of the city' says Dave. 'It was a totally surreal place to go to as it was in the middle of nowhere. We had to stop recording at various points during the day as the main church was directly above the crypt. Whenever there was a mass or a wedding for example we had to be quiet - like little church mice scurrying about downstairs.’ However, a week of intense recording paid off, and they re-surfaced with 3 songs that would become their self released 'Honey Slides' EP. 

&gt; Jonny explains. 'Before we had even decided on the name Fossil Collective we realised that we wanted this project to be a continual running order of like-minded local artists. We worked on the principle that if we surrounded ourselves with an evolving stream of people we admired then our music would never become stale. Keeping away from the constraints of a 'typical' band dynamic would keep it open and interesting for us. If we wanted a harpist we'd go and find one, If we wanted a cellist we'd go and find one and so on.'

&gt; Knowing they were on to something special they wanted something visual to reflect this. Enlisting the help of Leeds animator Ashley Dean (Broken Pixel) was the next logical step. ‘Ash is a good friend and a like-minded independent local artist. We played him On &amp; On and asked him to interpret the song.’ The result was the stop/start animated video of a courtship between a wolf and a stag that went viral on youtube, getting over 250,000 hits in 2 weeks. 

&gt; Once they put their heads above water, things started happening very quickly. Their 3rd gig was at Shepherds Bush Empire, supporting Benjamin Francis Leftwich. ""It was great because other artists were contacting us, saying how much they liked our music and inviting us to tour"" remembers Jonny. ""It was sudden, but we were lucky to have great network of friends to come play with us and help interpret the songs live … after all, who is going to turn down the chance to play Shepherds bush Empire!"" The band did a full tour with Ben and then another UK support with soul singer Ren Harvieu.

&gt; On 11th June 2012 Fossil Collectives Debut EP 'Let It Go' was released. Lead track was 'Single of the Week' on iTunes USA, opening the doors to a lot of new fans. It received plays and support from Mark Riley, Radcliffe and Maconie, Chris Hawkins and Steve Lamacq at 6 Music. It also won the 6 music rebel playlist. Radio 2 support came from Bob Harris, Mark Radcliffe and an extremely supportive Dermot O'Leary who invited them in for a chat and to perform on his Saturday Radio2 show.  'Let it Go' also made the XFM playlist, the Q playlist &amp; the NME 'A' list. A 10 date headline tour coincided with this, selling out in Manchester &amp; London in a matter of days.

&gt; The band built on this success by releasing the 'On &amp; On' EP on 22nd October. Receiving the same support from radio, they were also invited in to record an infamous Daytrotter Session. Press support came from Sunday Times, Time Out, The Fly, The Independent &amp; NME. It was at this point that The Civil Wars starting tweeting about how much they were enjoying the music. A few friendly emails later and Fossil Collective were supporting them at the key gigs of their UK tour. (Camden Roundhouse, Manchester Apollo, Glasgow 02 Academy) 'We feel privileged to play anywhere though' says Dave - be it our last sell out London show to a couple of hundred people, or a few thousand people at Camden Roundhouse. What is important is that we always stay true to ourselves and the music.'

&gt; After a winter spent locked away in the studio, Fossil Collective came out of hibernation with “Tell Where I Lie” in hand – their beautifully crafted, ten track, debut album. The album hit record stores on April 8th 2013, the same day the band were invited into Bob Harris’ Radio 2 studio to record a two track session. Released to rapturous acclaim from both fans and critics alike; “Tell Where I Lie” was named iTunes’ ‘editors choice’, quickly climbed to number 1 in the US ‘New Artist Billboard Chart and graced the pages of Clash, Q Magazine, NME, Drowned In Sound and Hunger. 

&gt; With  extensive UK and US tours scheduled for the rest of the year, it’s looking to be a very productive 2013 for the band. ""We look back to just over a year ago"" says Dave ""When it was just the two of us sitting in Jonny's house with a couple of acoustic guitars working on those first ideas - it's incredible how much we have achieved in such a short amount of time""

&gt; At least one thing is certain - in another 12 months, many, many more people will have fallen for the intense song writing of Fossil Collective. Music like this cannot be kept a secret for long.

t5_2rrmq,,,,1459201162,,,10.0,,,,FortCollins,,,,,,d1gjeye,,,0,,,,celian123,,,t3_4c6je3,10,,,,,,"Man, this thread actually made me pretty angry. Fort Collins is definitely a cool place, and if you like the feel of a ""city"" vs a small community, you would definitely prefer Fort Collins. It feels larger than it really is because it is the ""go-to"" city for the Northern Colorado area.

That being said, I've lived in Foco, Greeley and the surrounding countryside my entire life (35 years) and the reputation and comments here towards Greeley are pretty unjustified, and strike me as knee-jerk social bias. I've lived in both, and they each have their pros and cons. We plan on selling our place in south east Fort Collins and moving back to Greeley because it suites us better.

Why do we like the town?

1.) It feels more like a small town, despite having 100,000 people. More laid back, friendly and calm. This isn't important to all, but to me it's a huge part of my quality of life.

2.) You aren't as close to the mountains, but the views on the west side of town are fabulous. Our house (currently a rental) gets to see magnificent sunsets every night. Being a little farther away afford this great view. It's also pretty nice driving just a few minutes east and being surrounded by nothing but plains.

3.) The cost of living is much lower. I realize houses in Greeley are filling up, and there's definitely a lot of overflow from people who used to be from Foco and Loveland who can't afford the real estate prices anymore, but it's still between $50 and $100,000 less for a comparable house in a comparable quality neighborhood. On top of that add higher sales tax, property tax, and in general more expensive retail and it can be a big deal. Given how close Loveland, Foco and the mountains are, I'd rather save all that money. Realistically, how many days per week are you going to the mountains? 1, maybe 2? And you'll be driving a car anyway, so it's just a longer trip. 

4.) Traffic. Driving in Foco is a hassle. It can take me 20-25 minutes to get from SE Fort Collins to Old Town. I can make the same drive from Greeley in about 35-40. That's not a substantial time savings when you factor in costs.

5.) Some of the Greeley city facilities are as good and in some cases better than things found in Foco/Loveland. The Ice Haus, Funplex, Island Grove and Union Colony Civic Center are all pretty great. I'm sure there's more that I'm leaving out.

6.) Downtown is definitely smaller, but it's getting pretty nice now. The Kress is a great indie movie theater, there's a ton of new restaurants and shops and even a pretty great music venue and club. It's not like Old Town, but it's not garbage either.

7.) There are some pretty great festivals like the Greeley Stampede, the Blues Festival, Jazz festival, Arts Picnic, Oktoberfest, etc.

8.) The Bike Trails are pretty good on the west side of town. Between the Sheep Draw Trail, Poudre Trail and the 12 foot sidewalks meant to be used as bike routes, you can get most places safely. Also, and this is a matter of opinion, I don't think Foco or Loveland have a trail as nice as the poudre trail between Greeley &amp; Timnath. It's just perfect in that you are hardly ever in town. I know many will disagree with this point, but if you like trail biking there is a good option.

9.) The smell is not an issue, and I really think people perpetuating this never spent time in the city. It's hardly there but once a month, and when it is, it's a subdued smell. This whole area has agricultural roots so if you are very put off by the subtle smell of cow poop once every few weeks, this area in general might not be a good fit.

There's a lot more, but I am out of time to type.

In my eyes there are two, and only two, reasons to avoid Greeley if you work there.

The first would be if you are not comfortable living next to Oil &amp; Gas development. There are fracking pads setup throughout the city and around it. Generally they are hidden well, and landscaped so as to not be an eyesore, but if you do believe that there is a risk of either air or water pollution from being around them, steer clear. This is the original reason we moved out, but I think my fears were overblown.

The second would be if you have a concern about schools. Greeley does have the worse school system unless you get them in a school like Frontier Academy. or other charter school. Supposedly the new super-intendent for district 6 is making some great changes, but even if that's the case it would be years before you see results from them.

They are both good cities, but I think it would be absolute insanity to subject yourself to a 45 minute commute over a bunch of stereotypes that aren't even true. That's 90 minutes a day in a car....",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,t3_4c6je3,,,,,,,,,,,1459185335.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1460933455.0,,,

&gt;  Description book **No One Belongs Here More Than You by Miranda July**:

&gt;  For me, this book was two stories away from being downright terrible. One story, ""Mon Plaisir,"" I thought was excellent. Another I found myself enjoying quite a bit. Others contained passages that made me grimace. Physically. Like, I wanted to turn my head away. Instead, I just dog-eared the pages that contained the shitty passages: ""My knees buckled, I went down to the floor. I cried in English, I cried in French, I cried in all the languages, because tears are the same all around the world. Esperanto."" and this:""This pain, this dying, this is just normal. This is how life is.""I felt that the author was trying so very, very hard to make uniquely insightful statements that would make readers sit back and say, ""Wow, genius!"" It was all such an effort, and reading the book quickly became a laborious task because I was annoyed at the tone and at the lack of enthralling…well, anything. First off, a story doesn't HAVE to be about a just-out-of-school lesbian hooker to be interesting. A story also doesn't have to contain lurid **oooh, shocking!** sexual detail to be interesting and meaningful. One story was actually called ""This Person"" and is about as interesting as the title itself. It's not the lack of a linear narrative or even the annoying, strained characters that I find most irritating about this book. I just think the writing more often than not is lazy and shitty; I think there's no real effort to paint imagery for the reader or to SHOW the reader anything with language. Everything is TOLD, lecture-style, rather than shown. Mainly I just don't want trite quips forced down my throat. I just want to read good writing.Overall? Trite. Banal. Hackneyed. Blech.

 [artist pic](http://img2-ak.lst.fm/i/u/252/9fd03c7702df473c93df5ae4954479fc.png)  

&gt; The first thing you realise when listening to Fossil Collective is that this is a band that do things differently. Beautiful melodic music, with rich glorious harmonies and meticulous attention to detail, it is as much an aural statement as it is a pleasure to listen to. Layer upon layer of harmony mixed with delicate uplifting sounds may well remind you of other artists, be it Neil Young, Simon &amp; Garfunkel or Midlake but this music is no mere imitation. Whilst Fossil Collective's songs tip their cap to these classic musicians, scratch the surface and you discover something more contemporary, yet equally as rewarding.

&gt; It seems impossible that something so sonically complete could appear as if from nowhere, but Fossil Collective, the Yorkshire two-piece have been perfecting their craft and working towards this moment for years. Consisting of multi-instrumentalists David Fendick and Jonny Hooker, both were local musicians from the Leeds music scene, whose paths had crossed at various points in different bands. 'What separated Jonny from the other people I'd met was his total commitment to music' begins Dave. 'Whereas other people we were around were in bands for somewhat clichéd reasons, our focus was the music and the songs and for that reason we gravitated towards each other'. After a successful album with Leeds band Vib Gyor, the duo decided to strip everything back and start again.

&gt; Jonny reminisces, ""we felt we had to fold our cards and be honest to ourselves. We were listening to the kind of music we grew up with. (Neil Young, Fleetwood Mac, The Beach Boys, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, James Taylor) We decided there and then to try and capture the essence of that traditional songcraft, to strip everything back to the song, lyrics and melody'' Dave steps in ""It was actually very liberating to be able to do that"".

&gt; Armed with 3 roughly prepared demos, the duo found themselves looking for a recording studio. 'We had no money at all, but our friends had a modest little studio in a crypt just outside of the city' says Dave. 'It was a totally surreal place to go to as it was in the middle of nowhere. We had to stop recording at various points during the day as the main church was directly above the crypt. Whenever there was a mass or a wedding for example we had to be quiet - like little church mice scurrying about downstairs.’ However, a week of intense recording paid off, and they re-surfaced with 3 songs that would become their self released 'Honey Slides' EP. 

&gt; Jonny explains. 'Before we had even decided on the name Fossil Collective we realised that we wanted this project to be a continual running order of like-minded local artists. We worked on the principle that if we surrounded ourselves with an evolving stream of people we admired then our music would never become stale. Keeping away from the constraints of a 'typical' band dynamic would keep it open and interesting for us. If we wanted a harpist we'd go and find one, If we wanted a cellist we'd go and find one and so on.'

&gt; Knowing they were on to something special they wanted something visual to reflect this. Enlisting the help of Leeds animator Ashley Dean (Broken Pixel) was the next logical step. ‘Ash is a good friend and a like-minded independent local artist. We played him On &amp; On and asked him to interpret the song.’ The result was the stop/start animated video of a courtship between a wolf and a stag that went viral on youtube, getting over 250,000 hits in 2 weeks. 

&gt; Once they put their heads above water, things started happening very quickly. Their 3rd gig was at Shepherds Bush Empire, supporting Benjamin Francis Leftwich. ""It was great because other artists were contacting us, saying how much they liked our music and inviting us to tour"" remembers Jonny. ""It was sudden, but we were lucky to have great network of friends to come play with us and help interpret the songs live … after all, who is going to turn down the chance to play Shepherds bush Empire!"" The band did a full tour with Ben and then another UK support with soul singer Ren Harvieu.

&gt; On 11th June 2012 Fossil Collectives Debut EP 'Let It Go' was released. Lead track was 'Single of the Week' on iTunes USA, opening the doors to a lot of new fans. It received plays and support from Mark Riley, Radcliffe and Maconie, Chris Hawkins and Steve Lamacq at 6 Music. It also won the 6 music rebel playlist. Radio 2 support came from Bob Harris, Mark Radcliffe and an extremely supportive Dermot O'Leary who invited them in for a chat and to perform on his Saturday Radio2 show.  'Let it Go' also made the XFM playlist, the Q playlist &amp; the NME 'A' list. A 10 date headline tour coincided with this, selling out in Manchester &amp; London in a matter of days.

&gt; The band built on this success by releasing the 'On &amp; On' EP on 22nd October. Receiving the same support from radio, they were also invited in to record an infamous Daytrotter Session. Press support came from Sunday Times, Time Out, The Fly, The Independent &amp; NME. It was at this point that The Civil Wars starting tweeting about how much they were enjoying the music. A few friendly emails later and Fossil Collective were supporting them at the key gigs of their UK tour. (Camden Roundhouse, Manchester Apollo, Glasgow 02 Academy) 'We feel privileged to play anywhere though' says Dave - be it our last sell out London show to a couple of hundred people, or a few thousand people at Camden Roundhouse. What is important is that we always stay true to ourselves and the music.'

&gt; After a winter spent locked away in the studio, Fossil Collective came out of hibernation with “Tell Where I Lie” in hand – their beautifully crafted, ten track, debut album. The album hit record stores on April 8th 2013, the same day the band were invited into Bob Harris’ Radio 2 studio to record a two track session. Released to rapturous acclaim from both fans and critics alike; “Tell Where I Lie” was named iTunes’ ‘editors choice’, quickly climbed to number 1 in the US ‘New Artist Billboard Chart and graced the pages of Clash, Q Magazine, NME, Drowned In Sound and Hunger. 

&gt; With  extensive UK and US tours scheduled for the rest of the year, it’s looking to be a very productive 2013 for the band. ""We look back to just over a year ago"" says Dave ""When it was just the two of us sitting in Jonny's house with a couple of acoustic guitars working on those first ideas - it's incredible how much we have achieved in such a short amount of time""

&gt; At least one thing is certain - in another 12 months, many, many more people will have fallen for the intense song writing of Fossil Collective. Music like this cannot be kept a secret for long.

&gt; Songwriter Oren Lavie (Tel Aviv, Israel), who has drawn comparisons in the press to Nick Drake, the Beatles and Crosby Stills &amp; Nash, released his debut album “The Opposite Side Of The Sea” on March 10th, 2009 on his own imprint, A Quarter Past Wonderful, which he started with tastemaker and current KCRW host Chris Douridas.  Says Douridas, a 27-year veteran of radio, “I've never been so motivated to help an artist get his music out into the world until I met Oren. He is incredibly special. It's rare every song in an artist's catalogue moves me like Oren’s do.""

&gt; The album is as eclectic as Oren’s home bases of Tel Aviv, Israel (where he was born), Berlin Germany (where he recorded the album), and Los Angeles, CA (the home of his new label). It was released in Europe and immediately garnered great press with Uncut raving in a four-star review that the album is “cinematic and mellow, like Nick Drake in a cheerful summer bonnet…”

&gt; Many people in the US will be familiar with Oren’s music as his album track ‘Her Morning Elegance’ was featured in a national ad campaign for Chevy Malibu. He also wrote the end credit “A Dance ‘Round the Memory Tree” for the film The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian joining Regina Spektor and Hanne Hukkelberg on the soundtrack.

&gt; Born in Tel-Aviv, Israel, Oren began his creative journey as a playwright. At the age of 21 he wrote and directed a play for the Israeli Fringe Theater Festival, which won the awards for best newcomer writer and director. He later moved to London on a scholarship to attend the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts. While still at school he wrote a play he later directed in an Off West-end theater to critical acclaim. The production was named by Time-Out London as one of the best 5 shows in London during its run. Oren moved to NY where he gradually began to shift his focus from playwriting to a shorter form of storytelling, the song. Two years later he relocated to Berlin and began work on The Opposite Side of The Sea.

&gt; In 2007 the album was released in Europe, then found its way to the KCRW playlist in LA. Shortly after that the album track ‘Her Morning Elegance’ was synched to a Chevrolet Malibu TV campaign. Oren, who does not own a television and has not driven a car for 10 years, continues to ride the bus. With the earnings from the TV ad he started his own label in the US, named it, then renamed it, changed it again and finally decided to call it Quarter Past Wonderful. He then released The Opposite Side Of The Sea on iTunes US, where it climbed to #30 on the charts.

&gt; Oren Lavie's music doesn't come right at you through the front door; its elliptical nature is mysterious and dense and remains slightly unresolved. His vignettes of life are heartbreaking. One can hear his playwright past in his narratives as his songs unfold like a collection of short stories in musical poetic form.

&gt; Glasgow’s C Duncan, born 1989, is the son of two classical musicians. Surrounded by music throughout his childhood, Christopher initially took up piano and viola. His teens led him to school bands – learning to play guitar, bass and drums – but did little to quell his fascination with the composition and performance of classical music. He eventually enrolled in Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland) to study music composition, where his pieces were performed by various ensembles across the UK.

&gt; To hear C Duncan’s music now is to grasp those two common threads between his interests in classical and modern music. The pieces that make up his forthcoming debut LP are formed from lush choral harmonies and acoustic instrumentation, textured like contemporary dreampop and all recorded at home in Glasgow on his bedroom studio setup, gradually built up one layer and one instrument at a time. The results of this methodical and isolationist recording process give us charming lo-fi folk with the harmonic width of choral composition, the sweetness of barbershop and the rough eloquence that has so readily soundtracked Glasgow over the past decades.

&gt; Christopher is also an accomplished painter, naming Grant Wood and Gerhard Richter as influences. His work has been exhibited throughout Scotland and he provides cover art for his own records, expressing the same musical ideas through painted image. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Gareth Coker is a British composer based in Los Angeles, currently working across in gaming / interactive media, films, and commercials. He is working on the independent video games Primal Carnage by Lukewarm Media, and The Spire by Raw Games, both of which have been featured prominently in the gaming press. He continues to work on short independent films, and his work has been licensed for numerous theatrical trailers internationally, including “The King’s Speech”, “Reign Of Assassins”, and “The Secret In Their Eyes.”

&gt; Gareth was educated at the University of Southern California on the Scoring for Motion Pictures and Television program, where he was able to learn a plethora of music techniques and collaborate with the filmmakers located in the nearby School of Cinematic Arts and School of Interactive Media. The result of these collaborations are films which have gone on to be screened at numerous festivals, such as Ellen and What To Bring To America. Gareth received his undergraduate degree in composition from the Royal Academy of Music in London.

&gt; Gareth is also a remix artist, having done remixes of tracks by Damage Vault, Madeleine Bloom, both of which were featured tracks on remix compilations released by the FIXT record label. Gareth has been a BMI-affiliated songwriter since 2006.

&gt; In addition to the obvious interest in music, Gareth is a keen traveler and whilst visiting many countries, has also lived for extended periods of time in Japan, the east coast of America (Baltimore) and the Netherlands. He draws on this multicultural history for his music compositions. Read more on Last.fm.

The engineering school is at Fulton Center and near Clinton Hill/Boerum Hill. I used to live next to the campus and it's a really nice area. I can name at least 10 good restaurants in the immediate vicinity of campus. There was a park right on campus that would host summer music festivals, outdoor film screenings, sporting event screenings, etc. You're right next to movie theaters, an outdoor mall, and The Brooklyn Academy of Music (a cultural institution that hosts good indie movies, avant-garde theatre, and cultural festivals.)

When I hear people complaining about their campus in NYC, I want to scream at them ""THE CITY IS YOUR CAMPUS!"" I went to a CUNY before transferring to Columbia and went downtown with my friends to NYU and the East Village to drink. There is nothing stopping you, aside from money. The well-adjusted college students I've met all bounced around NYC—to include Queens, The Bronx, Upper Manhattan, even Jersey. The uncomfortable ones didn't leave their campus and dorms.

If you are that worried about prestige, I believe you can take four traditional courses at NYU. You can also apply for Internal Transfer if you do well. To be honest, the people I've met seem to recognize Polytechnic (before NYU bought it) more than Courant, aside from maybe Wall Street. There was some controversy with the name change.

The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, Senses Fail, Taking Back Sunday, My Chemical Romance, Motion City Soundtrack, The Academy Is..., Jimmy Eat World, ""Weezer"", the list can go on and on and on. If it had whiny vocals and screaming, or even just screaming (looking at you, Three Days Grace and Breaking Benjamin), I was sold.

Now what do I listen to?

It hasn't changed that much, actually. Still a fair share of Jimmy Eat World and Three Days Grace, and I just saw Breaking Benjamin two months ago, but it's a lot of more...uh, tasteful bands? I don't know how to put it. But bands where there's a lot more going on than screams and self-deprecating and dark lyrics. Where the music is the interesting part of the music and not just the vocals and angst of the lyrics. A lot of Queens of the Stone Age and Foo Fighters, Royal Blood, Weezer, the Pixies, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Smashing Pumpkins, Bush, Soundgarden, Gary Clark Jr, Biffy Clyro, Pearl Jam, bands that are more prone to having different sounds for different albums, if that makes sense. I also listen to some indie bands now, like The Shins or Lord Huron, or even some rap or some country or a lot of movie scores.

GCMC, practically a no-brainer for best rap album (and deserving of AOTY in my opinion) lost to Macklemore. 

MBDTF, by far the most acclaimed album of its year with a powerful narrative to boot, lost out to Adele's 21, a very solid but not particularly remarkable album. 

Sigh No More won album of the year even though it's considered mediocre at best by people who actually listen to folk/ indie music.

Morning Phase won even though it was a relatively safe, boring (though very enjoyable) album by Beck's standards.

Only two hip hop artists have ever won AOTY (Outkast and Lauryn Hill) despite the genre generally dominating pop culture. Both also strayed enough from the hip-hop formula to be digestible to the elitists that don't want to give hip-hop credit by mixing pop, soul, live instrumentation, etc.

Still, Kendrick has a lot going for him this year. He has the most socio-political relevance, by far the most critical acclaim, the POTUS just gave him a major shoutout, Taylor Swift wouldn't complain if he beat her, he has tons of nominations, and everyone including Macklemore knows he got snubbed on his last album. 

He also may have that 'not quite regular hip hop' quality Lauryn Hill and Outkast had thanks to all the live instrumentation, jazz, and funk throughout his album. 

I'd love for him to win because he obviously deserves it, but it doesn't mean anything if he loses. The Grammy's have been getting it so consistently wrong over the years that they've pretty much lost their relevance.

Lots of people go out and see the Oscars' Best Picture nominees because the Academy, while far from perfect, has a solid track record for rewarding quality. 

I don't know anyone who does the same with albums, and I think part of it has to be because the Grammy's track record hasn't earned the same level of influence. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,,t3_3wr15g,,,,,,,,,,,1450112119.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1451639409.0,,,

&gt; Despite having obvious musical chops, success has by no means been handed to Search The City on a silver platter. And much like a beautiful stone sculpture, this act’s final shape was first cut with sharp chisels and pounded with heavy hammers, before being rubbed smooth with rough sandpaper. As your high school gym teacher always said: no pain, no gain.

&gt; This Detroit, MI band recorded their first Tooth and Nail full-length, A Fire So Big the Heavens Can See It, in St. Cloud, FL with James Paul Wisner, who has also produced Dashboard Confessional, Underoath, and The Academy Is. While making this CD, the band fought off small town cabin fever, was restricted to bicycle transportation, and even shared a lake with an alligator. But such ordeals are colorful stories for another time because these guys are simply thrilled (but not to death) with the finished product.

&gt; The track “To the Moon for All I Care” is one of the group’s favorite new tunes. On the surface, one might assume it is based around what Ralph Kramden always told his wife Alice on the old The Honeymooners show. But as drummer Adam McMillion explains it, this song goes far deeper than that.

&gt; “The song is about our favorite movie, Danny Deckchair, which is about this guy that’s kind of fed up with his girlfriend who is not very faithful. And his job is really boring, so he decides to attach these balloons to his fold-up deckchair and he flies away,” McMillion says. When he finally lands, he’s in a faraway town, miles from everything and everyone he knows. “He kind of gets to start his life over, and we always thought that’s just such a cool concept,” McMillion continues. In fact, this song’s main character demands at one point, “Tell me about my future ‘cause I already know my past.”

&gt; Another noteworthy song has the intriguing title of “Detroit Is Built on Secrets”. This one takes on some of the nasty rumors oftentimes spread about rock bands – even about nice guys like Search The City. “So this is what we’re up against in this city of secrets,” states its anti-gossip lyric. But even when confronted with obvious lies, this thoughtful band still finds room for a little self-examination. “In the bridge it says, “Oh my God, forgive me for who I’m not,”” McMillion elaborates. “All these rumors are going around,” he continues, “but we’re still not the people we want to be. We’re still not the people God wants us to be. It’s just a cry out; kind of a confession. We wanna be better. We realize that we’re not who we should be.”

&gt; These closely bonded band members, which also include Alex Sheldon (guitar), Jim Czech (guitar), and Josh Frost (vocals), draw artistic inspiration from many loud and noisy sources, then translate these harsher sounds into surprisingly melodic, highly emotional songs.

&gt; “We’re more influenced by hardcore music than anything else,” Frost says of Search The City’s sound. “It doesn’t show so much because we’re pretty pop-y in parts. But collectively, we all love bands like Jimmy Eat World and bands like that.” So how would they describe their unique style? “We’d probably say progressive rock or something like that,” answers Frost.

&gt; Although the group is proud of their new CD, this band is truly in their element in concert. “Live is definitely Search The City’s favorite thing to do,” McMillion says without any hesitation. “It’s a chance to release a lot of emotion. We all love what we do onstage where we’ll just look at each other and just start laughing and smiling because it’s so much fun. Playing live is definitely the best part about being in a band.”

&gt; Search The City’s original nucleus, Sheldon, Czech, and McMillion, came up with the band’s Mapquest-like moniker while seeking out other musicians to complete their final lineup. “They named it that because they were looking for all of the different members, all over different cities,” Frost explains. “That meant all over Michigan. And because I was living in Florida at the time, they just called it Search The City.”

&gt; No doubt, Search The City succeeded in getting all their geographic coordinates correct.

&gt; After the band went their separate ways and onto some side projects, Frost and Czech have announced via Facebook and AboslutePunk.com has reported that they are back together and writing a second full-length album that's due out in the spring of 2012. Read more on Last.fm.

His unique ability to create memorable work across a variety of genres, as well as his reputation for being remarkably collaborative, have made him the first choice of top level producers and directors. Debney combines his classical training and a strong knowledge of contemporary sounds to easily adapt to any assignment.

&gt; Debney's career seemed almost destined for Hollywood. The son of Disney Studios producer Louis Debney, John grew up in nearby Glendale, Calif. where he began guitar lessons at age six and played in rock bands in college. Debney earned his B.A. degree in Music Composition from the California Institute of Arts (1979). After college, Debney's professional entry into the business came from television composing legend Mike Post (Magnum P.I., The Rockford Files, Law and Order) who gave the young composer his start. Debney furthered his hands-on training by working with Hanna-Barbera composer Hoyt Curtin. With this experience under his belt, Debney went on to score television projects as diverse as Star Trek: The Next Generation, A Pup Named Scooby-Doo and Sea Quest DSV, for which he won an Emmy for Best Main Title. In the early 1990s, Debney began to score films for indie projects. In 1993 he secured his first studio feature, the Disney comedy Hocus Pocus starring Bette Midler.

&gt; Debney has proven his versatility with films ranging from blockbuster comedies such as Elf, Liar Liar and Bruce Almighty, action adventures like The Scorpion King and Spy Kids (1 &amp; 2) to dramatic features including I Know What You Did Last Summer and Sin City. Although Debney had built an industry reputation as a talented composer, it was in 2004 that the rest of the world discovered him. Blending symphonic orchestra, a wide range of world instruments and the beauty of the human voice, Debney composed the landmark score for The Passion of the Christ. Strong in his faith, Debney was enticed by the idea of working on a project that held deep, spiritual meaning for him. The Passion of the Christ became one of the top ten box-office grossing films of all time, and his emotional score for the film connected with viewers and listeners and debuted on Billboard's charts at #1 on the Soundtrack and Christian Album charts and #19 on the Billboard Top 200. The record was certified gold by the RIAA and won the Dove award for Best Instrumental Album. The score was nominated for an Oscar in 2005. In July 2005, fresh off his success with The Passion of the Christ, he premiered The Passion of the Christ Symphony in Rome, Italy. The performance featured an 83-person choir and a 96-piece orchestra, and included special guest vocalist Lisbeth Scott and woodwind soloist Pedro Eustache, plus solo musicians from both the film and the classical worlds. The symphony was a success with the audience erupting into a 15-minute standing ovation catapulting Debney's success not just in Hollywood but worldwide.

&gt; For his most recent scores, Debney has enlisted world-renowned musicians, including violin virtuoso Joshua Bell on Dreamworks' score for Dreamer and trumpet legend Arturo Sandoval on the upcoming OutKast musical Idlewild. His upcoming projects include Sin City 2 &amp; 3 starring female box-office powerhouses Jessica Alba and Rosario Dawson, Evan Almighty, starring Steve Carrel and Morgan Freeman and animated feature Ant Bully. In the tradition of classical composers, John Debney enjoys conducting his own work. ""A big part of the joy in what I do is that I consider it an honor to stand in front of live musicians and have the opportunity to hear my music played by these talented people."" In addition to conducting some of the world's greatest orchestras performing his original works, Debney also conducted the Royal Scottish National Orchestra on a series of classic film scores for Varese Sarabande Records. He has been celebrated for incorporating a myriad of musical styles and techniques into his work, from contemporary beats to ancient instrumentation.

&gt; Only in his forties, Debney received ASCAP's prestigious Henry Mancini Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005. As director Robert Rodriguez perfectly described it, ""It's not the years, it's the mileage"". Read more on Last.fm.

His ill-gotten supply eventually runs out so he goes to Mexico to get some new treatment, none of which includes AZT or any other hard drug for that matter. Given that AIDS mostly affected homosexual men at the time, Woodroof was ostracized by his friends and co-workers. He eventually has to put his homophobic beliefs aside and works with another patient at the hospital to create a club where membership includes free medicine. This sidesteps the law against bringing drugs of any kind into the country and reselling them without a proper license. His friend Rayon (a memorable performance by Jared Leto) becomes his assistant and recruiter.
At the hospital, he is tended to by Dr. Eve Saks, who tells him that they are testing a drug called zidovudine (AZT), an antiretroviral drug which is thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients—and is the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for testing on humans. Saks informs him that in the clinical trials, half the patients receive the drug and the other half are given a placebo, as this is the only way they can determine if the drug is working. Woodroof bribes a hospital worker to get him the AZT.
In 2001, after one year of working on the script, they sold it to producer Robbie Brenner, who then set Marc Forster to direct the film for Universal Pictures, but left due to some personal delays. In June 2008, Craig Gillespie and Ryan Gosling were in talks to join the film, which was to be produced by David Bushell and Marc Abraham for Universal Pictures and Strike Entertainment. Chase Palmer was writing the script that time around, and screenwriters Guillermo Arriaga and Stephen Belber had reportedly also written the subsequent drafts for the film. In 2009, producer Robbie Brenner got involved again and rejected all the rewrites of the script, and the original version by Borten and Wallack was sent to actor Matthew McConaughey to see if the Dallas native would be interested in playing the role.
As soon as he begins taking it, he finds his health deteriorating (exacerbated by his cocaine use). In January 2014, Jared Leto has admitted that he was sent a script 15 years ago but never read it. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 93%, based on 227 reviews, with an average score of 7.8/10. Even if he was making fun of you, you wanted him to continue because he was so charming.
Stephanie Ochona reviewed for Renowned for Sound and gave the soundtrack 4.5 out of 5 ratings, she said, Set in the 80s where drugs and other experimentation was all the rage, music plays a big factor in the entire atmosphere of the movie. The soundtrack includes a diverse group of artists, from country stars, indie icons and modern rockers. All the songs featured help bring out the kind of mood a movie like Dallas Buyers Club is. Ochona also said that, Without such an accurate soundtrack, the film wouldn t have made such a big impact, and both the visual and aural aspects work together to create a beautiful story of a man fighting for the right to live his life. Music critic Green Baron reviewed the music for the Sputnikmusic, and said: Dallas Buyers Club itself was a breathtaking motion picture driven by the extraordinary performances from Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto.
Release Date: November 1st, 2013|1 hr. Leto was awarded an Academy Award, Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild Award and a variety of film critics circle awards. On October 3, 2012, it was announced that Swank had dropped out of the film and that Gael Garcia Bernal was in talks to play an HIV patient who meets Woodroof in the hospital and helps him in the club. I am glad to say they were correct.

The film grossed over $27 million domestically and $27.9 million internationally, the box office revenue returned over $55 million against a budget of $5 million in 182-days of a theatrical run. It grossed over $4.5 million from DVD, and over $3 million from Blu-ray sales. The film received widespread critical acclaim, resulting in numerous accolades. Most recognized the performances of McConaughey and Leto, who respectively received the Academy Award for Best Actor and for Best Supporting Actor at the 86th Academy Awards, making this the first film since Mystic River (2003), and only the fifth movie ever, to win both awards.
The Wrap s Alonso Duralde said why he watched the film, McConaughey is the only reason to see Dallas Buyers Club, but he s enough of a reason to see Dallas Buyers Club. Eve Saks were fictional; the writers had interviewed transgender AIDS patients, activists, and doctors for the film and combined these stories to create the two composite supporting roles. The writers created Rayon, to show Woodroof s gradual acceptance of a subculture he had dismissed. It seems that Matthew McConaughey gets better and better as an actor with each film he s in. Dallas Buyers Club at Box Office Mojo
These were the early days of the AIDS epidemic, and the U.S. Film critic Ty Burr reviewed the film for The Boston Globe and criticized, The movie s often touching and very watchable, but what gets you past the script s sincere calculation is the growing sense of rage toward a medical-industrial complex that saw AIDS sufferers as guinea pigs and sources of profit. Garner has also held the position of Artist Ambassador with Save the Children’s U.S. Vass, who has had his American medical license revoked, tells him that the AZT is poisonous and kills every cell it comes into contact with.
This sidesteps the law against bringing drugs of any kind into the country and reselling them without a proper license. Sadly, the film places ill motivations on behalf of the government and healthcare community in regards to the lack of treatment options.

In an interview, Borten revealed that he met Melisa Wallack in 2000 and asked her to help with the script, to which she said yes. In 2001, after one year of working on the script, they sold it to producer Robbie Brenner, who then set Marc Forster to direct the film for Universal Pictures, but left due to some personal delays.

Chase Palmer was writing the script that time around, and screenwriters Guillermo Arriaga and Stephen Belber had reportedly also written the subsequent drafts for the film.
Pick this up before or after you go and see Dallas Buyers Club. Matt of Homo Razzi said about the album, Overall this soundtrack has a little bit of everything and it works perfectly, mirroring some of the themes, emotions and moments of the film. Stephanie Ochona reviewed for Renowned for Sound and gave the soundtrack 4.5 out of 5 ratings, she said, Set in the 80s where drugs and other experimentation was all the rage, music plays a big factor in the entire atmosphere of the movie.

But other evidence indicates[Pg 17] that there may have been a separate stock for each of Newport s voyages, as was the case with each of the early voyages of the East India Company to the Orient. The so-called joint-stock company of that day rarely had a permanent joint-stock of the sort identified with the modern corporation. Instead, it functioned as a governing body representing all of the merchants engaged in a particular trade, who traded individually or through a variety of joint-stocks invested under the general regulation of the company. And such was the character of the Virginia Company.
More than that, he had quarreled with his ally of the preceding year, the Earl of Warwick, who had connections hardly less impressive than those enjoyed by Sir Thomas. The quarrel with Warwick was over a question of piracy, as Sir Edwin chose to regard it. One of Warwick s ships, the Treasurer, had sailed from England in April 1618 with a license to capture pirates, which was one way of getting a ship cleared from English ports for depredations against the Spaniard at a time when the king had set his face[Pg 45] against all such activity. The Treasurer had called at Jamestown, where Governor Argall, who had rendered important services to the colony but who had special reason to understand that his position in Virginia depended upon the good will of important members of the company, helped to outfit the vessel for a raid on the West Indies.
For me; I’ve loved everything about this series, and the finale was exactly what I wanted. Secrets revealed, lies exposed, romance galore and second-chances. I’m going to miss this world and these characters so damn much, but I thank Paula Weston for gifting readers this epic rollercoaster of a ride. A cow, a cowgirl and a divorcee walk into a bar.

From photograph in Virginia Historical Society. Author: Wesley Frank Craven Sarah Mayberry’s ‘Wait For Me’ was my favourite of the novellas – arguably because it has that cheating spouse storyline I weirdly like (I’m in the romance-reading minority on this one, trust me – I know) and probably because it had that hint of a ‘Nashville’ storyline with the country music scene (I admit: I went to a Keith Urban place.

Although Dan returns to work with Saul, he agrees to let Gretta release the album online and helps her to promote the release. The next day, Saul jokingly fires Dan again for promoting Gretta s album and informs him that it sold 10,000 copies in its first day of release. Keira Knightley as Gretta James, a songwriter Mark Ruffalo as Dan Mulligan, a music producer Adam Levine as Dave Kohl, Gretta s ex-boyfriend and a successful musician
New Zealand Albums (RMNZ) Undeterred, Dan proposes that he and Gretta produce their own album together, to be recorded live during the summer at various public locations around New York City. He believes that music is about sharing it with people, but Gretta tells him that s not what she intended for that song. The film s title was changed from Can a Song Save Your Life?
French Albums (SNEP) FOR THE LATEST TRAILERS: Spanish Albums (PROMUSICAE) Whether it s the latest studio release, an indie horror flick, an evocative documentary, or that new RomCom you ve been waiting for, the Movieclips team is here day and night to make sure all the best new movie trailers are here for you the moment they re released.
Some songs were written and composed by Glen Hansard and Carney, and most were performed by Knightley and Levine. The track Drowning Pool by The Walls, which played over the opening credit sequence, is not included on the soundtrack album. The song Lost Stars was nominated for numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Original Song and the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Song. Australian Albums (ARIA) Belgian Albums (Ultratop Flanders)
In a review for The Guardian, Paul MacInnes awarded the film 2 out of 5 stars and described it as a movie obsessed with authenticity but as phoney as a Miley Cyrus dance routine. The Chicago Sun-Times critic Bruce Ingram also found the film hypocritical, noting the slightly bogus vibe of the song performances that had been recorded in a studio but were meant to be played live. Begin Again at the Internet Movie Database. The latest film from writer-director John Carney (ONCE), BEGIN AGAIN is a soul-stirring comedy about what happens when lost souls meet and make beautiful music together. Gretta (Keira Knightley) and her long-time boyfriend Dave (Adam Levine) are college sweethearts and songwriting partners who decamp for New York when he lands a deal with a major label.

Scott Guthrie, Costume Supervisor : Wendy Talley, Set Costumer : Renee Ragucci Yes, now you can view movie of Wild Card completely length and find the link to this video Wild Card in best quality. Download Full Wild Card in Top Video Format
Since Nick knows everyone in the underbelly of Vegas, including a kingpin named Baby (Stanley Tucci), he easily finds the guilty party. Sadistic Mafioso Danny DeMarco (Milo Ventimiglia) and his henchmen cross paths with Nick at DeMarco’s hotel suite, ushering in the first instance of Statham doing what you paid to see him do. Rather than kill Danny, Nick merely roughs him up, paving the way for Holly to exact a humiliating, though non-lethal vengeance on Danny’s most prized possession. For his troubles, Nick is paid $50,000 in hush money from Danny’s stash. As Holly rides off into an avenged sunset, Nick heads for the nearest blackjack table to attempt the final big score that will hasten his exit from Sin City.
Having raised the stakes, Nick has one last play to change his fortunes.and this time, it’s all or nothing.

Eighty-six-year-old Irving Zisman is on a journey across America with the most unlikely companion: his eight-year-old grandson Billy, in Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa. Jackass characters Irving Zisman (Johnny Knoxville) and Billy (Jackson Nicoll) will take movie audiences along for the most insane hidden camera road trip ever captured on camera. Along the way Irving will introduce the young and impressionable Billy to people, places, and situations that give new meaning to the term childrearing. The duo will encounter male strippers, disgruntled child beauty pageant contestants (and their equally disgruntled mothers), funeral home mourners, biker bar patrons, and a whole lot of unsuspecting citizens. Written by Paramount Pictures PR.
Frustrated, Irving tries to ship Billy off to North Carolina in a box. He takes him to the post office, but because Billy keeps moving and speaking, the two women in the place open it and are shocked to find him in there. Before he can get in anymore trouble, he says he ll just take Billy back on the road. Irving leaves Billy in the car as he goes to a rec center to play Bingo.
Everyone, including the judges, are completely speechless. His wig falls off and the two run out. Irving drives up to a bridge where he and Billy finally get rid of Ellie s body by throwing it into the river. The two then proceed to fish, fulfilling Billy s desires.
Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 54 based on 29 reviews. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling at the 86th Academy Awards, but lost to the biographical drama Dallas Buyers Club. Ashley Clark of Time Out gave the film two out of five stars, saying In Bad Grandpa, there s no shock value: the physical comedy is down to a minimum, replaced by a creaking humour almost as dated as Zisman himself. Scott Foundas of Variety gave the film a positive review, saying Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa shows there s still comic life in this decade-old franchise - provided, of course, the sight of a senior citizen getting his penis caught in a vending machine is the kind of thing that brings a smile to your face.
Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa was released on DVD and Blu-ray on January 28, 2014. An unrated version of the film, titled Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa.5 which includes over 40 minutes of additional outtakes and interviews, premiered June 15, 2014 on MTV, and was released on DVD and Blu-ray on July 8, 2014.

The actor explains that filmmaker Rupert Wyatt was surprised by his choice to tackle this dialogue-heavy scene right away, but the actor says that he learned a trick from his time on The Fighter, where they got the most physical scenes done as soon as possible. We also hear from Brie Larson, who plays one of Bennett s students Amy. She reveals that Mark Wahlberg must have done that scene over 100 times, over the first two days of production, and watching him work was like acting 101 because every take was different and unique. Director Rupert Wyatt goes onto say that Mark knew that scene in his sleep, despite how complex it was.
Levinson now has an active feature slate, which includes The Gambler, Lone Survivor, Broken City, Contraband, and Kissing a Fool, to name a few.

The New Yorker described Margin Call as “one of the strongest American films of the year and easily the best Wall Street movie ever made.” Beaudreau and Chandor continued their successful partnership with the powerful and bold All Is Lost, a wordless, elemental survival film starring Robert Redford.

But Korean veteran Ahn Sung-kee manages some slivers of dignity as a fellow nobleman who comes to Raiden’s aide. The massive attack Raiden and his men stage on Gezza Mott’s fortress, which comprises the film’s final third, takes place in the dead of night with soldiers who are essentially interchangeable, so it’s often difficult to tell who is doing what to whom. This much is clear, though: There’s a lot of that metallic, sword-unsheathing sound, followed by a series of decapitations. And even those are no fun.

Academy Award Nominee Clive Owen delivers an electrifying performance in Last Knights. He stars as a fallen warrior who rises against a corrupt and sadistic ruler to avenge his dishonored master, Academy Award Winner Morgan Freeman. This is an epic, sword-clashing adventure full of loyalty, honor, and vengeance. Last Knights is a 2015 drama film directed by Kazuaki Kiriya and written by Michael Konyves and Dove Sussman, based on the legend of the forty-seven Ronin. The film stars Clive Owen and Morgan Freeman in the lead roles.
As Raiden s men infiltrate the estate, Auguste has secretly made a pact with Raiden to help him, in exchange for Raiden s help to free his daughter from her marriage to Geza Mott. Geza has always mistreated Auguste s daughter which, along with Bartok s execution, causes Auguste to see that his vicious son-in-law has no honour. Raiden and his men successfully infiltrate Geza s estate, are discovered, and need to face a large number of soldiers. Raiden s men fall one by one as they enter deep into Geza s estate.
Ahn Sung-ki as Auguste Tsuyoshi Ihara as Ito Park Si-yeon as Hannah Giorgio Caputo as Slim Tully James Babson as Fat Jim
There s action a plenty to keep the teenage boys interested, but the story is a little odd. The plot s unusual meandering isn t any easier to follow when crucial lines are spoken by a handful of actors whose accents are so thick, I had no idea what they were saying. Freeman brought a gravitas to a role that simply couldn t capitalize on it. Owen was great for his role, but Peyman Moaadi as the emperor was completely miscast. Last Knights would be my last choice at RedBox on a Friday night.

During one of his classes, Bennett identifies student Amy Phillips (Brie Larson) as a potential writing prodigy, having previously encountered her as a waitress at the gambling house. Bennett also singles out Dexter (Emory Cohen), a genius tennis star, and confronts Lamar Allen (Anthony Kelley), a student who does not pay attention in class and intends to become an NBA basketball player. Amy develops a personal interest in the professor. Bennett considers borrowing money from Frank (John Goodman), another loan shark, to consolidate his debts and buy himself some time, but refuses to do so after Frank s demands include that Bennett admit, I am not a man. Bennett convinces his mother Roberta (Jessica Lange) to give him enough money to pay off his debts, expressing no gratitude to her, then during a trip to a casino with Amy gambles it all away.

What s interesting to me in watching your career is that you re smoothly transitioning back and forth from these really funny lighter roles to these dark, gritty, more dramatic roles. The Gambler is a 2014 American crime drama film directed by Rupert Wyatt. Starring Robert DeNiro as a prominent director asked to “name names” and Annette Benning as his wife, the film presaged a writing and directing career that would, like Winkler’s producing career, be focused on taut human drama and politically-charged themes. His credits include the independent films XX/XY, Sympathy For Delicious and My Week With Marilyn, which earned Michelle Williams an Academy Award Nomination in 2011.

&gt; Glasgow’s C Duncan, born 1989, is the son of two classical musicians. Surrounded by music throughout his childhood, Christopher initially took up piano and viola. His teens led him to school bands – learning to play guitar, bass and drums – but did little to quell his fascination with the composition and performance of classical music. He eventually enrolled in Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland) to study music composition, where his pieces were performed by various ensembles across the UK.

&gt; To hear C Duncan’s music now is to grasp those two common threads between his interests in classical and modern music. The pieces that make up his forthcoming debut LP are formed from lush choral harmonies and acoustic instrumentation, textured like contemporary dreampop and all recorded at home in Glasgow on his bedroom studio setup, gradually built up one layer and one instrument at a time. The results of this methodical and isolationist recording process give us charming lo-fi folk with the harmonic width of choral composition, the sweetness of barbershop and the rough eloquence that has so readily soundtracked Glasgow over the past decades.

&gt; Christopher is also an accomplished painter, naming Grant Wood and Gerhard Richter as influences. His work has been exhibited throughout Scotland and he provides cover art for his own records, expressing the same musical ideas through painted image. Read more on Last.fm.

official plot version from weinsteinco.com. From acclaimed director Antoine Fuqua ( Training Day ) and screenwriters Kurt Sutter ( Sons of Anarchy ) and Richard Wenk ( The Mechanic ), Southpaw tells the riveting story of Billy The Great Hope, reigning Junior Middleweight Boxing Champion of the World (Academy Award® nominee Jake Gyllenhaal). Billy Hope seemingly has it all with an impressive career, a beautiful and loving wife (Rachel McAdams), an adorable daughter (Oona Laurence) and a lavish lifestyle. When tragedy strikes and his lifelong manager and friend (Curtis 50 Cent Jackson) leaves him behind, Hope hits rock bottom and turns to an unlikely savior at a run-down local gym: Tick Willis (Academy Award winner Forest Whitaker), a retired fighter and trainer to the city s toughest amateur boxers.
Billy The Great Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) is the reigning Junior Middleweight Champion whose unorthodox stance, the so-called Southpaw, consists of an ineloquent, though brutal, display of offensive fighting. His days now an endless haze of alcohol and prescription drugs, his daughter taken by Child Services and his home repossessed by the bank, Billy s fate is all but sealed until a washed up former boxer named Tick (Forest Whitaker) agrees to take the bereaved pugilist under his wing so long as he agrees to his strict ethos. ‘Southpaw’ Trailer 2 Puts Jake Gyllenhaal in the Boxing Ring Southpaw is one of the many Oscar contenders being released this fall, and buzz is high for Jake Gyllenhaal, who has completely transformed himself into a professional boxer, troubled by life. We have the second trailer released by The Weinstein Company, and Wanda Pictures, which puts some of Jake Gyllenhaal s physical talents on display.
On CinemaScore, audiences gave the film an average grade of A on an A+ to F scale. With his future riding on Tick s guidance and tenacity, Billy enters the hardest battle of his life as he struggles with redemption and to win back the trust of those he loves. From acclaimed director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) and screenwriters Kurt Sutter (Sons of Anarchy) and Richard Wenk (The Mechanic), Southpaw tells the riveting story of Billy The Great Hope, reigning Junior Middleweight Boxing Champion of the World (Academy Award nominee Jake Gyllenhaal). Subscribe to TRAILERS:
The incident drives Billy to become sober, but Leila cuts ties with him, blaming him for their predicament. At the behest of friends, Billy gets a job at a gym owned by seasoned boxer, Titus Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker), and eventually convinces Tick to become his trainer. Billy s former manager Jordan Mains (50 Cent), who is currently managing Miguel, arranges a fight between the two that could put Billy back in the spotlight. Tick is reluctant to train Billy, fearful he might be blinded by his vendetta against Miguel, but is motivated to do so when another of his students is killed by his abusive father while attempting to defend his mother.
Benjamin Nugent of The New York Times has compared the film to Robert De Niro stating, Pity Jake Gyllenhaal, who despite getting shredded for Southpaw, could not outbox the shadow of Robert De Niro s Raging Bull performance. Whether it s the latest studio release, an indie horror flick, an evocative documentary, or that new RomCom you ve been waiting for, the Movieclips team is here day and night to make sure all the best new movie trailers are here for you the moment they re released. Southpaw marks the first investment in an American film by WanDa Pictures, a division of Wang Jianlin s Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group.

Brenner selected the first draft, written by Borten and Wallack, for the film, and then Vallée was set to direct the film. It grossed $27,900,000 in foreign countries including $8,755,794 of the United Kingdom, $2,761,258 of Australia, making a worldwide total gross of $55,198,285. Craig Borten, Melisa Wallack He earned a People’s Choice Award for Sahara, directed by Breck Eisner, the first feature made by his production company j.k.
New Noise Magazines Joseph Tucker said, The score on this record is incredibly diverse and of equally incredible quality, unlike so many others. Pick this up before or after you go and see Dallas Buyers Club. Matt of Homo Razzi said about the album, Overall this soundtrack has a little bit of everything and it works perfectly, mirroring some of the themes, emotions and moments of the film. Stephanie Ochona reviewed for Renowned for Sound and gave the soundtrack 4.5 out of 5 ratings, she said, Set in the 80s where drugs and other experimentation was all the rage, music plays a big factor in the entire atmosphere of the movie. The soundtrack includes a diverse group of artists, from country stars, indie icons and modern rockers.
Leto s portrayal of Rayon, a drug-addicted trans woman with AIDS who befriends McConaughey s character Ron Woodroof, received critical acclaim. The writers created Rayon, to show Woodroof s gradual acceptance of a subculture he had dismissed. Time s Richard Corliss noted, Leto captures the sweet intensity and almost saintly good humor of a glamorous, poignant and downright divoon creature — a blithe Camille who may surrender her health but never her panache. Leto was awarded an Academy Award, Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild Award and a variety of film critics circle awards. After the 86th Academy Awards ceremony, the casting of a non-transgender actor was critiqued as a missed opportunity, with some LGBT activists criticizing the choice as misogynistic.
His other films include Brad Furman’s The Lincoln Lawyer; Mark Waters’ Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, with Jennifer Garner of Dallas Buyers Club; Ben Stiller’s Tropic Thunder; Andy Tennant’s Fool’s Gold; McG’s We Are Marshall; Tom Dey’s Failure to Launch; Dan Gilroy’s Two for the Money; Donald Petrie’s How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days; Rob Bowman’s Reign of Fire; Jill and Karen Sprecher’s Thirteen Conversations About One Thing; Bill Paxton’s Frailty; Adam Shankman’s The Wedding Planner; Jonathan Mostow’s U-571; Ron Howard’s EDtv; Richard Linklater’s The Newton Boys; Steven Spielberg’s Amistad; Robert Zemeckis’ Contact; Joel Schumacher’s A Time to Kill; and John Sayles’ Lone Star.

t5_2zj24,,,,False,,,4.0,,,,indieheads,,,,,,cx2yane,,,0,,,,rccrisp,,,t3_3t3azu,4,,,,,,"Ok so I'm probably going to go on a circley rant because I've always had a problem in general with award shows, doesn't matter the subject matter, all award shows have their failings. 

First off, all award shows are a circle jerk. The fact that they are almost always entirely voted by your 'peers' means there isn't any chance of anyone on the outside having a say as to who wins or loses. Basically any band that doesn't have enough muscle or sway in the industry is going to have a tough time even getting noticed by the Recording Academy.

However let's ignore that the Recording Academy is both limited and inept, covering only a strangely singular demographic of old white dudes to judge on ALL categories of music (hence shit like The Heist winning over Good Kid, M.A.A.D City.) In terms of immediate relevancy you can't deny that the Grammy's are relevant. Grammy winners almost certainly get a sale boost, people become notable after their Grammy wins. Usually something stupid or amazing happens at the Grammys so there is some immediate buzz. 

But not just the Grammys but ALL award shows have a problem: they're judging art in its time and the problem there is things that are good now may not be good in a year, or two years, or ten years. I truly do believe that there is art 'of its time', amazing in itsa context but once taken out it stars to lose its luster. The Grammys aren't the only ones guilty of this, when was the last time someone talked about such previously lauded indie acts like Clap Your Hands Say Yeah! or Tapes 'n Tapes? 

When everything is condensed, when you have AT MOST a year to dive into an album, and you need to consider hundred or thousands of albums and rank them, you lose sight of what makes things good, you don't allow albums that may need time to marinate in the brain to truly show their genius, you make snap decisions based on the most basic of reactions. You end up voting for an album that may not truly be the best because it was not listened to in ideal conditions. 

I know it would be weird but I've always wished someone would do something like 'the 5 years ago' Oscars or the 'the 5 years ago' Grammys just to see how different the nominations would be. I don't think they'd radically change, but you'd see some growers and cult albums/movies pop up, I'd believe. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,t3_3t3azu,,,,,,,,,,,1447734565.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1449847812.0,,,

Okay, maybe that didn t have to be done, because this film somehow managed to make it out without playing that song, which is surprising, because in most every other way, this film cheapens out to where you would expect it to go. Okay, this film is reasonably engaging, but I m one of the few people who will tell you that, so as if James Earl Jones didn t look desparate enough when he was on The Big Bang Theory as himself, managing to annoy Sheldon with his ramblings about Star Wars , just wait until you see his big film comeback through a January indie drama starring Vanessa Hudgens that no one else is going to see. Man, forget High School Musical , Sucker Punch , Machete Kills and, yes, even Beastly , for her presence mostly scares me because it brings to mind her last art drama, Spring Breakers.
But not everybody gets a happy ending. VANESSA HUDGENS (Agnes “Apple” Bailey) became a star in “High School Musical” but has branched out since then to play surprising and challenging roles in such films as Harmony Korine’s Spring Breakers, co-starring James Franco and Selena Gomez, and Scott Walker’s The Frozen Ground, alongside Nicolas Cage and John Cusack. She s been in and out of foster care for years, and her mother June (Rosario Dawson) is an abusive addict who only wants her for the welfare money she provides. How about the piece of garbage that is Escape From Tomorrow? Brendan Fraser, Rosario Dawson, James Earl Jones, and Ann Dowd co-star.
Previously, Dawson starred in Frank Coraci’s romantic comedy Zookeeper, opposite Kevin James, Adam Sandler and Jon Favreau; Tony Scott’s action thriller Unstoppable, alongside Denzel Washington and Chris Pine; Eagle Eye, opposite Billy Bob Thornton and Shia LaBeouf; Mark Webber’s political drama Explicit Ills, an Audience Award winner at SXSW; Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino’s tribute to exploitation films, Grindhouse, with Kurt Russell and Stacy Ferguson; Talia Lugacy’s Descent, which Dawson also produced; Dito Montiel’s A Guide To Recognizing Your Saints, opposite Robert Downey Jr., Shia LaBeouf, Dianne Wiest, Chazz Palminteri and Channing Tatum; Chris Columbus’ Rent, based on Jonathan Larson’s Pulitzer Prize-winning musical. Brendan Fraser as Tom Fitzpatrick The Movieclips Trailers channel is your destination for the hottest new trailers the second they drop. When she finds herself pregnant and alone, Apple temporarily takes shelter with her biological father, Tom (Brendan Fraser), a wealthy Wall Streeter living in a New Jersey mansion with his wife Joanna (Stephanie Szostak) and two young children. there in lock step with the media.
For two years, Krauss worked his way through each department of the Corman studios to learn every aspect of moviemaking. Krauss went on to direct countless music video and commercial productions but it was Puppies for Sale (1998), his first short film, which drew critical and international acclaim. The film, starring Academy Award®-winner Jack Lemmon, won “Best Short Film” at more than 20 film festivals worldwide, including Giffoni Film Festival, Berlin International, Rimouski International, Aspen Film Festival, Palm Springs and the Heartland Film Festival. Puppies also received the honor of being exhibited at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. KATHY DiFIORE (Inspired By) founded Several Sources Shelters with the idea of the “haves” helping the “have nots.” Several Sources Foundation helps the poor, the ill and the lonely, concentrating its efforts on inner-city children and their impoverished families in Newark, New Jersey.
When a pimp forces her into his vehicle to discuss business , Apple jumps into the driver s seat, speeds away and crashes the car. Filming started June 9, 2011. His first serious brush with Hollywood was meeting Roger Corman and being hired to work in the art department of Corman’s legendary Venice Beach studios. She is forced to leave her father s home because of her choice to give birth to the baby she is carrying.
Apple awakes in hospital where the Catholic Priest, Father McCarthy (James Earl Jones), is waiting to speak with her. Month January February March April May June July August September October November December Up next is the romantic comedy That Awkward Moment, with Zac Efron, Imogen Poots and Miles Teller. Previously, Dowd appeared as a series regular on “Nothing Sacred” and played recurring roles on “Freaks and Geeks,” “The Education of Max Bickford” and “Third Watch.” She has appeared multiple times on all of the various “Law &amp;amp; Order” series and guest-starred on “House,” “NYPD Blue” and “Louie.” Gimme Shelter Official Trailer 1 (2013) - Vanessa Hudgens Movie HD

More than Suffragettes Talks and Tour on 8 and 9 October 2015 at 2pm: £25 Women and men in Britain over the age of 30, meeting certain property qualifications, were given the right to vote in 1918, and in 1928 suffrage was extended to all women over the age of 21. Also, it is a popular myth that the colours were green, white, and violet, to spell GWV as an acronym for Give Women Votes. Following the refusal for suffragettes to be recognised as political prisoners, many suffragettes began to stage hunger strikes while they were imprisoned. Written by Production. Annie Jane Schnackenberg
Many suffragists at the time, and most historians since, have argued that the militant suffragettes actions actually damaged their cause. Opponents at the time saw evidence that women were too emotional and could not think as logically as men.
The use of force feeding had previously been practised in Britain, however, its use had been exclusively for patients in hospitals who were too unwell to eat or swallow food properly.
Edwardian Emporium page with a curious gallery of Suffragette supporters pin-badges. Emily Wilding Davison To celebrate the UK release of the feature film ‘Suffragette’, which includes scenes filmed at the Palace of Westminster, the Houses of Parliament is running a ‘Suffragette Season’ of special events and themed tours this October. This act made the hunger strikes legal, in that a suffragette would be temporarily released from prison when their health began to diminish, only to be readmitted to prison when she regained her health to finish her sentence.
For women to gain the right to vote it was necessary to demonstrate that they had public opinion on their side, to build and consolidate a parliamentary majority in favour of women s suffrage and to persuade or pressure the government to introduce its own franchise reform.

Michael Welch as Mike Newton, Bella s friend who has a crush on her. He joins her on a date with Jacob. In early November 2008, Summit Entertainment announced that they had obtained the rights to the remaining books in Stephenie Meyer s Twilight series: New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn.
The artists were able to observe the behavior of both the timber and arctic wolves, who ran in packs of three to five. The idea was to give everyone a deeper feeling of the creature that they were creating.

&gt; Esteban Mateus Williamson, better known as Esteman (born May 4, 1984) is a Colombian singer and songwriter.
Esteman has been developing his interest in music since the age of 12, as he attended several music and theatre academies, acting classes and college education in Electronic Media Arts. At a prodigiously young age Esteman started writing songs and school plays involving musical theatre for his elementary school and ever since, writing and performing has become one of his favorites activities. Later on, while he was in college, Esteman decided to pursue his music career full-time, he found in music a perfect space where he was able to focus in his main interest: music.
This is how Esteman's musical project begins, mixing styles and influences in order to build catchy melodies loaded with irony, where the plastic sounds of a synthesizer get together with percussion elements both usual and inusual, saxophones and old school guitars as we can hear in his first single ""No te metas a mi Facebook"" which translates ""Dont bother me on Facebook"".

&gt; With a careful fusion of elements where you can find eclectic pop, disco music, indie-pop, the most thought provoking lyrics and choreography, Esteman's project gets launched in the latin pop market with a musical, visual and performative proposal that will make you vibrate until the end of this song.

&gt; Glasgow’s C Duncan, born 1989, is the son of two classical musicians. Surrounded by music throughout his childhood, Christopher initially took up piano and viola. His teens led him to school bands – learning to play guitar, bass and drums – but did little to quell his fascination with the composition and performance of classical music. He eventually enrolled in Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland) to study music composition, where his pieces were performed by various ensembles across the UK.

&gt; To hear C Duncan’s music now is to grasp those two common threads between his interests in classical and modern music. The pieces that make up his forthcoming debut LP are formed from lush choral harmonies and acoustic instrumentation, textured like contemporary dreampop and all recorded at home in Glasgow on his bedroom studio setup, gradually built up one layer and one instrument at a time. The results of this methodical and isolationist recording process give us charming lo-fi folk with the harmonic width of choral composition, the sweetness of barbershop and the rough eloquence that has so readily soundtracked Glasgow over the past decades.

&gt; Christopher is also an accomplished painter, naming Grant Wood and Gerhard Richter as influences. His work has been exhibited throughout Scotland and he provides cover art for his own records, expressing the same musical ideas through painted image. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; It was in 2011 that Iceland's king of lo-fi layered lushness, Sindri Már Sigfússon released “Summer Echoes” as an album under the name of his solo-project Sin Fang (he had previously recorded as “Sin Fang Bous” and as ""Seabear""). The album oscillates wildly unearthing glimpses of familiarity - vintage Flying Nun here, Paw Tracks there and a Belle and Sebastian pop nous - while retaining the own stark originality of this uber-talented artist and producer. 

&gt; And Sigfússon is a pretty unlikely ambassador of the Icelandic indie pop scene: in his teens he was a skateboard and Hip Hop aficionado, his arms are covered with a colourful mess of self designed tattoos and besides doing visual arts his true favourite obsessions are soccer and pizza: what makes him pretty much an antidote to the all too present cliché of the Icelandic nature boy. Sigfússon didn’t pick up a guitar until he was 20 but after graduating from art academy and moving to London he became sick and bought his first proper home recording equipment from the insurance money he got. And within just a few years, his infamous work ethic (he has a very strict 9 to 5 routine working on songs in his basement studio) and distinctive do-it-yourself production style culminated in the Sin Fang (Bous) debut album “Clangour” which was released on Morr Music in 2009 to worldwide acclaim and suddenly propelled him in the midst of a new wave of bands redefining the indie rock game in thus far unexpected directions. 

&gt; Enthusiastic media and blog coverage and live shows in Europe, North America and Brazil followed. 

&gt; After having set himself the task of playing all instruments on his debut solo album ""Clangour"", this time around Sigfússon wanted to move closer to the sound of a live band and recruited a number of his friends from múm, Amiina and Seabear to record “Summer Echoes” in his own studio and Sigur Rós Sundlaugin studio. The arrangements are more band oriented, grander in scope and more transparent than their predecessor’s and there is a diverse breadth of sounds across ""Summer Echoes"" dozen songs, reaching from a heart-breaking intimate piano ballad like “Two Boys” to sudden outbursts of guitar noise in “Bruises”. Not even the one-off appearance of synthetic beats in ""Sing For A Dream"" sound out of place when drenched in Sin Fang's signature layered wash of sound and it is the album's first single, ""Because Of The Blood"" that encapsulates the essence of this album in an euphoric orchestral pop song that manages to merge epic tune sculpting with several layers of choir abundance. 

&gt; The fact that Sigfússon did not only write all the music but also was doing most of the recording and production promises a lot for his future and “Summer Echoes” conveys the feeling that the real story has only just begun: and in fact a next Sin Fang album is already fully written and Sigfússon shows no willingness to slow down. Summer Echoes will be released on Morr Music in March 2011. A limited edition Sin Fang 7"" featuring the non-album coverversions of Fleetwood Mac's ""Landslide"" and Simon &amp; Garfunkel's ""The Only Living Boy In New York"" is available as of December 2010 while the album's first single, ""Because Of The Blood/Two Boys"" will be out in February 2011. The artwork for the release was done together with Sigfússons partner Inga Birgisdóttir. Read more on Last.fm.

&gt; Cass McCombs (born in Concord, California in 1977) is an American singer-songwriter and performer.

&gt; An enigmatic folk nomad, McCombs is a quintessentially American artist; ""he's quietly become one of (the country's) finest chroniclers of fringe characters, a writer of heart-rending love songs and psychedelic odes to the natural world, a teller of tall-tales with a sense of humor dry as desert wood, and that rare folksinger who actually sings about the folk."" His vocals range somewhere between the anxious drone of Lou Reed, the hollow croon of Elliott Smith, the lilting melody of Morrissey, and the driving earnestness and complexity of bards such as Leonard Cohen or Bob Dylan. His lyrical style is alternately vivid and weary, laconic and yearning, or drifting into the high-spirited and whimsical.

&gt; After cutting his first EP, Not the Way in San Francisco in 2001, McCombs relocated to Baltimore, MD. There he released ""Not the Way"" in 2002 and recorded his first full-length, A, in 2003 on Monitor Records. He spent the next few years touring: playing All Tomorrow's Parties; and opening for bands such as Modest Mouse, The Decemberists, and Belle and Sebastian; before recording his second LP PREfection, which was released on 4AD in 2005. 

&gt; McCombs' subsequent releases have been on the highly successful British independent label Domino Recording Co. 2007's Dropping the Writ was named one of Amazon's Best Albums of that year. Catacombs was voted one of the 50 greatest albums of 2009 by Pitchfork Media, and features Academy Award-nominated actress and singer Karen Black on the track Dreams-Come-True-Girl. During this period, McCombs toured with the likes of Arcade Fire, Andrew Bird, Band of Horses, José González, Beach House, and The Walkmen.

&gt; Catacombs also established McCombs' relationship with engineer/producer Ariel Rechtshaid, member of The Hippos and Foreign Born, who produced Grammy-winning hit Climax for Usher, the Plain White T's Grammy-nominated No.1 platinum-selling single Hey There Delilah, and albums for Vampire Weekend, Sky Ferreira, Snoop Lion, and Haim, among others.

&gt; In 2010 McCombs played Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago, L.A.'s Culture Collide Festival and Invisible Children Benefit. 2011 offered an extensive headlining tour, an appearance at SXSW, and two albums released by McCombs and produced by Rechtshaid: Wit's End in April and Humor Risk in November. The two albums were made simultaneously. In an interview with Pitchfork, McCombs explains: ""Wit's End was started years ago and it slowly made its way to the finish line. Humor Risk was just punched out. They're friends but they're different. Wit's End is like a stew; Humor Risk is the raw food diet.""

&gt; Big Wheel and Others, McCombs' seventh full-length (and first double album) was released in October 2013. The album is rooted in the Americana mythos of the Wild West, from the San Francisco drug culture to the gunslingers and gold rush of the nineteenth century. The album once again features Karen Black on a version of the track Brighter!, her final recording before passing away due to ampullary cancer in August, 2013. Big Wheel is dedicated to her memory.

 [artist pic](http://img2-ak.lst.fm/i/u/252/9fd03c7702df473c93df5ae4954479fc.png)  

&gt; The first thing you realise when listening to Fossil Collective is that this is a band that do things differently. Beautiful melodic music, with rich glorious harmonies and meticulous attention to detail, it is as much an aural statement as it is a pleasure to listen to. Layer upon layer of harmony mixed with delicate uplifting sounds may well remind you of other artists, be it Neil Young, Simon &amp; Garfunkel or Midlake but this music is no mere imitation. Whilst Fossil Collective's songs tip their cap to these classic musicians, scratch the surface and you discover something more contemporary, yet equally as rewarding.

&gt; It seems impossible that something so sonically complete could appear as if from nowhere, but Fossil Collective, the Yorkshire two-piece have been perfecting their craft and working towards this moment for years. Consisting of multi-instrumentalists David Fendick and Jonny Hooker, both were local musicians from the Leeds music scene, whose paths had crossed at various points in different bands. 'What separated Jonny from the other people I'd met was his total commitment to music' begins Dave. 'Whereas other people we were around were in bands for somewhat clichéd reasons, our focus was the music and the songs and for that reason we gravitated towards each other'. After a successful album with Leeds band Vib Gyor, the duo decided to strip everything back and start again.

&gt; Jonny reminisces, ""we felt we had to fold our cards and be honest to ourselves. We were listening to the kind of music we grew up with. (Neil Young, Fleetwood Mac, The Beach Boys, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, James Taylor) We decided there and then to try and capture the essence of that traditional songcraft, to strip everything back to the song, lyrics and melody'' Dave steps in ""It was actually very liberating to be able to do that"".

&gt; Armed with 3 roughly prepared demos, the duo found themselves looking for a recording studio. 'We had no money at all, but our friends had a modest little studio in a crypt just outside of the city' says Dave. 'It was a totally surreal place to go to as it was in the middle of nowhere. We had to stop recording at various points during the day as the main church was directly above the crypt. Whenever there was a mass or a wedding for example we had to be quiet - like little church mice scurrying about downstairs.’ However, a week of intense recording paid off, and they re-surfaced with 3 songs that would become their self released 'Honey Slides' EP. 

&gt; Jonny explains. 'Before we had even decided on the name Fossil Collective we realised that we wanted this project to be a continual running order of like-minded local artists. We worked on the principle that if we surrounded ourselves with an evolving stream of people we admired then our music would never become stale. Keeping away from the constraints of a 'typical' band dynamic would keep it open and interesting for us. If we wanted a harpist we'd go and find one, If we wanted a cellist we'd go and find one and so on.'

&gt; Knowing they were on to something special they wanted something visual to reflect this. Enlisting the help of Leeds animator Ashley Dean (Broken Pixel) was the next logical step. ‘Ash is a good friend and a like-minded independent local artist. We played him On &amp; On and asked him to interpret the song.’ The result was the stop/start animated video of a courtship between a wolf and a stag that went viral on youtube, getting over 250,000 hits in 2 weeks. 

&gt; Once they put their heads above water, things started happening very quickly. Their 3rd gig was at Shepherds Bush Empire, supporting Benjamin Francis Leftwich. ""It was great because other artists were contacting us, saying how much they liked our music and inviting us to tour"" remembers Jonny. ""It was sudden, but we were lucky to have great network of friends to come play with us and help interpret the songs live … after all, who is going to turn down the chance to play Shepherds bush Empire!"" The band did a full tour with Ben and then another UK support with soul singer Ren Harvieu.

&gt; On 11th June 2012 Fossil Collectives Debut EP 'Let It Go' was released. Lead track was 'Single of the Week' on iTunes USA, opening the doors to a lot of new fans. It received plays and support from Mark Riley, Radcliffe and Maconie, Chris Hawkins and Steve Lamacq at 6 Music. It also won the 6 music rebel playlist. Radio 2 support came from Bob Harris, Mark Radcliffe and an extremely supportive Dermot O'Leary who invited them in for a chat and to perform on his Saturday Radio2 show.  'Let it Go' also made the XFM playlist, the Q playlist &amp; the NME 'A' list. A 10 date headline tour coincided with this, selling out in Manchester &amp; London in a matter of days.

&gt; The band built on this success by releasing the 'On &amp; On' EP on 22nd October. Receiving the same support from radio, they were also invited in to record an infamous Daytrotter Session. Press support came from Sunday Times, Time Out, The Fly, The Independent &amp; NME. It was at this point that The Civil Wars starting tweeting about how much they were enjoying the music. A few friendly emails later and Fossil Collective were supporting them at the key gigs of their UK tour. (Camden Roundhouse, Manchester Apollo, Glasgow 02 Academy) 'We feel privileged to play anywhere though' says Dave - be it our last sell out London show to a couple of hundred people, or a few thousand people at Camden Roundhouse. What is important is that we always stay true to ourselves and the music.'

&gt; After a winter spent locked away in the studio, Fossil Collective came out of hibernation with “Tell Where I Lie” in hand – their beautifully crafted, ten track, debut album. The album hit record stores on April 8th 2013, the same day the band were invited into Bob Harris’ Radio 2 studio to record a two track session. Released to rapturous acclaim from both fans and critics alike; “Tell Where I Lie” was named iTunes’ ‘editors choice’, quickly climbed to number 1 in the US ‘New Artist Billboard Chart and graced the pages of Clash, Q Magazine, NME, Drowned In Sound and Hunger. 

&gt; With  extensive UK and US tours scheduled for the rest of the year, it’s looking to be a very productive 2013 for the band. ""We look back to just over a year ago"" says Dave ""When it was just the two of us sitting in Jonny's house with a couple of acoustic guitars working on those first ideas - it's incredible how much we have achieved in such a short amount of time""

&gt; At least one thing is certain - in another 12 months, many, many more people will have fallen for the intense song writing of Fossil Collective. Music like this cannot be kept a secret for long.

&gt;When it started, hardcore dancing was only *stylized* violence, an expression of the clamor and aggression of the music, and of the participants' adolescent inner tumult. ""It was a lot of fun,"" said Dischord [Records, a seminal D.C.-based hardcore/punk/indie label founded by Minor Threat's Ian MacKaye which still puts out excellent records to this day] stalwart Cynthia Connolly of a typical early Minor Threat show. ""It was a group of people having a real good rowdy time.""...""It was completely a reaction to the Bump, the Hustle, all these fuckin' dances,"" MacKaye explains.

To see how we got to that point, let's explore some background.

By 1981, punk was considered a dying genre. The Sex Pistols broke up in '78. The Clash had started incorporating new styles on  *London Calling* and *Sandinista!* (1980) moved the band even further from their punk roots by incorporating dub, reggae, r&amp;b, roots rock, and even rap. Even the Ramones had released their best albums already and had enlisted Phil Spector to produce *End of the Century* in 1980 in a bid to create a more polished, mainstream album. Many of the early fans and band members had moved on to arty post-punk like Television, Wire and Mission of Burma or new wave like Joy Division and Siouxsie and the Banshees. Some of the early bands evolved into a more mainstream sound such as Talking Heads and Blondie.

The inauguration of Ronald Reagan in 1981 also seemed to herald a new age of American conservatism. Hardcore actually sprung up in the well-to-do, Reagan-supporting suburbs surrounding Los Angeles and Washington D.C. as a reaction to the conservative milieu the kids were growing up in. Writer Barney Hoskyns said the new music was ""younger, faster and angrier, full of the pent-up rage of dysfunctional Orange County adolescents who'd had enough of living in a bland Republican paradise."" Hardcore was essentially the style of early Ramones, Clash and Sex Pistols distilled to its essence. Kids with limited music ability were playing punk as fast and loud as they could and infusing it with a raw anger that was markedly different from the political anger of early punk bands (although hardcore certainly had political elements to it). To give you an idea what kind of anger we're talking about, there's this quote from Henry Rollins:
&gt;There's a lot of people with a lot of fury in this country - America is seething at all times. It's like a Gaza Strip that's three thousand miles long.

Black Flag was the flag carrier for hardcore with roots in a band called Panic formed in Hermosa Beach, California in 1979. Panic was formed by Greg Ginn, Keith Morris and Chuck Dukowski who formed the core of Black Flag. The band found gigs at Hollywood venues tough to come by because the older bands and fans in the city disdained the amateur, working-class style (jeans, t-shirts, sneakers, long hair) and sound of the bands from the suburbs, favoring the safety pins, studs, mohawks, leather jackets and sounds of 1977-era British punk. Instead of traditional gigs, the band started playing parties around Orange County which inspired a fast style of short songs that allowed the band to play as many songs as possible in as short a time as possible. Greg Ginn said this about it:
&gt;That's where we really developed the idea of playing as many songs in as little time as possible because it was always almost like clockwork - you could play for twenty minutes before the police would show up. So we knew that we had a certain amount of time: don't make any noise until you start playing and then just go hard and long until they show up.

This new style of punk quickly attracted the attention of the cops who routinely broke up shows which degenerated into near riots. The kids tended to be bigger, more athletic and less drug-addled than older punks and showed a willingness to fight back against the police. At least a dozen Black Flag shows ended in violent confrontations between punks and police in 1980 and 1981. Soon, hardcore bands were banned by many LA clubs. An editorial in an LA paper was titled ""The Black Flag Violence Must Stop!"". Black Flag eventually started attracting people looking for violence, which the band did nothing to discourage. Henry Rollins said:
&gt;One of the main rallying war cries for us was ""What the fuck, fuck shit up!"" Literally, that was one of our slogans.

The band even went so far as to create radio ads for their shows in which they mocked the LAPD, including Police Chief Daryl Gates by name. Their shows were loud, fast, and violent, especially after Henry Rollins joined the band as lead singer. Rollins had attended a military academy while growing up in D.C. and was an angry, violent, physically intimidating person with a charismatic stage presence. He often got into fights or ended up bleeding at shows. Rollins wrote in his tour journal *Get In the Van* about a German show:
&gt;I bit a skinhead on the mouth and he started to bleed real bad. His blood was all over my face

In Vienna, Rollins was hit in the mouth with the mic, spit on, burned with a cigar, and punched in the jaw before cops showed up. The cops were beaten up, had their uniforms stolen, and allegedly had their police dog killed.

The other important band for the evolution of hardcore and moshing is Minor Threat. Minor Threat formed in Washington D.C. having been heavily influenced by Black Flag. Minor Threat shows, like Black Flag shows, were fast, angry and violent. Ian MacKaye said:
&gt;I was nineteen...and I was furious - the evolution of punk rock had grown from these silly kids to being embattled silly kids to being embittered silly kids, then embittered kids and then *violent*, embittered kids. It just kept getting ratcheted up.

The fans basically followed the violence of the band, music and police. The shows were often fight-filled anyway and there's not a huge jump from fighting to slam dancing. Moshing was yet another release of violent energy and tension that matched the energy of the music. Hardcore shows became cathartic bombs of energy being released and mosh pits were a natural way of ""dancing"". Furthermore, as Azerrad writes, 
&gt;Hardcore punks were happy, even determined, to limit their appeal. The music was resolutely unmelodic, humbly recorded, and vastly unsexy. It was a point of honor not to reach out beyond their own nationwide tribe. It was not only a way to cement a fledgling community, but like slam dancing itself, it was also a way to feel powerful at a time in life when one can feel particularly powerless

Unfortunately, over time, hardcore's violent reputation, fed in part by slam dancing, began to attract people who were interested merely in the violence and turned the scene from a way for friends to release pent up aggression into a hostile, fight-filled environment. The varying scenes spawned gangs that often beat up bands that came in from outside the area, moshing crossed the line into straight up fighting and the scene started to disintegrate as earlier, core scene members began to drop out. Black Flag moved towards metal starting with *My War*, Minor Threat and other vital early bands like the Faith broke up and the first wave of hardcore began to peter out by 1983 or 1984. As Ian MacKaye said ""I'm tired of being run into by fucking marines.""

**Fish Tank** Andrea Arnold, 2009. 

Too long have I ignored recent British cinema. Apart from her Oscar-winning short *Wasp* and her latest *Wuthering Heights* I have not seen much out of Arnolds oeuvre. She is rightfully praised for both her writing and directorial skills, and *Fish Tank* is a moving, emotional and important film which ceases the viewer with its stylistic portrait of England ghettolife. Its a beautiful and at the same time disgusting film that is captured with an engaging eye. Some shots are just all out perfect, like the little girl running on the beach in slow motion. Beautiful camerawork and captivating writing really goes a long way. This film is a reason in itself to love and endorse indie cinema. 5/5. 

****
**Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans** Werner Herzog, 2009.

This was one hell of a film. It works on so many different levels, blending so many different styles and qualities in various layers. It works as a cliché cop film, as a semi-political satire and even as a dumb drug-flick in the style of *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas*. I'm inspired by Herzogs decision to even make this from the start, and doing the way he did. You can watch it and go: ""well this is an absolute piece of cliché shit"", or just enjoy the superb acting by Nicholas Cage. You can even dive into the extremely well-executed critique of Hollywoods portrayal of racialized communities. Too me it had a few obvious problems but then I am not sure I picked up on every trail. As a viewer I was just crippled with possible interpretations that I sometimes felt like maybe it was just me overanalysing everything. When I read other reviews of this film, most people seem to miss out on the fact that it is such a complex film. It's just NOT what it looks like. Anyways, go see it - you'll both laugh at Cage's magnificent performance and feel terribly sad when you realise what Herzog is really trying to say. Plus there's some POV-shots from Iguanas. 4/5.
****
**Altered States** Ken Russel, 1980.

Never have I felt this weird after watching a film. I'm pretty sure it had som psycho-active effect on me because I felt actually high afterwards (!?). The long, intense audiovisual ""trips"" were interestingly composed and extremely captivating. I found out afterwards that it was nominated for Academy Awards for both best music and best sounddesign, which is undeniably understandable. Overall I think the technical aspects of the film were ingenuous and it really feels like it was before its time. I stumbled upon this movie by pure accident, and I was surprised I had never heard of it before. It seems like a forgotten cult classic, buried under the legacy of heaps of 90-indie-cult films. The subject, dialogue and technical winnings of Russel and original writer Paddy Chayefsky (under the pseudonym Sidney Aaron) is outstanding, although narratively and plot-wise I was not too impressed. In total a superbly weird, mind boggling film with traces of pure genius. Probably 4/5.
****
**Cries and Whispers** Ingmar Bergman, 1972. Rewatch.

This is my second go trying to enjoy this film as much as others, but I don't seem capable of. In light of Bergmans other films I just can't appreciate this enough. To me it falls flat, with a mildly interesting but inherently boring story, if I am allowed to use such words. He deals with the same themes so much better in other films. For me it's the same as watching Scorsese films; I'm just not interested. And that being said, I truly love Bergman. Don't know what more to say. 3/5. 
****
**The Pledge** Sean Penn, 2001. 

I watched this film because Ebert praised it. Why, I don't really know. It's an outdrawn, quasi insightful movie that didn't move me. Maybe I'm just sick of overprotective men protecting little girls, I mean is there a more exploited concept? Although this film is pre-*Taken*, which saves me from completely hating it. Not only did *The Pledge* make me less interested in Penn as a director, but it also proved my point that Ebert isn't as insightful of a filmcritic as he is known to be. Some aspects of the film, like the camerawork and depiction of a man sliding into possible madness did please me though. I do love Penns *Into The Wild*, and theres some connections between these two films that also gets me.  Weak 3/5. 
****
**Lost River** Ryan Gosling, 2015. 

Goslings directorial debut features some very strong visual experiences but is profoundly underdeveloped and, frankly, dumb in its writing. I wish he would have not written this himself. He has such an unique talent for directing, and with his experience in recent years with outstanding indie films and directors he truly has a good eye for moody dramas. Unfortunately not for writing. I'm hoping to see him develop and his career surely looks promising. Strong 2/5. ",,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,t3_3altsy,,,False,,,,t1_csdwxtr,,,,1434905656.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1437235561.0,,,

Until he was about 15, he started getting into wrestling in High School, he thought this was his chance to be just like his idol, by following in his footsteps, he would end up being one of the best amateur athletes in the State of Michigan winning many championships. At age 24 (he's around 27-28 modern day) he decided to get into MMA, while not making it as far as his idol Brock Lesnar, he was mildly successful. Now Troy seeks to enter the Squared Circle, Having just graduated from Storm Wrestling Academy, Troy spent a few years time in the Indies and now seeks to make it on the Big stage, and will do anything and everything in his immense amount of physical power to get what he wants.

Entrance Music: Indestructible - Disturbed ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj2vU2nr5Jw )

Entrance Text: As the sounds of warfare play over the speakers, the lights go out, all except for one spotlight, it acts as one on a helicopter, frantically searching for survivors from the horrid conflict that must be taking place, when it spots a hooded man on the entrance ramp, as the music kicks on the man rips off his hood as the lights roar back on, Troy looks around, studying the crowd with a look of disdain, he slowly walks down the ramp to the ring, ignoring all the boos from the fans as he is focused on nothing but plowing through his opponent. he then paces back and forth at the side of the ring until he leaps on top of the apron, his face like stone as the climbs through the ropes and does some quick warm ups waiting for his next potential victim.

All three members are immensely talented and underrated - Virginia Astley's known for an album called From Gardens Where We Feel Secure which is instrumentals and garden sounds, and a single ([""Love's A Lonely Place To Be""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHhXc0v6jkw&amp;ab_channel=MelodyDream)) which reached #8 on the Indie Chart. Kate St. John spent some time with The Dream Academy, then did a few albums in the 1990s (I have no idea if she released any singles, but this is an example of her music: [""Indescribable Night""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdFxIsPLkz4&amp;ab_channel=wittydud)). Nicky Holland did some work with Tears For Fears, then had a brief solo career (a couple of singles, and [""Running Around Again""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqDuy2ueDyo&amp;ab_channel=ultimafuelie) apparently got some airplay).

Brooklyn:

-Rough Trade East (Huge two story shop, tons of stuff, a little expensive but the atmosphere and stuff to do there besides buying vinyl is awesome. Worth checking out even if you don't buy anything)
-Earwax Records (Cool little shop, only about a block away from Rough Trade. Fair prices, usual releases, some really rare and obscure picks, a lot of experimental stuff as well.)
-Academy Records (Haven't personally been, but my Boyfriend said that it has a really great electronic selection and decent prices)

-I've also heard that Captured Tracks and the Fool's Gold stores are great as well.

Manhattan:

-Bleecker Street Records (Two story shop, decent selection, some stuff runs a little pricey but overall it's not too bad)
-Rebel Rebel Records (Small shop, good selection, pricey)
-Generations Records (Two story shop, heavy punk influenced selection but there's still quite a bit of other genres to pick through)
-Other Music (Definitely a top pick among a lot of people, good sized shop with a lot of electronic and indie releases, also have a good discount section. If you go to any of these, definitely go here.)",,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,t3_36bvx6,,,False,,,,t1_criw16a,,,,1432427608.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1433232156.0,,,

I've been working non-stop for this dream since I got my first laptop when I was 15, I've just now turned 22 this week.

When I reflect on the progress I've made so far, and keep in mind that most of my producer/dj friends who've made that their jobs so far are between 3 and 5 years older than I am, I'm pretty optimistic that I'll at least have my first EP released by then.

Lately though, other things have become live goals as well, and I've been through some personal struggles trying to decide what direction to take. Those other professions would be professional (self-employed or freelance) concept artist/illustrator, and indie game-dev.

Both of those goals seem pretty realistic to me as well, as I've been drawing since before I could properly hold a pencil, have studied Illustration and Graphic Design for 5 years in high school, and went to an extra curricular art academy for 3 years prior. Right now I'm studying multimedia technology with an emphasis on programming and web-design in college, and I'm working on some games in my spare time.

In other words: I know what I want, and I'm optimistic that I'll get what I want/become what I want to become in the long term. ",,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,t3_35er4h,,,False,,,,t1_cr4enh3,,,,1431256906.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1432875949.0,,,

I second /u/adambrabbin's recommendations, this weather won't last for long so try to get outside before the clouds come back - I live by the Whitworth, the gallery is nice (it's free) as is the park. 

I also love the museum by the Uni, it has a small vivarium with some really cool animals. If you want to do some shopping there's the Trafford center further out of the city, (which also has a conjoined aquarium) or the Arndale is within easy reach - almost any bus from Oxford road will end up at Picadilly Gardens which is a five minute walk away. 

If your girlfriend likes anything alternative/indie, try shopping at Afflecks. (also near Picadilly Gardens)

Music; Manchester if famous for it. If you like Indie music there's a huge selection - the [Academy](http://www.manchesteracademy.net/Menu%20Pages/gigcalendar.html) on Oxford Road plays some great, smaller bands so you've got a good chance of finding something at short notice. Muse actually played there a few weeks ago. With luck you might be able to catch something at the [Manchester Arena.](http://www.manchestertheatres.com/manchesterarena.htm) Olly Murs is playing..?

I first heard Porter way back in 2011 when ""Say My Name"" started taking over the Beatport charts and complextro was a new trend. This was when Zedd and Madeon were just emerging too. I've been a Porter fan ever since and have followed his musical direction closely.

Before Worlds, I was becoming very disenchanted with electronic music. I got sick of the obnoxious route that electro house was taking, so it was incredibly refreshing to be introduced to a more melodic enchanting side of electronic music with ""Worlds"".

I'm currently working on an EP with sounds heavily influenced by Porter and Flume and will be putting up track previews in the weeks to come.

 Is there something I'm  missing or is it actually this easy? Because I can almost crank out 100 exercises a night no problem. Why don't people do this a lot?

 It is quite fun to do the lessons while jamming out but is the actual work anything like me getting high and listening to indie music typing up functions and  strings?

Pressure at Thekla on a Thursday is buy one get one free on all drinks. Again, indie and pop punk mostly. 

Syndicate on a Saturday is awful, but it's dirt cheap. Expect pop music.

Propaganda at the Fleece on a Saturday is one of my personal favourites. Indie music, very laid back and reasonably cheap. 

The Lanes do different nights on Saturdays, although the crowd can be a bit shitty.

I turned those long stretches of solitude into long stretches of pampering. I wake up an hour earlier than usual, make a cup of tea. Sit and read the [good] news for a little while. Take a long luxurious shower or bath before as sun comes up. Listen to a learning program while showering, like RadioLab or ThingsYouShouldKnow, ThisAmericanLife, something enriching but lighthearted. Maybe get a good cry out before the day really starts. 

Then, even if I have nothing else going on, I'll get [reasonably] dolled up, just so I love me when I look in reflective surfaces. Then I'll walk to get a cup of coffee and sit and read a book in a café or bookstore. Maybe I'll put on headphones and get some more learning done from a free online course of some sort (I'm in love with Khan Academy.) 

Clean the apartment real quick, just a quick sweep, dust and mop. Nothing feels better than coming home to a clean home. Probably listen to some dance music to shake my 'tox to while I clean, something I can sing along to at the top of my lungs because fuck the neighbors, today is about me. 

Hours later, walk to the grocery store and pick up some fresh fruit and veggies to make dinner. I'll try out a new recipe and take my time, meticulous and slow prep to waste some daylight but also so my meal comes out as it should. I'll listen to classical music or hymns or something to soothe my soul and mind quiet. By the time food is done, sun is going down. Pour a glass of wine, have a small, early meal watching a documentary or a indie film. 

Throw open all the windows, turn down the lights, light some candles and some incense. Take selfies in the dark for an hour before the make-up is all gone. Rub one out. Give myself a manicure and pedicure by candlelight with another cup of sleepy time tea. Curl up under a blanket on the couch and dick around on the internet for a while, maybe window shop online but never buy anything. Maybe do some yoga, then take another quick shower. Spend some extra time flossing my teeth.

Rearrange the furniture. I should have done it earlier in the day but now I've got my second wind and an itch for change or closure. Then, smoke a bowl and go to bed watching Cosmos. 

It's not much, it probably sounds like work, but I find keeping my mind actively engaged in learning and enrichment helps me feel better about me or whatever else is going on in my life. Like, even if everything else sucks, at least I'm making me a better me through meditation and knowledge. I find taking a day to reset all the harm I've done to my body in rushing through my days helps reset negative feelings about myself. Plus, the physical actions of walking and cleaning and moving furniture help burn off some of that pent up frustration so that I can sleep fast and sound. None of it does anything to address my real troubles but it's a gentle reprieve, just for one day.

Does GotG deserve best picture? Hell no, it doesn't. Still, even if you have a problem with it's acting or script, it wasn't even nominated for best costume design, or special effects.

Also, I don't know why Dan is defending the Oscars, Nightcrawler wasn't nominated even once. It is VERY apparent that the Oscars values accuracy over talent. Eddie Redmayne did a wonderful portrayal of Hawking, but I much preferred Jake Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Lou. However, Lou is fictional, and for some reason, the Oscar's has a real problem with originality. It's confusing to say the least. Hell, even Birdman is based on Michael's life, AND he plays the title role. It deserved best adapted screenplay, not original.

I'm not saying that all comic book movies are better than indie movies, but it is IMPOSSIBLE to say which one is better. Objectively, you can think whatever you like, but to say which is truly better is ridiculous. Just as fashion, music, and entertainment in general are largely subjective, you can't just decide one's better than the other. That's why shows like Project Runway, or The Voice are so damaging. Just because you're a famous designer doesn't mean you know what's best for everyone.

I got a little off track there.

I'll sum this up with a comparison: Hannibal Lecter and Solomon Northrup. 

Chiwetel Ejiofor's portrayal of Solomon was masterfully done. He very convincingly made us believe he really was Solomon, who was, in fact, a real person.

Anthony Hopkins, however, made us convinced that he was someone that not only is nearly his polar opposite, but someone who doesn't even exist at all. Ted Bundy is close, but Hannibal is fiction.

Which is more impressive, making people believe you are someone else, or someone who doesn't even exist? It's impossible to say, but we can agree that an academy should acknowledge both.



Of course, awards in general are complete bullshit, so who cares? They are meant to do 2 things: Create publicity and make money. So really, it's nicer not to be nominated, as you aren't forced to sit through 4 hours of a complete and utter waste of time to sell ads.",,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,t3_2x11x4,,,False,,,,t1_covywzo,,,,1424813278.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1427434830.0,,,

First off, let me say that from my very brief encounter with them, the dudes in The Maine seem like really cool, chill dudes. They've got a good on-stage vibe and made easy conversation at their signing. 

I hate The Maine and attribute their signature sound to the rise of a lot of really terrible mid-to-late '00s pop-punk bands. The Academy Is toured with them and then put out a stinker of a followup to *Santi.* Mayday Parade toured with them and then put out a middle sophomore album (yes, I know there was a lot more going on there). Then you've got The Cab, CIWWAF, FTSK, post-SWIR All Time Low, etc. This was a sort of awkward pre-easycore, pre-""pop-punk renaissance"" time that a lot of crap was coming out of the scene. I'm sure the proliferation of that sound wasn't The Maine's fault, but they were the ones I saw rising first and dragging similar bands up with them. 

It's still pop-punk, but it's so smoothed over and overproduced. Bands were crossing over into the mainstream and a lot of people wanted in on it. The result was something that I find polished, vapid, and lifeless. Pop-punk was lacking identity at the time-- it wasn't the new thing growing out of punk rock anymore and a lot of the hallmark bands had gotten old. 

It wouldn't be until a little later that it found its voice in a way that wasn't tied to mainstream sensibilities: The Wonder Years, Into It Over It, Title Fight, Fireworks, Transit, Polar Bear Club. I know there is some overlap in these two eras, but right now the bands I listed are *really* en vogue in the pop-punk scene and even the indie music scene at large. 

As for this new song, it isn't as tacky as their old songs, but it's still substanceless. Putting the words on the screen is a weird choice when the lyrics are so profoundly uninteresting. It sounds more grown up, but that's pretty much it.

Here's where we could get some weird flip-flop between *Boyhood* and *Birdman*. It seems likely that a split will happen, but whether that means it's Inirritu/*Boyhood* winning or Linklater/*Birdman* is anyone's guess. The confusion could easily split the split, with either director and his film both winning. It's all too close. My guess is a double Linklater win (director and picture).

**Best Lead Actor** - Keaton to win. He's playing a washed up actor who in real life is making a comeback - it's like wish fulfillment for a big chunk of the voters, plus everyone likes Keaton. Eddie Redmayne was great, but he's young and I'm guessing people will wait to nominate him and vote for him for a future role.

**Best Actress** - Julianne Moore. Again, she's incredibly likeable and well-respected. Does both big blockbusters like *Mockingjay* and small indies so she's good for art and business, plus she's playing a disability. I think she's got this one in the bag.

**Best Supporting Actor/Actress** - The biggest sure bets of the night. Simmons and Arquette all the way. Either of them losing would not be an upset, but a complete shock that would make up 80% of the Oscar coverage tomorrow.

**Original Screenplay** - *The Grand Budapest Hotel*. This will be one Wes Anderson's consolation prize for one of the most nominated films this year. I'm also picking it for **Best Costume** and **Production Design**.

**Best Adapted Screenplay** - *Whiplash*. Lots of great zingers, very economically paced movie. Traditional in structure, but still a surprising third act (the end of the second act felt like the end of the picture - I was really wondering what they could add at that point, but the came up with a pretty great ending).

**Best Documentary** - *Citizenfour*. History in the making that feels like a thriller. It's an important issue that gets tons of coverage these days and this is showing you exactly when that dam breaks. 

**Best Foreign Language Film** - I haven't seen any but *Ida*, and the general consensus is that it's either that or *Leviathan*, so I'll go ahead and pick *Ida* for **Foreign** and for **Cinematography**. The black and white was beautifully rich and varied, and the compositions were lovely.

**Best Animated Feature** - Again I only saw one - *Big Hero Six* and it was decent, but not mind-blowing. I'll go with *How to Train Your Dragon 2* based solely on its momentum going in to the awards.

**Best Original Score** - Desplat might cancel himself out, Zimmer was ripping of *Koyannisqqatsi*. I'm guessing *The Theory of Everything* for the win. It was the most ""scorey"" score- it was a little more in-your-face and not particularly innovative, but it served the film that type of film well, and was pleasant enough, plus with all the noms, I don't think *Theory* will be totally shut out - a very slight consolation prize for them.

**Sound Editing** - *American Sniper*, **Sound Mixing** - *Whiplash*. Bullets whizzing by and jazz music. Look, I don't understand the subtleties of these any more than most of the people voting, so I'm guessing they will vote similarly.

**Best Song** - ""Glory"" from *Selma*. The anachronistic rap parts felt wrong for this film, but (this is going to sound terrible) but after all the racism criticism lobbed at the Academy, they will probably want to give *Selma* something, and since it's either that or ""Everything is Awesome"" (which will seem really trivial in comparison to the anthem from the important civil rights film, no matter how much people bitch about *The Lego Movie* snub), ""Glory"" will get this one.

**Best Visual Effects** - *Dawn* or *Rise* or *Whatever the Hell That Last Planet of the Apes* film was called. The voters are older. Even an eighty year old voter knows the *Apes* franchise, since it premiered back when he/she was in their thirties and still going to movies a lot. Plus, dammit those apes looked great. It was effects work with real emotion. Special effects rarely make people feel anything but awe, so I feel this work will really emotionally resound with the most people. Plus it is really incredible, deserving work.    

**Best Hair/ Make-up** - *Guardians of the Galaxy*. They will probably like to award a commercial big money maker, the make-up did look good and it was a huge job compared to some of the other nominees.  

shit, I cannot believe I have to make an edit to my post for this but:

**Best Editing** - Uh, *Boyhood*. The arguments lots of people have made about culling the footage and the smoothness of the transitions has me convinced. I dunno, it still felt a half hour too long and I wouldn't mind *Whiplash* winning, but am going for *Boyhood*.

If you legitimately think that Beyonce is not the most Commercial artist nominated for that category, you're fucking insane.

What's interesting is when you say that there is a lot of emotion in emo.  There certainly is, but is it the emotion itself that makes emo what it is?  My idea is that it has to do more with the overall sound of the piece, which also overlaps a lot with the ""indie"" sound — *relatively* soft pianos, guitars, and strings combined with a very specific type of vocal delivery, which I am going to attempt to describe as best as I can.  It's kind of an affectation where the vocalists, instead of trying to do a faux-British accent that doesn't pronounce R sounds at the end of words, instead overexaggerate the R and L sounds making a very, very North-American-sounding accent.  Which is not a bad thing in itself, but when I hear this specific kind of accent in many forms of music, with a similar kind of aesthetic in each song, the whole thing starts feeling gimmicky and I feel like the artists aren't fully being themselves (whether they know it or not.)  It's not too different from country artists all over the country adopting a specific Nashville accent to give that country ""feel"" to their music.  

Here are a few examples from mainstream music — most of these aren't emo, but they have that indie sound.  ""Fireflies"" by Owl City, ""A Lack of Color"" by Death Cab for Cutie, ""Everybody"" by Ingrid Michaelson.  ""Rory"" was probably my favorite part of *The Albatross*, possibly because the beginning of it sounded like Animal Collective (AnCo vocalists also have this affectation, though their music has such a strong psychedelic and experimental aspect that I pretty much never think of emo when I listen to them.)  

As for ""Vacation Bible Schools"", unfortunately I just can't bring myself to like this one.  The vocals annoy me, and the video also feels kind of gimmicky to me — I don't mean to offend, but it feels like just a mix of the stereotypical ""hipster"" aesthetic and the ""totally random"" aesthetic, which are both gimmicky in by book.  The annoying thing about it is that they have very intricate math rock guitar riffs, but the vocals distract me from it.  I'm not against grating vocals if I'm listening to grindcore, but I have trouble stomaching them in this kind of music.  

""Knife-Throwing Academy"" didn't leave much of an impression on me, good or bad.  ""Work"" was excellent, though.  The contrast of rapping and singing, male and female vocals, actually worked really well I think.  

I'm just casually browsing Breath of an Epoch and there are certain bits that I like a lot, like the drums on ""Dappity"".  

Again, thanks for the recommendations.  I don't know if this is a style of music that I will really fully ""get"", but I think with time, some aspects of this music will begin to grow on me.  Out of all the stuff you showed me, ""Work"" stood out to me as the best track.",,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,t3_2tfxdv,,,False,,,,t1_cnz1msz,,,,1422071321.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1424425716.0,,,

Here's why: Sure, movies like Gone Girl and Nightcrawler and The Lego Movie got snubbed hard. But, if we're being honest with ourselves, they only got snubbed in the categories they didn't have a chance of winning anyway. I think an Oscar Win says a lot more about a film than a nomination, and in (almost) every category the film that deserves to **win** (in my opinion, which I would dare to assume a lot of people agree with) probably will. Some examples:

**Best Picture**

Yeah, everyone's sad that Gone Girl and Nightcrawler didn't get nominated, and American Sniper did. So am I (despite not having seen Amiercan Sniper... and I'm guessing most of the people in this comments section haven't either, as it doesn't go into wide release until tonight). But come on, none of those three films had a single chance of beating out Boyhood, Birdman, Whiplash, or Selma. 

**Best Director**

This might be the closest thing to a ""snub"" in my opinion, as Fincher absolutely deserves to be nominated and might even be a strong contestant for the win. But here's the thing: Fincher's a world-renowned director. Everybody knows that. He knows that. Nobody's career is being ruined by snubbing him the 8th time he's made an amazing film. Wes Anderson is the only ""household"" name on this list and he's never been nominated (partly because, IMO, this is his best work yet). Linklater has been around for a while but has never made anything even remotely close to Boyhood in ambition or scope. Inarritu and Miller are both relatively unknown directors who both made surprisignly amazing films this year, and I would be happy if either of them won. So if you're angry about Fincher getting snubbed, tell me this: who would you cut from this list? My answer would be Morten Tyldum, because I wasn't crazy about The Imitation Game, but everybody else seemed to love it so I must be in the minority. 

**Best Actor**

Again, snub for Gyllenhaal. Cooper is blowing somebody at the Oscars, sure. But Gyllenhaal is no stranger to taking bizarre roles in smaller, darker indie films and not getting any Academy recognition for it. And, again, does anyone here *honestly* believe he would have beaten out Cumberbatch or Keaton or Redmayne or Carell? Yeah, he deserved to get nominated, but only over *one* other person on the list. I'm sure he would have been the #6 spot if that had been allowed. 

**Best Actress**

I'm fine with this list, and it seems like everyone else is too.

**Best Original Screenplay**

Honestly, I think this category is perfect, I can't imagine who I would have nominated over these five.

**Best Adapted Screenplay**

Okay, I take it back, this is the only major category that *really* deserves getting up in arms about. I haven't seen Inherent Vice, I hear it's rather boring but it's a PTA film so I have no doubt that the screenplay was amazing. How American Sniper was nominated over Gone Girl blows my mind, as I think the race was clearly between GG and Whiplash. My only explanation is that GG came out months ago and American Sniper is still fresh on everyone's minds, which in addition to the Oscar Power of Eastwood may explain its abundance of nominations. 

**Best Animated Feature**

I loved The Lego Movie as much as anyone else. But let's face it, most of its appeal came from dumb fun and comedy and nostalgia. From a purely critical standpoint it's not better than any of the other films on this list. 

While I agree that a lot of the nominations are probably influenced by ""politics,"" I don't think it's as big of a deal as everyone else here. No, American Sniper didn't get nominated because the Academy is conspiring against David Fincher and Dan Gilroy, or because Clint Eastwood is part of the Illuminati, or anything like that. It's because the Academy is filled with the kind of people who, when given the choice between a perfectly decent, patriotic Clint Eastwood war film an a wonderful-but-bizarre psychological thriller by an unknown director or an incredibly long murder mystery filled with techno music, they'll pick the Eastwood film every time. I'm not sure why it's taken 25 years for people to realize that. 

EDIT: 
After reading through these comments again, I find it absolutely hilarious that everyone's crying racism because Selma *only* got a Best Motion Picture nomination... when a film titled 12 Years a Slave fucking **WON** last year. Seriously, guys. Last year 12YaS only won because of PC White Guilt, this year the Academy are a bunch of racist white assholes. Pick one.

&gt;The __[Grammy Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award) for Album of the Year__ is presented by the [National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academy_of_Recording_Arts_and_Sciences) of the United States to ""honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position.""  Album of the Year is the most prestigious and final award category at the Grammys having been presented since [1959](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Grammy_Awards). Although it was originally presented to the artist alone, the award is now presented to the main artist, the featured artist(s), the producer, the engineer and/or mixer and the mastering engineer. In [1962](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards_of_1962), the award name was extended to __Album of the Year (other than classical)__ but, in [1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards_of_1965), the shorter name returned. It was not until [1968](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards_of_1968), [1969](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards_of_1969), [1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/41st_Grammy_Awards), [2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/53rd_Grammy_Awards), and [2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/56th_Grammy_Awards) that the award was won by a rock, [country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music), [hip hop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music), [indie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_music), or [electronic music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music) album respectively. As of [2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/54th_Grammy_Awards), classical albums are eligible for this award, with the award for [Best Classical Album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Classical_Album) being discontinued.

I currently play piano, bass (electric and stand up), acoustic and electric guitar, tenor sax, c-melody sax, drum kit. I write, arrange, and mix my own music. Im a photographer. I write short stories and screenplays (for personal enjoyment of course). I am a sound designer for a small indie game developer. I love all kinds of music except for country and anything that is played on the radio (basically all pop music and pop rap and pop hiphop). I love watching fantasy and scifi movies as well as every single Coen Brothers films, thrillers, war flicks, and the occasional Jackass if im feeling down. Reading is one of my absolute favorite things to do. I bought almost all of the newly published books sold at barns and noble (the stuff by Dante, EA Poe, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Brothers Grimm, H. P. Lovecraft) and a few other ones.

Almost everyone has at least one thing they are very good at. I havent found mine yet, but im trying to make it be tying knots. A bit weird right? Knots? Knots. Those odd, pointless on the surface but actually briliantly useful tools everybody should know.

I haven't done many of these, but when I see announcements of events/new facilities I file it away for future date night ideas, so...

* plays, musicals, indie theatre, modern dance
* Universities usually have tons of free/cheap events (e.g. student recitals, lectures, sports, etc.)
* music festivals e.g. Winterfolk, Wavelength
* second-run/art theatres (e.g. Bell Lightbox, Bloor cinema in Toronto)
* specialty museums (e.g. Air and Space museum, ceramics museum, Design Exchange, Bata shoe museum, textile museum, MOCCA, ...)
* art events (e.g. Come Up To My Room)
* one-night cooking class
* used bookstores
* brewery tour; beer tasting; some restaurants/brewpubs offer special dinners with beer pairings
* science centre
* specialty bars, e.g. rooftop bars, ice bars; there's a bar in Toronto with an collection of free vintage arcade games (Get Well); pubs with trivia nights, story-telling nights
* glass-blowing workshop
* Toronto has indoor gyms for trampolining, parkour, obstacle courses, rock climbing, hatchet throwing, beach volleyball, etc.  Places like these sometimes offer introductory lessons/passes.
* Also Toronto: billiards (Academy of Spherical Arts), ping pong (SPiN), etc. 
* dance lessons
* explore underground trail networks (e.g. PATH in Toronto)
* pubs with special event nights: burlesque, story-telling, 
* go to a country bar and ride a mechanical bull, go line dancing
* indoor market (e.g. St Lawrence market) and cook dinner together
* skydiving tunnel
* Toronto has a flight simulator place with a 777 cockpit.
* gallery openings, music release parties
* botanical gardens with a greenhouse e.g. Allan Gardens
* look on meetup.com for interesting upcoming events

Also, if you're in a metropolitan area, there are apps you can get to skim through special event listings.  E.g. blogto, NOW magazine, etc. for Toronto.

A lot of big indie/punk bands have came out of Buffalo over the past few years (Lemuria,Everytime I Die, the Mallwalkers). It's the kind of place where you can meet Steve Albini im a church basement or attend an art show for the Screaming Females lead singer Marissa. Last call is 4 am and there is bars everywhere so it's easy to find a show. Allentown is basically a mini-Williansburg, Brooklyn and Elmwood Avenue is full of small little boutique shops ( anchored by Buffalo State College and the Albright Knox). If you can't find a show going on in a bar or art space, there is probably one happening in a house or basement. In the summer there are free concerts down at Canalside for Rock the Harbor and in Lewiston at Artpark.

Art galleries everywhere, we have the Albright Knox and Hallwalls (which are major institutions in the Contemporary Art World), a long with smallee galleries and creative spaces all across the city. Sugar City, Big Orbit Gallery, Squeaky Wheel Media Center and the WNY Creative Writing Center are just a few of them.

The city is basically now a big college town. We have 8 different schools inside just the city limits (not counting places like Niagara University twenty minutes away). The University of Buffalo has three seperate campuses and is considered the crown jewel of the SUNY system. It also has the third highest amount of international students in the country for a University (correct if I am wrong on this, it might of changed).

We are leading the country right now in preservation of old historic buildings, turning around the urban decay that's plaguing places like Detroit. In the past few years, the Frank Loyd Wright designed Darwin Martin House (his first big work) was saved, the Lafayette Hotel (designed by the country's first woman architect) was renovated, the Statler Tower and H.R. Richardson complex are being worked on. Buffalo is one of the few cities in the US to have buildings designed by the big three 20th century architects (Frank Loyd Wright, Louis Sullivan, H.R. Richardson). We have hosted several national architectural and preservation events over the past few years. On top of that, old industrial sites like Silo City are being repurposed as living muesuems and art spaces. Look up the City of Night event, it's basically a huge party (with music, light shows, sculptures, flame dancers and so on) for the city that's held on the Silo City site. The city is full of beautiful victorian mansions, other areas are still pretty bad, but a tremendous amount of work is being put in to fix them up. We also have a History museum (that's housed in a building built for the Pan Am Expo), Teddy Roosevelt Inauguration site, science museum (that hosts events like the Body Works exhibit, where human bodies are preserved in a plastic material). The region also has a deep connection with Nikola Tesla due to Niagara Falls. Buffalo is called the City of Lights because it was the first city to be totally powered by electricity.


We have several different breweries here, from Resurgence Brewery on Niagara Street to Flying Bison and Pearl Street Brewery. The oldest operating Bavarian Beer Hall in Germany just announced that they are opening a Buffalo location this summer. Most of the bars carry a huge variety of craft beer, the Blue Monk alone would make any beer lover happy.

Terry Pegula is building a $125 million dollar hockey complex down by the harbor that will be attached to the Buffalo Sabres arena, house two more professional sized ice rinks, a state of the art fitness facility, a world class hockey academy and a 16 floor hotel. Elon Musk from Space X and Tesla Motors is building the western hemispheres biggest solar panel factory down on the Buffalo river (and unlike the South Western states, he came to us, not the other way around). Over 16.6 billion dollars in development is happening around the region right now.

That's not to mention that the city sits on the shore of Lake Erie, is right next to Niagara Falls along with being an hour and a half away from Toronto. There is a huge amount of cross over between Buffalo and Toronto, it's not uncommon for Canadians to be at our concerts or festivals (Taste of Buffalo and International Chicken Wing Festival). This is stuff that I can think of off the top of my head. There is a reason why Buffalo has been getting compared to Austin, TX, Portland,OR and Seattle so much recently. New York City just announced a joint tourism partnership with Buffalo based off of all the cultural attractions we have to offer. The New York Times just reported that Buffalo is ranked as one of the fastest growing cities for newly graduated college students, beating out many of the top American Metropolitan areas.

I love New York state, especially Rochester, Albany and Syracuse but in all seriousness, they don't have nearly as much stuff to offer people as Buffalo does. For some reason people still have it stuck in their heads that the city is a bygone, depressed, sore loser town which couldn't be further from the truth. Buffalo is making a major come back on the National stage right now and is setting the example on how to revive the old Rust Belt industrial city. We are starting to come into the same position Seattle was in right before the early 90's explosion.

Amoeba Records in Los Angeles - Huge selection of new releases, used vinyl of all genres, posters, shirts, rare records, cds, dvds, etc. 

Rasputin Records in Berkley - I have heard great thigns

Minnesota: 

Electric Fetus - Large, well curated selection of new vinyl, decent selection of used vinyl. Smattering of other merchandise.

NYC:

Other Music - Great spot for new indie records. Decent selection of used. 

The Thing - Brooklyn - Huge collection of dusty records for a dollar each. Best spot for digging in the city.

Turntable Lab - Great spot for hip hop, electronic, and trendy genres. 

Academy Records - Brooklyn / Manhattan - Best for old records. Well organized, well stocked, but you're not gonna find a steal. They know how to price their vinyl.

In no particular order, I'd add:  

Minutemen - Double Nickels on the Dime (rhythm, bass as lead with listenable complex structures and lines, beauty)  
fIREHOSE - Ragin' full on (same, but pushed into a more standard post punk rock form)  
Throwing Muses - House Tornado  (beautiful ideas about walking lines in the middle of songs, pulling something really different out of post punk songs)  
Three Mile Pilot - Na Vucca do Lupu (if Stanley Clark played alternative music with just bass, drums, and the bass carried the entire song)  
The Stranglers -- Rattus Norvegicus (amazing tone and driving force in songs - similar to NoMeansNo for bass tone)  
Tortoise - Self Titled (great tone, great instrumental structures, multiple basses playing well)  
Codeine - Barely Real (bass can be played slow and well and deliberate and make different uses of space)  
Van Morrison - Astral Weeks (transformational ideas about pop songs and structures - for upright bass in pop music)  

Songs to check out for similar reasons:  

Drive Like Jehu (Do you Compute - once the guitars have you expecting a certain idea, the bass comes in and completely overrides the suggested thinking about where the rhythm will be)  
Bastro (Diablo Guapo)  
Mission of Burma (Peking Spring and Academy Fight song - driving, tone, stops and starts)  
Unrest (June - beautiful and much more liberated -- the bass can be really flexible about where it lands and still lead the song)  
Bow Wow Wow (Go Wild in the Country -- what a freaking bass line!)  
Les Claypool with Tom Waits (Hang on St. Christopher, the Earth Died Screaming - electric upright in waltzes and marches-ish)  
Captain Beefheart (My Human Gets Me Blues, Steal Softly Through Sunshine, Frownland - what these songs are able to do - did - in the late 60s is incredible - dense and deep.  Early detuning, chords, among other interesting ideas)  
The Jam (Eaton Rifles, Town Called Malice - more great driving lines and tones)  
Pere Ubu (The Modern Dance - tone, stop start, chords.)  
Goz of Kermeur (Ringing on - upright bass as lead in swiss indie rock from the late 80s/ 90s)  
The Ex (Frenzy - bass that intersects with dueling rhythm baritones - simple lines that drive.)  

All of these recordings, songs and albums, contribute to the body of knowledge and thought about what we do.  Whether knowing about these ideas and approaches is good to model for training the fingers, hands, ears, or whether to avoid it (or as Truman's Water suggested -- the only reason to know anything about music is to use it against itself), these are some pretty great thinkers and players.  Mike Watt alone is heavily responsible for a lot of later players (Flea, Claypool, etc).  

I hope you find something in there you didn't know about.  I like these threads because, although there are usually popular things that everyone knows, there are also new things I learn about - especially as an american -- there are lots of things that it is impossible to know about here if you don't know someone who knows (well, I don't live on the coasts, so not much comes inland this far - maybe you guys and gals are luckier?).",,,0.0,acoustic,,,,,,,,,,,,t3_2hmgzs,,,False,,,,t1_ckv4ucp,,,,1411948801.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1426777273.0,,,

t5_2qhp7,,,,False,,,1.0,,,,urbanplanning,,,,,,cjyybrj,,,0,True,,,ltristain,,,t3_2e8aii,1,,,,,,"As a baseline, a livable city should be safe and clean.

Beyond that, a city should provide its people with *freedom*. And this means making as many things people need to live and like to do as easy as possible, so that no matter who you are and what kind of life you desire (within reason), chances are you can find that somewhere in the city.

For example, multi-modal transportation is a huge factor that makes cities more livable because it offers a myriad of choices to how people can get around. If you want to drive, you can drive. If you want to bike, you can bike. If you want to take the bus, you can take the bus. If you want to take the subway, you can take the subway. If you want to take the ferry, you can take the ferry. If you want to take a taxi, you can take a taxi. You want to leave the city by boat, you have access to a good harbor. You want to leave the city by train, you have access to a great train station. You want to leave the city by plane, you have access to a major airport. Most importantly, all of these options are sufficiently supported to make them sufficiently competitive with others so that none of them are false choices (choices that suck so much that they're actually never acceptable choices).

Another example, the most livable city would be a city with foot traffic and stores open all 24 hours around the clock. If you work a regular day shift, the city is convenient for you. If you work an evening shift, the city is convenient for you. If you work a night shift, the city is convenient for you. If you're a student and have nonregular wake-sleep schedules, the city is convenient for you. If you're traveling at odd hours, the city is convenient for you. Of course in reality you can't expect an equal level of service during prime time versus 3AM in the morning, but the 3AM option has to be meet at least some baseline level to make the lifestyle that requires it workable.

Another example, the most livable city would have an incredibly diverse economy supporting an incredible diverse amount of jobs, as well as a large and diverse population to support an incredibly diverse amount of businesses. If you're a dancer, you can find a way to make a living. If you're an artist, you can find a way to make a living. If you're a programmer, you can find a way to make a living. If you're a cook, you can find a way to make a living. If you're a rollerblader, you can find a way to make a living. If you're a flower arranger, you can find a way to make a living. I would imagine in the far future with vertical farms (if that ever happens), even farmers would be able to find a way to make a living.

Then there's social and cultural diversity. If you're a teenager, you should have no trouble finding others like you. If you're a 20-something, you should have no trouble finding others like you. If you're a 40-year old parent, you should have no trouble finding others like you. If you're a retired old dude or lady, you should have no trouble finding others like you. If you're a family of 20, you should be able to find something that works for you. If you're from a particular foreign country and can't speak the local language well, you should have no trouble finding others like you. If you're a gen 1.5 immigrant, you should have no trouble finding others like you. If you're a third culture kid who plays the banjo, you should have no trouble finding others like you. If you're a minimum wage worker night owl, you should have no trouble finding others like you. If you're a genius billionaire playboy philanthropist, you should have no trouble finding others like you.

If you like open spaces, there should be plenty of that to satisfy you. If you like narrow streets surrounded by tall buildings, there should be plenty of that to satisfy you. If you like postmodern architecture, there should be plenty of that to satisfy you. If you like classic victorians, there should be plenty of that to satisfy you. If you like bridges, there should be plenty of bridges. If you like hills, there should be plenty of hills. If you like flat areas, there should be plenty of flat areas. If you like suburbs with big yards, the city should have suburbs you can live in. If you like Hong Kong-esque highrises, the city should have highrise residential districts you can live in. If you want privacy and isolation, you should be able to have that. If you want street noise and vibrant living spaces, you should be able to have that.

If you mainly buy stuff online, you should be able to do that (perhaps with great ISPs in the city). If you want to buy something in a store, you should be able to get to one easily no matter how obscure that thing is (and yes, this includes physical books... it's sad that bookstores are getting pushed out by Amazon). If you want to go to school, there should be one available to you regardless of what kind - elementary, high school, city college, full university campus, art college, film school, music academy, etc... If you want to learn a skill, there should be places providing classes and training that you have easy access to. If you want to enjoy any form of art whether it be beatbox artists on the street, or indie musicians playing small shows, or improv in a comedy club, or wall murals in a neighborhood, or high class michelin starred food art, or video game music concerts performed by full orchestras complete with figure skating performances, or public displays of human acrobatics, you should have access to it, somehow.

Then there's the environment, which a city really can't control, but does impact the city's livability. If you want to surf at a beach, there should be one close by. If you want to go camp in a forest or on a mountain, there should be one close by. If you want to go ride horses on plains, there should be a place for that close by. If you want sunny beach weather, there should be plenty of those for you. If you like the melancholy of drizzling rain or the explosive release of a thunderstorm, those should happen frequently enough for you. If you like the peacefulness and coziness of snow outside, it should happen frequently enough for you.

If you like the sun, you should have access to it, *but if you like the shade, you should ALSO have access to it* (and this is why building shadows aren't always a bad thing).

You want to throw away garbage, there should be a garbage bin close by. You want to buy snacks, there should be a snack provider (hot dog stand, convenience store, etc...) close by. You're tired of walking, there should be a transit stop close by. You want to sit down somewhere, there should be benches nearby. You need to go use the bathroom, there should be bathrooms open to public nearby. You want to get a drink, there should be water fountains nearby. You want to cross a major street, that should be easy, not hard. You're temporarily homeless and need a place to sleep, there should be something for you to use.

But most importantly, all of these should be distributed in such a way so that you can want any combination of the above, and still be able to get them all somewhere, and all of these should be relatively affordable to you regardless of how poor you are (within reason).

Of course, it's impossible for a city to achieve all that, but some cities are better at it than others, and I would consider the cities that are better at it the more livable ones.",,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,t3_2e8aii,,,False,,,,t1_cjyybrj,,,,1408862563.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1427384844.0,,,

From what I've heard, avoid any of the ""trendy"" named student letting agents (houzzz, homez, etc) as they have a bit of a reputation for being a nightmare to deal with! Might be worth looking/posting on the various uni Facebook pages for both Leicester uni and DMU, but if you live with students you'll be paying 75% council tax, compared to say 25% if you shared with three professionals and split it. In terms of areas, Clarendon Park in LE2 is a big student /young professionals area, quite trendy and pretty nice, my girlfriend lived there for two years, though you will have slightly higher crime rates because of all the students. Highfields and bits along Narborough Road have a reputation for being a bit dodgy, but I've not really been there much, they might be fine! 
In terms of music, personally I've found Leicester a bit crap, but then I come from living near Leeds and York, so I think I've been a bit spoilt! Neither uni at has a music degree, as far as I know, so I've found most of the music tends to be teenagers in shitty indie bands or middle aged blokes doing pub rock. There is the o2 academy which gets some big-ish bands in, and the council seem to be trying to push for more music, theres a couple of festivals / events this summer. Embrace arts (run by Leicester uni) has some decent jazz on relatively regularly, and the cookie on high cross Street has had a couple of good gigs on when I've been.

Probably [Summer in Fairbrook](http://vndb.org/v5608), even though I thought it was rather challenging. I appreciated how the game compels the main character to befriend everyone.

Since you want to create your own interactive story, Laiktail, you might benefit by reading the TVTropes article [So You Want to Make a Visual Novel](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SoYouWantTo/MakeAVisualNovel). The site has other useful articles, but beware: it can be a serious time sink. Other things I recommend:

* Becoming active on [Lemma Soft](http://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/index.php), [r/vndevs](http://www.reddit.com/r/vndevs), and looking through the [EVN developer list](http://tinyurl.com/vn-devs-doc) of active projects
* Thinking about your project's scope. Don't plan to write more than you can handle.
* Ask yourself ""How will this story end?"" and ""Is there a pivotal scene that can be the centerpiece of the story?""
* Give yourself a deadline. This will help keep you on task, and help prevent the project from going on infinite hiatus.
* Be sure to ask for any assistance if you have trouble with writing or finding bugs. If you can pay people to create art or music or a GUI, that will help.

If you ask me, ""OELVN"" seems to be a disparaging term. It's also a ridiculous acronym if you ask me. The term seems to have been borrowed from anime-manga fandom. Comics written in English with an art style vaguely similar to recent anime-manga aesthetics were called [OEL manga](http://manga.about.com/od/typesofmanga/p/OELmangaintro.htm) back in the 2000s. There is a mentality in anime, manga, and translated games fandom of ""anything that seems to be an imitation is inferior to an original product."" I've had this attitude at times. In the recent past, I was awfully snobby about translated pop culture media, including merchandise-driven anime series, manga that started out well but which ended poorly, and translated video games which had a frustrating lack of original ideas. I can say from firsthand experience that a ""no imitations welcome"" attitude is not positive or helpful.

I'm a fan of visual novels written in English. If I am forced to use an acronym to describe them, then maybe I'll use ""EVN."" If there's a relatively distinct art style,  such as [Elements: The Academy](http://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?f=43&amp;t=13309) or [Cinders](http://lemmasoft.renai.us/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=15781), then maybe I'll use ""WVN.""",,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,t3_2b7fkw,,,False,,,,t1_cj2jkgn,,,,1405865282.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1434805781.0,,,

 [**Perfume (Japanese band)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfume%20(Japanese%20band\)): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Perfume__ (パフューム ?) is a [Japanese pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J-pop) [girl group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_group) from [Hiroshima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima), Japan, consisting of [Ayano Ōmoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayano_%C5%8Cmoto), [Yuka Kashino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuka_Kashino), and [Ayaka Nishiwaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayaka_Nishiwaki). The group has been signed with [Universal Music Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Music_Group) since 2012.

&gt;The group was formed in early 2000 inside young talent academy *Actors School Hiroshima*, and debuted with their first Hiroshima-local single ""[Omajinai Perori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omajinai_Perori)"" released on March 21, 2002. A year later they moved to Tokyo, started to work with [Yasutaka Nakata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasutaka_Nakata) and released their first nationwide indie single, ""[Sweet Donuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Donuts)"" on August 6, 2003. In 2005 they got a major contract deal with Tokuma Japan Communications, and released their major debut single ""[Linear Motor Girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_Motor_Girl)"" on September 21. However, it was not until 2008 where the group's seventh single ""[Polyrhythm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyrhythm_(song\))"", which was chosen to be the theme song of a recycle campaign by [NHK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHK), when they started to receive major attention in Japan. The single peaked at number seven on the Oricon charts, becoming their first Top 10 single in Japan, and since then, all of their subsequent works starting with their eighth single ""[Baby Cruising Love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Cruising_Love)"" have debuted within the Top 3 of the charts. Their first original studio album, *[Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_(Perfume_album\))*, released on April 16, 2008, became their first number one album in Japan, and ""[Love the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_the_World)"", released on July 9, 2009, their first number one single. With rough combined sales of both singles and albums, the group have sold over 3 million records, with 1.5 million albums sold in Japan alone as of March 2012. 

&gt;The group were formed with an original post-[Shibuya-kei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibuya-kei) sound as it was popular during the years until their transition toward contemporary [electronic dance music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_dance_music) that incorporated elements of [synthpop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthpop), [bubblegum pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubblegum_pop), [dance-pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance-pop) and [house music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music). The group is also known for their processed vocals, heavily using [autotune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotune) and [vocoders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocoder). Over the years, Perfume have been one of the most successful acts in Asian music. The group's musical structure have been identified as ""techno-pop"". In 2012 the group announced that they had signed a global contract with [Universal Music Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Music_Group),  and that they expected to expand their horizons and ""go global"". Their sixteenth major label single ""[Spending All My Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spending_All_My_Time)"", released on August 15, 2012, was seen as a dedication to fans overseas.   Their fourth studio album *[Level3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level3_(album\))* was released on October 2, 2013, and was soon followed by the single ""[Sweet Refrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Refrain)"" a month after.

so when i was 10, infinity on high had dropped and thnks fr th mmrs was getting signifcant radio play - funny enough, i was on an airplane (pre-ipod) and only had the seatside headphone jack to plug into, where the top 40 station was playing - you guessed it - that sublime orchestral pop punk shit.

keep in mind, i'd grown up in asia for a majority of my childhood. i had no parental musical canon like the beatles or any of that. i grew up with kpop and didn't really like or get music. i got home from that flight and looked up fall out boy where i immediately fell in love with the band ~~and proceeded to let pete wentz entirely ruin my grammar and my adolescence.~~ after fall out boy it was panic at the disco, cobra starship, the academy is, paramore - that progression of fueled by ramen bands. it was the golden era of fbr right before pretty. odd. came out and everything fell to shit. i found my chemical romance, the used, as well as some more ""modern"" pop punk bands. my friends introduced me to motion city soundtrack and say anything.

(sidebar: in 2006 i was added on myspace by all time low right after they had put out the video for six feet under. i laughed, downloaded the track and promptly forgot about them for like four years until nothing personal came out and literally every god damn tween girl quoted weightless on their facebook status. then i laughed some more and then proceeded to regret my entire life.)

around 2008 i stopped listening to pop punk as much because somebody introduced me to indie rock. then somebody recommended the maine to me, which introduced me back into that headfirst spiral in to *pop* punk. i quickly found all time low's new material, the summer set, versaemerge. somewhere in there, pete wentz started promoting four year strong and i found it enjoyable, but never delved much further.

then my friend mark introduced me to the upsides as it was released. it changed my entire fucking perspective on pop punk. this is so disgustingly cliche but the album honestly helped me get over how much freshman year of high school was killing my soul and reminded me that above all, i had my friends and i had my music. i listened to suburbia and basically knew that this genre had me by the fucking jugular at this point. now i'm listening to citizen, real friends, brand new, tonight alive, the early november, fireworks - you guys can probably guess the list better than i can rattle it off.

i love pop punk. it's kind of fucking awful, especially when people ask me what bands i like. i love pop punk because i can relate to the lyrics and it's not about the things i don't care about or can't relate to. i love the scene and how close knit everyone is. i love the instrumentation of pop punk and the diy aesthetic. i love that pretense and bravado is rejected, unlike punk or hardcore. i couldn't imagine going a week without at least hearing one track off of suburbia and completely relating in that moment.

tl;dr it's basically been my musical canon since ten and i don't even know how to listen to anything else anymore 'lol'",,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,t3_25ufr2,,,False,,,,t1_chkwn6n,,,,1400406145.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1433847216.0,,,

Generation Records and Bleeker St Records down by NYU are the obvious ones, and they have fantastic punk collections which is why I hit them up all the time. Academy Records carries all the over old or different stuff I'm into: it's got Phillip Glass, Coltrane, Armstrong, the works. Fifth Avenue Records is great for used stuff and classic rock stuff, and Other Music has mostly indie in terms of new music and supports the local artists too.

Can't recommend those stores enough in terms of staff either; great service every time I go and always have the releases ready for me, once you build a relationship with them they're super helpful and know your name

i'd start it at 2pm, the default time for elementary school birthday parties. gives everyone enough time to have a morning to themselves and not rush to get to your party, and isn't so late that it'll be cut short by some people's curfews. take it to midnight maybe, unless things get boring but that sounds like a good amount of people to keep it going

make invitations in photoshop or something

people that dont like soda probably won't like hawaiian punch either - throw in some fruit juices (apple, orange, grape) and just have water readily available.

pizza is good, pineapples are good too. not sure what else but that works.

best of luck

* Big star's third will be WELL worth seeing.  If this is the band that is currently touring, there is only one surviving member of Big Star (Jody Stevens) and this is a performance of the album Third/Sister's Lovers with the backing of an orchestra.    Along with Jody is a great lineup of studio musicians including Mike Mills from R.E.M. and Ken Stringfellow from the Posies.  I expect this to be packed.
* Gedeon Luke and the family band is soul music - think Robert Randolph without the steel pedal guitar - very good band
* you should know amy levere if you live in memphis.  Nora-jones-type petite brunet who is easy on the eyes playing a stand up bass.  She works at the flyer sometimes.
* cedric burnside is RL Burnside's grandson - I met him and his brother gary many times in my days running around the hill country blues scene and have seen him many times (a good friend of mine used to be their manager).  He's one of the most gifted natural musicians I've ever seen - expect a lot of hill country blues and rock.
* School of rock is just like it sounds - expect middle school and HS kids covering a lot of classic rock songs (it's actually pretty good)
* Lucero is of course a local band that has gained moderate success in the past few years.  I'm not crazy about them (I prefer the indie psychedelic local bands like Tiger High and the Trashed Romeos) but they have a good-sized following and tour often.
* Old 97s are an indie alt country act that gained a bit of success a few years back
* Stax music academy is awesome if you've never seen it - this is another after school deal like the school of rock but where they focus on Stax soul classics.
* Earphunk is a new orleans jam band - I've seen them with Galactic.  They're the kind of band you might see open up at tipitinas or the blue nile on a random Thursday night in the big easy.  If you're familiar with Galactic, dumpstaphunk, the meters, or the radiators then you have a good idea of what to expect (although I don't think they're in the same class as those bands).",,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,t3_22l4fg,,,False,,,,t1_cgox1jp,,,,1397136503.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1433293357.0,,,

I produce and direct, mostly fashion films and music videos to keep the rent up. I work on bigger productions in the production department (PC, PM, LP depending) and I occasionally work as Grip or a Light Tech. I've done work in almost every department except post and sound (i'm tone deaf).

I was a teenage runaway living in a warehouse that doubled as a punk venue when one of my older roommates got me hired on to PA a shoot he was working.  I loved it, but my flyover state didn't have a film industry, and I was really busy being a punk rock loser so I'd get driver or PA jobs a few times a year but never thought much about it.

When I was finishing up High School I hadn't considered filmschool. No one had told me it was an option. I think about 5 people from my class of 2,500 went to art school.  I aced the math section of my SATs and got mostly As so I applied to MIT and got in, but couldn't get enough grants to pay for it. And I didn't really want to go anyway.

I sold my car (which I had bought with the money form that first PA gig) and my records and basically everything and got a plane ticket to London because it wasn't anywhere near where I was and they spoke english. 

When I got to London I realized that the $350 I had left over was gonna go fast and I needed work. With my ahem questionable ahem eligibility to work I didn't have many options so I took a job as a bike messenger.

When you hang out with a bunch of young, working class dudes who have a bit of hustle and creativity, opportunities come your way. I got pulled onto a few shoots by other messengers who PAed on the side. And I started doing that as much as I could. For both the money and the love.

When a magazine became interested in some of my photography, they sorted out my visa issues for me and I was able to quit my messenger job. Which was awesome because I was getting really tired of being hit by cars. 

With a visa that allowed me to work on set as a freelancer I dove in and started working as a PA, grip, or spark. I was also building my photography up and hustling to make things happen. 

The photo thing kinda took off when a start up fashion magazine gave me their cover. I then got a few campaigns and an agent and an ego. I also got a lot of great experience running shit on set and learning as go. ""Yeah I will totally do an ad campaign for your car company""... googles: ""how to photograph cars"". 

I got crazy busy with the photo thing. I'd shoot editorial or campaigns all day and shoot fashion parties all night. I was 20 I go to know everyone and it was awesome.  Also my girlfriend who I was living with was film journalist so I was connected to that industry, altho I wasn't working on film sets.

Then a few things happened: The economy collapsed and my visa expired. The Queen wouldn't give me a new one and although I had lived in London for 4 years and it was my home I would have to leave.  I obviously wanted to keep working in fashion/ production and had to go to America so I could chose between NYC and LA.

Because I like winter and culture and hate traffic I chose NYC. I worked on set when I could as a PA or grip mostly, some times as a 2nd AC or juicer. I was also doing a few photo shoots and bar tending. 

I didn't know anyone living here so I started a street style blog as an excuse to talk to pretty girls. This meant I got really active on social media and learned how to use it effectively to market a brand.

After a few years of hustling I asked a fashion designer/ artist I really respect for a job and I asked again and again until he gave me one managing his store. My 3 day a week retail job quickly became full time, then 7 days a week with me in the office doing PR and social media for the brand Monday -Thursday and in the store Friday - Sunday. 

Two years in on this job and I had increased our sales 400% was doing all the PR for 5 lines, social media for 2 and doing events and pr for 3 fine artists. I was busy, but I missed being on set so I would volunteer on no budget shoots and do whatever.

Then I got a twitter DM from someone at Red Bull and they told me they where bringing a thing called the Red Bull Music Academy to New York and needed some one connected here to help with social media and production and they wanted it to be me. 

I worked on that project for a year as a freelancer and they where going to be doing a lot of live streaming and documentary films so I jumped on the chance to pitch in on those. People respected my hustle and organization so I started getting called to produce or LP indie projects and I loved it. But Red Bull was giving me a lot of money and I was giving them a lot of work.

I hired my team and we killed it on the music academy project. I was pumped on life but exhausted. I looked for more social media based projects and picked up a few but wasn't feeling it. Also I brought my best friend on as a partner and she stole from the business. 

Tired of that, and a bit burned on the marketing thing I thought ""what makes me happy, what makes me money?"" and it was production, photo and film stuff and running shit/ being a leader. So I said fuck it, I've got like 10 years of part time experience at this, I'm gonna do it.

Since August I've done 4 fashion films, 3 commercials, a few music videos and  a hand full of photo shoots as a producer / director / creative director. And I've been working on other peoples productions. Beyonce even asked to borrow my glasses on set once, you can see them on them on my buddy Shaun Ross in the Pretty Hurts video.

It depends a little on what you like. Are you a bit more into clubs and nightlife? Touristy stuff? Laid back hiking?

Palo Alto itself is about 30 miles south of San Francisco. If you're into hiking there's some pretty decent hikes here. Castle Rock Park is in the Santa Cruz Mountains, has lots of redwood trees and ferns, usually you can see deer, birds, other wildlife. Rancho San Antonio is also good for hiking although its more scrub oak chaparral than redwoods. Muir Woods north of the city has lots of redwoods, easy trails and is close to a small beach if you wants some more laid back hiking.

The city. For touristy stuff, I'd start in Union Square. Thats in the main shopping district, lots of designer clothes and jewelry, things like that. Union Square usually has big public things going on as well, stuff like dance exhibitions or art or, sometimes, protests. I was there a year or so ago and there was a big Palestinian rights protest going on. From Union Square one can take the famous cable car to Ghirardhelli Square. Famous chocolate company, lots of stuff there to see. Lots of little art galleries outside. Picasso, Chagall, stuff like that. They're small, you can look in twenty minutes or so. Kind of like a mini-art museum. From there its a pretty short walk along the waterfront to Fisherman's Wharf. Lots of seafood along the way. Usually street performers like they have in Venice Beach. Then you can take a cable car back from Fisherman's Wharf to Union Square. There is also the Golden Gate Bridge, lots of places will rent bikes that you can ride across on a nice day. From Fisherman's Wharf you can get tickets to visit Alcatraz. The Haight-Ashbury district was the famous hippie area and now has a lot of shop, vintage clothes, and food.

For clubs, there's a place in downtown around 10th and Folsom thats called the DNA Lounge. Two dance floors and they pump AC through the floor so you don't get quite as sweaty and nasty. usually have a DJ. Sometimes they'll have a live band playing mixups. Crazy on the weekends. Place called the Supper Club at 3rd and Harrison that also has a couple of dance floors. More techno / top 40. Another place called the bubble lounge at Jackson and Montgomery that's a champagne bar. usually a bit more upscale.

For more bars and music scene, I'd look at the Fillmore, the Great American Music Hall, Hotel Utah, or Bottom of the Hill. All four typically feature live music, usually rock or indie rock bands. If she's here on a Tuesday night, a club called PopScene plays new bands, typically from either the UK, Netherlands or France that are making their first appearance in the states. For kind of dive bars, there's a place called Amnesia in the Mission District or one called Grant and Green in the Marina that are usually chill and with entertaining people.

For breweries, there's the Anchor Brewery, 21st Amendment near AT&amp;T park, Speakeasy in Hunter's point, Southern Pacific Brewing on the edge of the Mission and the Rogue Ale House on Russian Hill.

For food, there is a lot of good Italian places along Columbus street in Little Italy. Lot of seafood along the Wharf between Ghirardelli and Fisherman's Wharf. Lots of trendier places in the Mission District, around 23rd and Valencia. Tons of small little places around the city. Great vegetarian restaurant called Greens at the Fort Mason Center, usually you'll need reservations. The food is good enough that you wouldn't notice it was vegetarian unless they told you. Some good local food places with awesome beers near the Armory on the Edge of the mission. Monk's Kettle or Abbot's Cellar have some great food on a rotating menu along with a great selection of beers.

Good comedy shows at a place called Cobb's or there is an improv comedy group called the Bay Area Theatre Society that performs at the Fort Mason Center. Couple of places that do live theater if you likes drama or Broadway.

For art or museum stuff, there is the De Young Museum of Fine Art in Golden Gate Park. Across the street there is the California Academy of Sciences. Lots of cool science exhibits if you're into that. On Thursday nights they do something called nightlife where they'll bring in DJs, performers, speakers and alcohol and let people come in late from like 7 pm to 11 pm. Learn something and meet someone new at the same time.",,,0.0,tomsula-aquateen2,,,,,,,,,,,,t3_20cldm,,,False,,,,t1_cg1xumv,,,,1394747731.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1432788837.0,,,

I turned 10 in 2000, so I was anywhere from 7-12 when they were very popular). I didn't know or like much else, really.

In high school, around age 14, I started hanging out with a few guys in bands and started to really find that emo/scene look very attractive so my favourite band was Panic! At the Disco, followed by Fall Out Boy, The Academy Is..., My Chemical Romance and whatnot. Some heavier stuff as well and general classic rock like Queen and Zeppelin, as well as The Beatles. I was one of those ""I like everything except for country and rap"" people from 13-16.

One of my best friends was very into more indie stuff so I listened to The Postal Service and Iron and Wine at those ages as well.

After high school, I got back into pop music (with less enjoyment out of boy bands. Hate One Direction and the Jonas Brothers) and then basically anything else. I will listen to and enjoy almost everything, with preferences still being classic rock and contemporary pop. Katy Perry and Lady Gaga are some of my favourites at the moment. Queen is always a favourite. I like some country (mostly stuff from my childhood, Garth Brooks, Brooks and Dunn, Shania Twain), and I absolutely love Eminem also. I don't listen to classical very much, but not because I don't like it, it's just not something I'm in the mood for very often. I don't love dubstep, but I don't hate it either. Basically I've learned that there's a time and a place for everything.

I still like the older Panic! music, but now that they aren't the original members (technically Jon wasn't original, but I consider him to be) I don't like the new stuff. Fall Out Boy I still LOVE, old and new. My Chemical Romance I still enjoy sometimes. Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears are still my jam.

**Edit:** The ""heavier stuff"" I spoke about in high school was Cannibal Corpse, Behemoth, and Slipknot, those types of things. I quite heavily dislike that music now, it's one of the only types I can think of that I don't like. It ""spoke"" to me as a teen, now it's just noise to my adult ears. I hate it.

- [Other Music](http://www.othermusic.com/): small store, but probably one of the best in the city.  Known for it's highly unique and very eclectic collection.  While they certainly have rock records, they skew towards indie rock, electronic, weirdo reissues, odd funk and African sounds, and the usual Pitchfork-style favorites.  Their weekly newsletter has really well-written reviews.  That staff is supremely intelligent here.
- [Generation Records](http://www.generationrecords.com/): Pretty large store, two floors.  Specializes in punk and metal.  Every time I've come in here, I've always heard something awesome playing in-store that I've never heard of before.  Also has a decent t-shirt/hoodie section downstairs in the back.  Very helpful and heavily tattooed staff.
- [Academy Records](http://www.academy-records.com/), [Academy East Village](http://www.academy-lps.com/), and [Academy Annex](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Academy-Record-Annex/281944916601): Academy is a large store in Flatiron off of 18th and 5th that's widely regarded as one of the best in the City.  They have a large collection of everything.  Probably best known for jazz and classical.  Their store in the East Village is more geared towards hip hop and punk.  My personal favorite, however is the Academy Annex (recently relocated from the heart of Williamsburg to Greenpoint).  Very large store with tons of records.  Lots of punk, metal, hip hop, electronic, funk, and jazz.
- [Black Gold Records](http://blackgoldbrooklyn.com/): Located in Carroll Gardens, this is probably the most unique on the list, and one of my personal favorites.  It's a coffee shop/antique store/record store.  The record selection is deceptively large, given the small size of the shop.  Furthermore, the selection is constantly turning over.  You never know what you're gonna find there.  I've found everything from Jazz to Death Metal.
- [Co-Op 87](http://coop87records.tumblr.com/): Another great shop in Greenpoint with a very well-curated and unique selection.  Has everything from punk and jazz to hip-hop and novelty comedy records.  I believe it's affiliated with the Captured Tracks label.
- [Permanent Records](http://www.permanentrecords.info/): Another great and well-curated shop in Greenpoint, specializing in indie and punk.  Really like this one too.
- [The Thing](https://plus.google.com/110226195971564876144/about?gl=us&amp;hl=en): Also in Greenpoint.  This is THE spot if you want to spend hours upon hours doing serious crate digging in a dank basement.  They probably have well over 100,000 records stacked from floor to wall absolutely everywhere.  You need to be dedicated as shit to spend the time here.  Also, wear something that you don't mind getting dusty.
- [Jazz Record Center](http://www.jazzrecordcenter.com/): Maybe the most secret and hard-to-find record store in NYC.  It's not on street-level, but inside a random unmarked office building on the 8th floor inside an office.  Inside one of the largest jazz collections I've ever seen outside of Jazz Record Mart in Chicago.  I could spend hours and thousands of dollars here.
- [Bleecker Street Records](http://bleeckerstreetrecordsnyc.com/store/bleecker.html): This is an older and well-known store that's affiliated with Generation records.  Recently, it moved off of Bleecker Street.  I haven't yet been to the new location, but this is a very good spot for rock music, including classic rock and punk.  They also have a large selection of movie soundtracks and jazz music.  I like their $1 section which is large.  Also, they've got cats that walk around the store.  The cats have been there for a long time.
- [Kim's Video](http://www.mondokims.com/): Very large record store with absolutely everything.  I love this place.  Prices are sometimes a bit high for the newer stuff they stock.  In addition to the music, they have one of the largest and best movie selections in the city.  I'm talking about everything from action blockbusters to rare random Italian films to obscure horror.  Truly something to check out.
- [Downtown Music Gallery](http://www.downtownmusicgallery.com/Main/index.htm): Weirdo store in Chinatown with large selection of free jazz, avant garde, and experimental music.",,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,t3_1uj7s0,,,False,,,,t1_ceinm7v,,,,1389014041.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1431822014.0,,,

I was lucky enough to see them a number of times during the 90s. Second time i saw them (mid 90s) was at a venue called Lomax, Liverpool. Around 100 people packed into a room big enough to hold 50! One of those nights when everybody in the room, including the band, were lucky enough to experience something special. Years later i read an interview with Stephen Malkmus in a music mag, he said the gig at the Lomax was one of the most memorable that Pavement played. He said that particular gig changed the band forever, they walked on stage as a struggling indie band trying to make an impact, walked off it as the hottest band on the planet - i totally agree with him, you needed to be there to understand why. Last time i saw them live was their second to last gig before they split, at The Academy, Manchester. Another great night. Best bit of advice i could ever give a fan of music is ""When all else fails, listen to Pavement"" A truly great, unique band!

A couple of tracks to stick on your iPods, one from Slanted &amp; Enchanted: Luxe &amp; Reduxe, and one from Mr Malkmus' last album - enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm sorry to tell you, but you are clearly out of touch with the realities of this project. This is not the first game we have made and this is not the only project that we are working on. I, as the project lead, am not only working on the development of this game, I have a full time job that I have to do if I want to make enough money to make it to the end of the week. I am also developing mods for Space Station 13 which runs on the Byond engine. I have been making mods for this game for a long time and collaborating with other developers on the game in order to make it a better game altogether. It was a game made from scratch and will continue to be a game made from scratch for as long as the community thrives and the game has already been the inspiration for several remakes such as http://www.centration.co/ which is another game currently on Kickstarter and steam greenlight as well as a couple of other games.

We already have plans of releasing the first alpha by mid 2014 where it will remain in alpha until we feel that we are happy with the playability of the game itself and we have finished the first chapter of this game.

This game also never had an intention of a AAA game. The game itself is being modeled after a game that was made on the Nintendo 64, a system where 3D was still very new in the console gaming industry. 
There are many other Indie developers who are still making games for RPG maker such as Mad Father, and don't you dare say Slender wasn't a hit, a game that was made on the Unity engine and can be considered as cutting edge as the PS4.

We are much farther into the project than pseudocode. Roughly 70% of the code that we want to implement in the first chapter alone has already been drawn out and we are already a decent way through coding most of it. Once again, this is not the first game we have made, and I have mentioned it several times throughout the production of this game that I have worked as a member of the development team in the Movie Battles 2 mod for Star Wars Jedi Knight Jedi Academy from B19 (Build 19) up until RC 0.0.2 (Release Candidate 0.0.2) where I left the development team so that I could concentrate on my studies, as that is when I started to attend college for a Computer Science (Technical) associates degree at Triton Community College in Illinois which would have had me taking quantum physics and quantum thermodynamics by my fourth semester.

The entire game as of this point has been completely funded by the developers out of their own pockets. Our lead sound technician has already dropped almost a thousand dollars just upgrading the equipment in his personal sound studio and has devoted countless hours looking for sound samples he can use and recording sound bits that we can use throughout the game. All of our sounds to be heard in-game will be high quality. A few of the songs he wrote can also be found at his sound cloud https://soundcloud.com/jessiferrr

All donations to the game are one hundred percent optional. We do not NEED to make a kickstarter to fund the project. We have all of the equipment we need to make this game successful and enjoyable for everyone. The game will be released free to play and we will be producing extra DLC free of charge which will mostly consist of extra side missions similar to how the Dragon Age series, Fallout, and the Elder Scrolls series released their DLC, except they charged people to download them.

We have also not received any donations for a number of reasons. Until now, the game had only been publicized through twitch streams and one or two isolated videos on YouTube which were quickly buried among our many League of Legends spotlights and videos which I do in my free time for fun and to help other players in the community. Most people have not even heard of the Fundrazr website. We did not use Fundrazr as a means of funding the game or as a means of publicity. It was simply a platform that we could post updates on as well as upload screenshots without having to worry about the page being taken down because the project went past it's ""to be funded"" date. Only when we believe the game is ready enough to be showcased will we create a Kickstarter page.

I am indeed currently the only developer in the game. The reason I say that is because while we have several experienced coders in the game, I am the only one actually writing the code. We have a decently large team working with us across the board. Kaos Sorenson, who made the plugin for Minecraft's Skyblock mod is only assisting our team with coding when we get stuck on an issue, much as a professor would help a student in a classroom when they're not sure how to implement an idea into their project and have it function smoothly. For the most part, Kaos Sorenson has been assisting us in the level design of a few of our larger areas of the game which are currently not ready to be released to the public. He is his own man with his own projects. This is not a full time thing for him in any way as he is a freelance coder and does not have the time to work with us. He has already stated to us that if we came up with the funds, he would gladly work with us full time, but as of right now we do not believe that we require his full time assistance. He has a much higher level of understanding in programming than a lot of our members and if we were to hire him onto the team, we would very quickly find ourselves unable to keep up with what he can produce.

All of our support comes from the people who put their time and energy to the game. Not everyone is able to donate money to game. If you think differently, I'm sure a hundred of other Indie developers would love to throttle you for attempting diminishing the value of their work simply because they, like me, are barely able to make ends meet yet continue to develop because they have a true passion for the game.

Here is a short list of the people working with us on the game. This is not nearly all of the people, but they have and continue to contribute a lot to the development.

Some people who are helping us already have a considerable amount of experience in the gaming industry, some have experiences in an industry that can be transferred in such as Cinematography or other forms of art. Some people are here just to get a foot in the door and learn from other people on the team. We are a multicultural and diverse team who have come together to make a game that will further our foothold in the gaming industry and produce a game that many people can both appreciate and enjoy. 

TL;DR: Grow up and get some perspective. The game will be completed and it will not be released until it fits our standards.",,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,t3_1qz46v,,,False,,,,t1_cdissm7,,,,1384958655.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1428582342.0,,,
t5_2scqj,,,,False,,,2.0,,,,GameAudio,,,,,,ccuh9kl,,,0,True,,,hapalilvegemite,,,t3_1ocf1t,2,,,,,,"OK, I'll have to preface this by saying that I come heavily from the film and TV world of sound design, not games. Given my limited experience in game audio, SSCheesyBread's comment makes sense, though it's my understanding that on the big blockbuster games out there, sound designers are often tasked simply with working with the sounds (in PT or whatever) and audio programmers do the engine work.

Sound design as we know it has its origins in sound editing for film. When Walter Murch started doing work both editing and mixing sound on Coppola movies, he took on the role of “designer”, partially because union rules didn't allow him to be doing both of those tasks, and partially because this signified a more intimate collaboration with a director with a focus on originality and storytelling, as opposed to the much more blue collar tradition of Hollywood post-production (get it done and get it out under budget). Fast forward to today, and if somebody from the music world (myself included) hears “sound design,” we automatically assume that, like in music, the ideas have to be original, they have to come out of the blue either from original recordings or synthesizers. Otherwise...that's just cut &amp; paste, right?

Well, not really. FriendlyBassplayer has it right – utilize what you have available in layers, with signal processing, make it your own. Ignoring signal processing, we have the essence of sound editing – a creative selection, combination and synchronization of sounds. Ben Burtt has said, more or less, that the key with sound design is knowing what the right sound is for the right moment. As you continue to experiment with layering, and listening on multiple playback systems, you'll realize that it doesn't quite work just...putting two winds together, and expecting Master &amp; Commander. Likewise, you can't just throw a bunch of heavy punches up and get something that has the finesse of the combat sounds in the newer Batman games. It wouldn't even work to use the punches to trigger a sidechain gate on a low sine wave – that'd get you part of the way there, but just part. When you layer, 2+2 can either equal 9, or 0. 

CressCrowbits mentioned budgetary reasons why it is important to know how to work with what you have – though I don't see that as unfortunate. I see that as...how it's done? There are very few projects out there in games or in film where every single sound was an original recording or synthesiza...mation... You name an A-list video game, maybe show me about 10 minutes of playthrough, and I'll name at least 2 libraries where some sounds were sourced. It's a nice idea, all original material, but nobody has time or money for that, and resources are better spent elsewhere. Let's say you're doing an indie space game, and there's some big explosions. Well, it's an indie, you don't have a crazy budget, and you're audio, so you have about $3.50, so don't try to recording your own ordnance on a shoestring – there are guys out there who make a living doing just that, and they're gonna do it better. So buy their explos. 

In 1992, Bram Stoker's Dracula won the Academy Award for Best Sound Editing. Aside from a standard fully filled foley job, the only custom effects on that show were some dry thunder recordings purchased from a friend of one of the sound supervisors. Everything else basically came off of different commercially available libraries, personal libraries of the effects editors, and then some Synclavier+other woo-woo toys trickery by Alan Howarth. 

TL;DR Use what you have, it's not “cheating,” it's how it's always been done. Record your own stuff when you can, no good sound designer doesn't own any of their own recordings. Synthesize if you like, but it's not that important. Acquire more sounds by purchasing libraries, meeting and trading with other sound designers and finding stuff made freely available. Play with signal processing on sounds, but don't overbake things, it'll sound like crap.",,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,t3_1ocf1t,,,False,,,,t1_ccuh9kl,,,,1382120862.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1429083952.0,,,

- **lack of general appreciation**

There just isn't the same number of people who understand games enough to appreciate them.  Sports are just as idiosyncratic with their rules and systems but no one makes an issue with them.

Anyone who's ever watched top level competitive gaming knows the sort of tension &amp; excitement is generates is equal to (if not superior, due to matches occuring in very compressed time periods compared to most sports) to any mainstream competitions, Evo moment 37 anyone ?

Even just think about the sort of logistics, planning &amp; real time co ordination it takes to pull of top level content in MMOs.  there is immense potential for business &amp; workplaces to benefit and learn from how people who live across vast distances and probably have never even shaken hands before can overcome incredible challenges with very low margins for error.


- **negative converage vastly outweighs positive coverage**

You're all probably familiar with the headlines especially about violence &amp; addiction.  But when was the last time you heard about the potential theraputic benefits of VR, the things Foldit has achieved or even just when gaming had a positive influence on a person ?

Additionally, 'serious' gaming (for lack of a better term) has zero mainstream presence.  There's big award shows to celebrate &amp; showcase the very best of film, television, literature, theatre, music &amp; science with adequate media coverage behind it.  Until games get something akin to the Academy Awards, Tony's or Nobel Prize, people will continue to be in the dark about the increidbly things games can do.

- **most people have only been exposed to bad games**

For most people, their first (and sometimes only) experience with gaming is either seeing someone they know repetitively grind away at CoD, WoW etc. or they play a banal social game.  In other words, to them, gaming = killing time at best or wasting time at worse.

There is a general unawareness to the fact that games can engage emotions other than frustration, rage and compulsion, e.g.

* the unparallel fear &amp; sense of insignificance of a masterfully crafted horror game.
* the incredible way Spec Ops the Line disturbs &amp; challenges you emotionally and mentally.
* the wonder, curiosity, companionship, dread, determination &amp; pure joy of ICO.
* Flower and Journey, serious props to Thatgamecompany and their amazing work.

Also all the ways indie developers experiment with the medium, random examples, Dear Ester, Cart Life, Dys4ia or heck even Minecraft
.

To echo what many others have said, it is a young medium and perceptions *are* changing, sometimes due to and sometimes despite of what the industry is doing.  More could be done, but as it is now the reputation of gaming is slowly getting better.

|**about artist**|Steven Paul ""Elliott"" Smith (August 6, 1969 – October 21, 2003) was an American songwriter and musician. Smith was born in Omaha, Nebraska, raised primarily in Texas, and resided for a significant portion of his life in Portland, Oregon, where he first gained popularity. His primary instrument was the guitar, but he was also proficient at piano, clarinet, bass, drums and harmonica. Smith had a distinctive vocal style characterized by his ""whispery, spiderweb-thin delivery"" and use of multi-tracking to create vocal harmonies.

Record companies make nominations, industry people vote.  Its all about the money and marketing.  A few comments from some artists from wikipedia….

When his band Pearl Jam won a Grammy in the category Best Hard Rock Performance in 1996, singer Eddie Vedder commented on stage: ""I don't know what this means. I don't think it means anything.""[16] Glen Hansard, leader of the Irish rock group The Frames, stated in 2008 that the Grammys represent something outside of the real world of music ""that's fully industry based."" He said he wasn't that interested in attending that year's ceremony, even though he had been nominated for two different awards.[16] Maynard James Keenan, lead singer of metal band Tool, did not attend the Grammy Awards ceremony to receive one of their awards. He explained his reasons:
I think the Grammys are nothing more than some gigantic promotional machine for the music industry. They cater to a low intellect and they feed the masses. They don't honor the arts or the artist for what he created. It's the music business celebrating itself. That's basically what it's all about.[17]
It has also been criticized for generally awarding or nominating more commercially successful albums rather than critically successful albums.[18][19] In a 2011 article, Los Angeles Times writer Randall Roberts was critical of the nominations for the 54th Grammy Awards, particularly for the Album of the Year category, noting the exclusion of Kanye West's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, ""the most critically acclaimed album of the year, a career-defining record"", as a snub in favor of nominating less substantial albums.[20] Roberts went on to criticize the Grammy Awards for being ""mired in the past"" and out of touch with ""new media"" and trends amongs music listeners such as music sharing, stating:
The major nominations for the 54th annual awards clearly show that the recording academy has been working overtime to be all-inclusive, but more significantly, they also reveal a deep chasm between its goals and the listening habits of the general population. [...] And if one were to measure the vitality of American music through the filter of the Grammy nominations for song of the year and record of the year, one might think the economy wasn't the only thing that was sluggish. [...] [T]he focus is still on the old music industry model of cash-cow hits, major label investments and commercial radio. [...] Falling behind the times is nothing new for the Grammys, but once they've lost sight of the artistry that makes music soar, they'll not just be irrelevant, they'll be out of business.[20]
—Randall Roberts
In an article for Time, journalist Touré also responded to the snub and expressed his general displeasure with the awards, stating ""I don’t pretend to understand the Grammys. I have never been able to discern a consistent logic around who gets nominated or who gets statues. I comprehend the particular logic of the Oscars, but not the big awards for music. My normal state of confusion around what drives Grammy decisions was exponentialized this week when, to the shock of many, Kanye’s masterpiece My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was not nominated for a Grammy for Album of the Year.""[21] He went on to compare understanding the Grammy Awards to Kremlinology and commented on The Recording Academy's exclusion of more ""mature"" hip hop albums as Album of the Year nominees, noting that it occasionally opts to nominate ""pop-friendly"" hip hop albums instead.[21]
In a 2011 profile for The New York Times following the 53rd Grammy Awards, frontman Justin Vernon of indie band Bon Iver was asked his opinion of the Grammys and how he would react to a nomination for his group, to which he responded,
You know I was thinking about that a couple of months ago, someone asked me that, and I was like ""I would go and I would"" – and I don’t think the Bon Iver record is the kind of record that would get nominated for a Grammy – ""I would get up there and be like, 'This is for my parents, because they supported me,' because I know they would think it would be stupid of me not to go up there. But I kinda felt like going up there and being like: ""Everyone should go home, this is ridiculous. You should not be doing this. We should not be gathering in a big room and looking at each other and pretending that this is important."" That's what I would say.[22]
He reaffirmed this sentiment and felt the Grammys are held in too, saying:
[Ninety-eight] percent of the people in that room, their art is compromised by the fact that they’re thinking that, and that they’re hoping to get that award. And who is that award given by? It’s like they think it’s literally handed down by the musical-history gods. And I don’t know who the voters are. Like, I have a friend who’s a voter who was like, “I had to be a voter because I don’t trust the other voters.” And I was like, “Me either!” And it’s just not important and people spend too much time thinking about it.[22]
—Justin Vernon
Bon Iver subsequently received four nominations in November for the 54th Grammy Awards.[22] After winning the award, Vernon said in his acceptance, ""It's really hard to accept this award. There's so much talent out here [...] and there's a lot of talent that's not here tonight. It's also hard to accept because you know, when I started to make songs I did it for the inherent reward of making songs, so I'm a little bit uncomfortable up here.""[23]
In his article ""Everything Is Praised Again"", Jon Caramanica of The New York Times criticized Grammy voters for being ""conservative"" and disregarding more ""forward-looking"" music, and wrote in response to the 54th Grammy Awards, ""for the umpteenth time, the Grammys went with familiarity over risk, bestowing album of the year honors (and several more) on an album that reinforced the values of an older generation suspicious of change.""[24] He cited the Grammy successes of Lauryn Hill's The Miseducation (1999), Norah Jones' Come Away with Me (2003), and Adele's 21 (2011) as examples of ""the Grammys dropp[ing] a boatload of awards on a young female singer-songwriter and her breakthrough album."" Of Kanye West's absence from the ceremony, Caramanica stated, ""He didn’t even bother to show up for the broadcast, which was well enough, because hip-hop was almost completely marginalized"".[24]
In an article for The Huffington Post, music executive and author Steve Stoute criticized the Recording Academy and the Grammy Awards for having ""lost touch with contemporary popular culture"" and noted ""two key sources"" for it: ""(1) over-zealousness to produce a popular show that is at odds with its own system of voting and (2) fundamental disrespect of cultural shifts as being viable and artistic.""[25] Stoute accused them of snubbing artists with more cultural impact, citing respective losses by the critical and commercial successes in Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP (2000) and Kanye West's Graduation (2007) in the Album of the Year category, and stated:
As an institution that celebrates artistic works of musicians, singers, songwriters, producers and technical specialists, we have come to expect that the Grammys upholds all of the values that reflect the very best in music that is born from our culture. Unfortunately, the awards show has become a series of hypocrisies and contradictions, leaving me to question why any contemporary popular artist would even participate. [...] While there is no doubt in my mind of the artistic talents of Steely Dan or Herbie Hancock, we must acknowledge the massive cultural impact of Eminem and Kanye West and how their music is shaping, influencing and defining the voice of a generation. It is this same cultural impact that acknowledged the commercial and critical success of Michael Jackson's Thriller in 1984.[25]

I thought all of those films were better than The Kings Speech and The Social Network, and, while that's an opinion, those are all critically acclaimed films that were objectively very well done. They aren't the type of film that the academy likes, however.

Why is this? Because the academy is a large group of people with different interests and different specialties. The most normal films will inevitably come forward, as they appeal to the most common tastes. The Social Network, just like all of the films I mentioned, was a well made film from that year. 

It wasn't as normal of a film, from Oscar standards, so it didn't win. Hollywood names in a historical drama with orchestral music and whatnot. It was also more normal for a film discussion type of film than any of the films I mentioned, and so it was not as forgotten. What's the next most discussed film? Black Swan, hollywood director with big name stars. After that? Blue Valentine and Rabbit Hole, borderline art house emotional joyrides. And next? Winter's Bone, indie baby of the year. Then Biutiful and Dogtooth, foreign films. Exit Through the Gift Shop, a documentary. Harry Potter, big blockbuster people don't think to hard about. Toy Story 3, children's film that people loved, but didn't talk about because it was a children's film.

The Social Network wasn't so weird that it only had a cult following, and wasn't so normal that it won the Oscar, so it hovers in that realm where everyone talks about it.

Not trying to be a dick here, but I think most of my opinions are pretty common, certainly about Eternal Sunshine. (#31 on IMDB) And that same reasoning would work for why Manos: Hands of Fate should have won. And its important to remember that the awards ARE a popularity contest, to one degree or another.

Eternal Sunshine is a pretty complex movie, with a LOT of meaning and complexity. Kaufman is widely considered one of the best writers around, and I think his script worked flawlessly with Gondry's directing.

&gt;I don't think that it deserved best picture of Million Dollar Baby and it certainly wasn't better than Sideways (in my humble opinion

See, I felt MDB was bland, and pretty textbook; I'd have to watch it again to say why, but one thing that hit me was how poor the twist was, it felt cheasy as hell. (and yet I thought that Gran Torino was a masterpiece, in storytelling at least, not some of the cast) Sideways, however, was pretty dull for me. It worked hard to check all the ""indie feel"" boxes. Thomas Haden Church and Paul Giamatti had PERFECT chemistry, and I could see a casting award, but I felt bored for a pretty wide portion of the film; it seemed other people were pretty widely devided as well though. Its just one of those movies that didn't work for a lot of people but was brilliant for others. Even THAT however, felt more deserving of best picture to me.

Finding Neverland also should have yielded to Eternal Sunshine. And The Aviator, at least, should have taken home the award over MDB.

&gt;Now I'm confused because it sounded like you were saying that the soundtrack for The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo &gt; Inception &gt; The Social Network. In any event, Reznor won and I think he deserved to win.

I thought that The Social Network, as a whole was *alright* (and I LOVE FINCHER) and in particular, its soundtrack was lacking; more importantly, it lost to the best work Zimmer has ever done, and the most widely recognizable soundtrack that decade. ""Time"" was art. The fact that the whole score is a derivative of the song used to wake the dreamers just compound the already impressive work.

Passing by how well the music worked for the movie, (which was flawless) the only track I can think of that rival's Inception's pop culture imapct (from this decade) is [Requiem for a Dream's theme,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22ut_pzoWgY) and the Pirates of the Carribean's theme. (which was a evolution of the Gladiator theme, and apparently the whole score was composed in just a few days) I felt his work on The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was a big step up, and probably worth at least a nomination in a sea of otherwise pretty uninspiring work that year, but I still don't think he's on the same level as some other composers yet.



There is plenty of argument about poor academy choice to have, some bigger than others. EG How Green was my Valley beat Citizen FUCKING Cane, and The Maltese ""DAMN DATS A CLASSIC"" Falcon. Se7en lost getting so much as a best picture nod to freaking Babe.  Hell, The Shawshank Redemption, IMDB's #1 movie of all time, didn't win a single thing. And don't get me started on Shakespeare in Love beating Saving Private Ryan, while The Truman Show and The Big Lebowski didn't get any mention. 

There are countless more utterly unforgivable screwups by the Academy, but I find it better to just not care anymore. Sometimes they choose correctly, sometimes Inception loses best soundtrack to The Social Network.",,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,t3_1hrmkv,,,False,,,,t1_caxr3za,,,,1373227906.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1430552672.0,,,

&gt;I love the outdoors, I love music, and I love to turn wrenches. Maybe someday I'll grow up but I'm having too much fun right now. 

Okay. So does everyone. Paint us a picture.

Sounds like something you aren't doing. Pick some goals, man. Ambition is hot. Having vague plans in opposite directions is not.

Sounds bland. ""Biting my tongue to prevent me from making poorly timed comments on the priest's shoe choice during strangers' funerals."" Or something. Don't talk about what you don't do, make it active.

&gt;I don't pay attention to that nonsense

Edgy. Or douchey?

Palo Alto itself is about 30 miles south of San Francisco. If you're into hiking there's some pretty decent hikes here. Castle Rock Park is in the Santa Cruz Mountains, has lots of redwood trees and ferns, usually you can see deer, birds, other wildlife. Rancho San Antonio is also good for hiking although its more scrub oak chaparral than redwoods. Muir Woods north of the city has lots of redwoods, easy trails and is close to a small beach if you wants some more laid back hiking.

The city. For touristy stuff, I'd start in Union Square. Thats in the main shopping district, lots of designer clothes and jewelry, things like that. Union Square usually has big public things going on as well, stuff like dance exhibitions or art or, sometimes, protests. I was there a year or so ago and there was a big Palestinian rights protest going on. From Union Square one can take the famous cable car to Ghirardhelli Square. Famous chocolate company, lots of stuff there to see. Lots of little art galleries outside. Picasso, Chagall, stuff like that. They're small, you can look in twenty minutes or so. Kind of like a mini-art museum. From there its a pretty short walk along the waterfront to Fisherman's Wharf. Lots of seafood along the way. Usually street performers like they have in Venice Beach. Then you can take a cable car back from Fisherman's Wharf to Union Square. There is also the Golden Gate Bridge, lots of places will rent bikes that you can ride across on a nice day. From Fisherman's Wharf you can get tickets to visit Alcatraz.

For clubs, there's a place in downtown around 10th and Folsom thats called the DNA Lounge. Two dance floors and they pump AC through the floor so you don't get quite as sweaty and nasty. usually have a DJ. Sometimes they'll have a live band playing mixups. Crazy on the weekends. Place called the Supper Club at 3rd and Harrison that also has a couple of dance floors. More techno / top 40. Another place called the bubble lounge at Jackson and Montgomery that's a champagne bar. usually a bit more upscale, definitely pricy but if she wants dancing thats also a bit classier.

For more bars and music scene, I'd look at the Fillmore, the Great American Music Hall, Hotel Utah, or Bottom of the Hill. All four typically feature live music, usually rock or indie rock bands. If she's here on a Tuesday night, a club called PopScene plays new bands, typically from either the UK, Netherlands or France that are making their first appearance in the states. For kind of dive bars, there's a place called Amnesia in the Mission District or one called Grant and Green in the Marina that are usually chill and with entertaining people.

For food, there is a lot of good Italian places along Columbus street in Little Italy. Lot of seafood along the Wharf between Ghirardelli and Fisherman's Wharf. Lots of trendier places in the Mission District, around 23rd and Valencia. Tons of small little places around the city. Great vegetarian restaurant called Greens at the Fort Mason Center, usually you'll need reservations. The food is good enough that you wouldn't notice it was vegetarian unless they told you.

Good comedy shows at a place called Cobb's or there is an improv comedy group called the Bay Area Theatre Society that performs at the Fort Mason Center. Couple of places that do live theater if you likes drama or Broadway.

For art or museum stuff, there is the De Young Museum of Fine Art in Golden Gate Park. Across the street there is the California Academy of Sciences. Lots of cool science exhibits if you're into that. On Thursday nights they do something called nightlife where they'll bring in DJs, performers, speakers and alcohol and let people come in late from like 7 pm to 11 pm.

Yeah I said it.  Here's my reasoning:

1) Big budget tentpole productions can make any fucking world to any degree of detail they actually want anymore.  Sure there's still the R&amp;D going into Cameronian worlds of Noble Savages and Baysian worlds of product-stamped robots fighting over familiar American metropolises, but nevertheless what used to be 'special' effects is now a beautifully detailed normative escapist fantasmagoria delivered nearly every week.

2) Not into that?  AWESOME!  You know what else the world has?  THE REST OF THE WORLD, now with 100000x more accessibility.  In the past if you wanted to see a French film or a Japanese movie or whatever, you had to hope your local cinema had a screen for those big name international darlings like Truffaut or Kurosawa.  Now you have independent DVD distributors releasing everything from the festival darlings to the small guys to the schlock trash cinema, from countries you didn't even know had a working digital camera among them.  Want movies from France and Japan?  Bitch please, there're entire aisles devoted to those countries in brick and mortar stores in many cities... and if not in cities, at least as searchable metadata on Amazon.com.  But that's just hard-copy media.  With streaming and downloads and fan-written subtitles, and with enough dedication, you can watch whatever the hell you like from any country you can name.  So have at.  

3) But all that's just cramping the style of those American independents, right? It's not like stuff like *Another Earth* or *The Place Beyond the Pines* or *Mud* or *The Fountain* or *Drive* or *The Killer Inside Me* is showing up.  In fact the real significant problem facing American independent directors is that there's so much content available it's difficult to be heard above the rest!  It's not just monolithic studios crowding out the market with 17 features each per year, but all sorts of $20k personal productions being made by the dude down the street all over the country, typically utilizing state tax refunds and a few opportunistic jumps into the new funding du jour (today crowdfunding, tomorrow: ?).  It's complicated but shit does get done, the biggest problem facing them is monetization.  And in the meantime if we want to talk about Indie with a capital I (aka studio indies), Wes Anderson and Darren Aronofsky and Quentin Tarantino and Walter Salles and Michael Winterbottom and Terrence Malick are STILL making movies.  

4) Wanna talk about Pixar?  Fuck yeah let's talk Pixar.  This one'll be Pixar part 1.  Pixar part 1 is, how's animation been over the past decade or so?  You know what, it's been friggin' great.  Whilst before we had Disney releases and only the very occasional, very rare *Fritz the Cat*, and Don Bluth as one of the sole names against the Disney norm, now we have major studios all with their animation divisions, adult animation as a regular thing from Adult Swim and similar producers, anime has found its place in the American market and abroad, the French have been killing the hand-drawn feature length stuff with anything from *The Triplets of Belleville* to *A Cat in Paris*, and at this point we're getting close to not only photorealism, but hyperrealism in animation opening up god knows how many possibilities, all while little guys are getting into animation easier than ever with readily accessible 3D and compositing programs anywhere from freeware to Maya.

5) Pixar Part 2: AKA Disney letting its eggs grow freerange style.  Disney buys Pixar and retains John Lasseter as creative director.  Disney buys Marvel and retains its creative directors, and the film directors with the biggest hits for Marvel (Jon Favreau and Joss Whedon) get creative executive input into subsequent releases.  Disney buys Lucasfilm and at Lucas' admonition, keeps his continuity expert on hand to keep up her thing and gets the biggest names in geek awesomeness to be involved in the production of a brand new trilogy.  In other words, Disney figured out its shit: buy an already enfranchised household name, then let it thrive on its own without too much creative control.  Yeah Pixar's been faltering as of late but that was predicted back when they announced they were switching from an every other year to every year release, and for that matter a lot of their individual original concept films have struggled.  So their pipeline of original content has faltered as of late and that's a matter of some concern.  It's not, as is commonly thought, simply a matter of Disney wanting sequels.  Reading up on the story behind *Brave* and especially how *Rio* supplanted an original Pixar film can help understanding that the current sequelification isn't entirely Pixar's fault.  All in all more corporations SHOULD pick up the Disney model: buy specific brand-name production companies to give them more monetary support and outreach and divisional accessibility, but retain their creative roots and let them generally do what they do.  Price according to market.

6) Well, hey, you know what?  Let's actually talk about these serialized franchises and how I actually consider them a good thing.  I know right, what could I be thinking, everyone knows Fast and Furious 6 is a sign of the end times of original and creative thought.  But no really.  Have you noticed actually that they've stopped numbering sequels?  And that many of those sequels actually kind of stand alone?  And how more and more often a new director can jump into a franchise and make a more personal approach to the characters outside the wider identity of what the character is (Christopher Nolan)?  If that's bad, then so is Frank Miller or Alan Moore taking on Batman in comic books back in the 80s: my argument here is that Hollywood IS becoming comic-book like in serial format releasing, and that that's a great thing.  It means if you like Jack Sparrow, you can keep watching Pirates of the Caribbean to your hearts content, but if you don't like Iron Man, fuck it, don't watch it.  You don't have to, because you know which characters you dig and you know which characters you don't.  James Bond movies disappointing you, there's GI Joe.  Not a huge fan of Mission Impossible, maybe you're into Fast and Furious.  Whatever.  You watch what you like.  My point here is that franchises themselves are becoming specific niche markets, which you are free to participate in or ignore as is your wont.  

And yet again, since most people complain about the very thing that I think is great, if you just don't like big budget enfranchised serialization ad nauseum, there's ALWAYS something else being produced from pick a country, any country, in any genre, pick a genre.  We're friggin' *drowned* in choice.  We have so much choice it's actually more of a problem than the lack thereof from the big studio productions.  

But no.  Let's have the guy who wins Academy Awards for multi-million dollar two-hour long music videos (and I love love love Danny Boyle's movies, by the way) tell us that everything's going to shit and switching the hotword ""Disneyfication"" of the 90s with ""Pixarification"" to attract the Millennials' attention.  

I'm not a fan of slow gray decay of the universe narratives.  These days are great, I'm never at lack of badass awesome cinema to watch nearly every single day.  I'm about to spend the next year reviewing every single Zatoichi film featuring Katsu as the titular character, after this last week I spent watching Shane Carruth's long-awaited followup *Upstream Color*, as I gear down to see *Iron Man 3* with my friends who typically come over to watch Marvel motion comics with me off of Netflix, when I'm not busy visiting experimental film festivals, working on a YouTube miniseries with some local guys with discounted digital cinema cameras they own themselves, or eagerly pouring through the periodicals waiting for the next Guy Maddin, Olivier Assayas, or Michel Gondry picture, not to mention Danny Boyle himself or if all else fails, motherfucking Takashi Miike makes like four movies a year and that's a solid promise of entertainment.  Jesus Christ I never have enough time to watch all of the awesome shit that's being produced every friggin' year.  

Oh, and I haven't EVEN gotten into the new accessibility and availability of old classics on DVD and streaming and download, from the silent era or all the 70s greats that Boyle is talking about or even, get this, a local theatre is presenting almost every Kubrick film on the big screen this summer (minus *Lolita* and *Fear and Desire*) while even the big evil multiplexes have their digital restoration series of shit like *Blazing Saddles* and *Alien* coming out, I mean Jesus Christ people how can you complain about all the bad stuff when there's so much good stuff friggin' everywhere every day?

He's a well known blogger / product reviewer, and that's fine, but I certainly wouldn't base what he does as criteria for what is good or correct. Look at academy award winning cinematographers for that.

I don't know what ""pro's"" you're talking about, but few people shoot full frame. The way FF treats focus is basically like speaking a different visual language, and unless you translate fluently, it will hurt your story, and that is what filmmaking is all about, not what tool you use to tell it. Also, photographers are not the same as DP's, and you can run into some serious problems with a photographer who is DP'ing a motion project, ie, they don't understand camera motion, shutter speeds, cinema lenses, camera physics (ie size) and even things like framing for proper story-telling, or holding a subject long enough. Watch a still photographer try to DP a music video, or a fashion commercial; they're used to needing 1/100th of a second, they almost inevitably never hold a mark for long enough.

Here's the thing; outside of say, an ultra-low-budget indie production where everyones getting $100/day, if you can't afford to be shooting on a Red or Alexa, you're likely not paying your operator that much, and that means your operator likely doesn't know what he's doing. That said, when you're just getting you're feet wet, you may not have anything else available. I shot my first good spec's on DSLR, but I wouldn't have considered myself a pro then.",,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,t3_1cn8a3,,,False,,,,t1_c9ie54l,,,,1366363205.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1431502374.0,,,

Led Zeppelin is the greatest band of all time, Tom Petty holds a place in my heart as well as my iPod. I could go on for hours about countless classic rock bands/artists I thoroughly enjoy. Lots of reggae too. Huge Slightly Stoopid, Matisyahu, Dirty Heads, Sublime (without Rome please), Pepper (fucking love Pepper please listen to these [mellow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZayY6FxVuto) [upbeat/funny](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfPXlCuSKHA)), The Expendables (seeing them live tomorrow, woot!), Bob obviously, Jimmy Cliff, Peter Tosh, Easy Star All-Stars as well as the Long Beach Dub All-Stars. Almost all 90's alternative and grunge, as well as current and recent indie rock. Also a big fan of dubstep and more recently trap music, which is somewhat of an offshoot. Guys like Baauer (beyond Harlem Shake), TNGHT, Flosstrodamus, Charlie Traplin. Loved pop punk in its day, particularly The Academy Is...

So what if there are more people making music and movies who don't know how? There's _also_ many more of the people who _do_ know, and who previously could have made it but for the strict rules of economics. We literally have a situation now where an _Academy award winning film_ was shot on an iPhone. And you're still saying we should go back to the ""good old days"" where making a movies was expensive to the degree of excluding many would-be directors and creators?

Have you seen some of the short films people are making with their inexpensive dSLRs or smartphones? The editing these people can so easily do with just an iPad or a laptop? The visual effects these people can create, with virtually no limit whatsoever to their creativity? I cannot accept you labeling that as something negative.

Same with music. Yeah, sure, _of course_ crappy bands now also get to record their crappy music and distribute it all over the world. But who cares? Did you listen to crappy music before? Do you listen to crappy music now? No. But I bet you listen to _good_ music, and there are exponentially more _good_ bands making _good_ music in DIY studios, selling it on their own on the internet and getting a worldwide audience, simply because it's gotten _so easy_ and comparably _so cheap_ to produce something professional sounding.

I did grow up in the digital era. I grew up with CDs mostly, with some cassettes and vinyl records here and there. As I grew older, Napster happened, and then MP3 players, iPods, smartphones, tablets... Now I listen to more great music than I ever did before. Why? Because even _old_, good music is more accessible now with the digital stores. I get to go on Spotify and listen to one of my favorite albums, and what does Spotify do? It recommends _more_ like that, and so I find more artists, more albums, which lead to more artists, and more albums...

And I do _listen_ to albums. Your view of ""kids"" only listening to shuffled playlists is, to be honest, a tad ignorant and elitist. Not all kids care about music to begin with, and didn't before either. Some do. Some are obsessed with it, and I guarantee you that these kids listen to full albums the way the artist envisioned them (vinyl isn't the primary format any longer, records are _made_ for digital these days. You do know that, right?), and they go to the concerts, and buy the t-shirts and DVDs and other merchandise. These kids are _fans_. Just because they don't listen to what _you_ like on the format _you_ prefer, doesn't make that any less true.

You know I have no problem with you preferring vinyl, but this idea you have that the post-vinyl music scene has somehow deteriorated or stagnated is completely blind to reality and the facts. Even the music _industry_, which many artists as well as fans now bypass completely, is thriving, making more and more money every year. Hell, I'm willing to bet that _digital_, meaning both music in the digital form and _music communities_ in the digital domain, have made more to feed this resurgence of vinyl than anything else. Thanks to these kids' new favorite indie bands, who only even exist because it's now so cheap and easy to make music and sell it yourself without the need for labels or contracts or PR firms, vinyl has made a comeback. Maybe partly because of the hipster thing, maybe partly because they actually agree it's somehow better, but I'd bet you a lot that it wouldn't have happened had the digital revolution not gone as it did.",,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,t3_199a0x,,,False,,,,t1_c8mhe3g,,,,1361948488.0,,0,,,,,,,,,1431424525.0,,,

Independent Games Festival

The original proving ground for both independent and student game developers (and still the largest festival celebrating indie games), the IGF has recognized more DigiPen student games than those of any other school in the world.

Since the IGF began its Student Showcase in 2001, it has granted 44 awards  to 34 DigiPen student projects. DigiPen games have earned the coveted “Best Student Game” title for three of the six years that the IGF has awarded it, and have even won awards in categories competing against professional developers – making DigiPen one of the only schools in the world to do so.

Partway down I note that I'm done talking about the video specifically and during that time was looking at some others, so you don't need to read all of it for the feedback on the video itself. 

Do ships always come out of bases one by one? If there is any base that has a large opening where more than one ship is pouring out at a time that might be more informative and tells me there can be really large bays with big mouths. People will always assume you can get it down to small bays where only one will fit leaving the base but people can't assume there will be  larger than you show.

(auto track guns loots awesome and is a bridge between the two 'types' of space shooters in a very cool way. Part of the reason I sadly can't get into Eve and other space shooters with similar combat mechanics)

There's little difference between Bases and space stations in this video. I can make the assumption from the video that bases are your HQ's of some sort and space stations appear to be quite a bit smaller and plausibly not have room for being a carrier, but that's about it. Also there shouldn't be something right behind the station at least right at the beginning, at first look they look like a single object which throws off the eyes. Tiny minor gripe that some people might focus on and think about 'i hate when that happens' and briefly not focus on what they should be, your video!

I had to go back to see what you meant by physics as the small ship isn't what I thought I was to be focusing on. Its a really cool feature that deserves a shot where it will be much more the center of attention will help. If people don't see it off the bat they might assume your not actually showing it but put in some filler(remember theres plenty of bad indies out there that **would** do it and people are quick to judge if they don't see something right off the bat).

As a possible suggestion for that physics clip, have the ship large enough to effect an asteroid. Shooting a couple times at a rock was informative. Having a ship thats heavily damaged spin out of control then slam into an asteroid would be really cool and still informative. Having that asteroid visibly move away from the crash with some bits flying off would be spectacular, and still informative. If you have to modify some settings enough to make it very visibly clear that a ship explosion(and/or shooting at it) can make an asteroid move as well as break apart some. DO NOT make it look like the asteroid is completely blown apart. Otherwise it might simply look like when a asteroid it hit it blows up into gibs that probably disappear soon after the clip ends to a viewer!

I really do feel like modding needs to be on a separate image than the finisher title. I may feel it would be good to have as the very first thing, but some others might not-I'm a **huge** advocate/fan for moddability in games, and it makes a game like yours much more appealing to some people that might leave before they see that. Also, for as long as there is any way to get your game free or not, put it at the very beginning until release. At the end of the video people might think 'cool i might get that when it comes out'. Instead you want 'cool i can let this download in the background and play it if I really find it interesting enough' or at least have the page open so when they move on to something else and find it later they can reconsider downloading it. 

The video would need sound, even if its only music. If you can get game sound in try to get as wide a variety in as you can. If nearly every battle clip includes different gun and engine sounds that will make it that much more appealing, even if you have to misplace some. If you can have voiceover you can include a sentence or two worth of information. If you don't have much confidence in your voice doing the job I'm hopeful you find an amatuer voice actor looking to fill their portfolio. Don't go for the movie trailer voice for this kind of thing, think Khan Academy voice. Short, informative information that is explained clearly and not hyped up. 

There is no indication whether there is a campaign mode of some sort of 'continuing' game that you would have where your doing something over the course of multiple maps/having missions. There is no indication whether there is story(fine if its a very basic story, but if you do have a narrative beyond 'the enemy is the enemy and you are you, then its worth putting in. If there are factions/nations/etc then that is a good way to tell the viewer that by throwing up a faction and then another faction with slightly different paint jobs and possibly different looking tech). Even if in the end your factions can all pull from the exact same stuff, someone that mods the game will be creating different looks for custom 'races' so it will happen one way or another.

Two guns and a few types of rockets are shown(at least separately) here. I would consider consolidating that into one 'reveal' under some banner like ""variety of weaponry"" and show off as many as you have polished enough for view preferable on a single ship shooting in somewhat different directions off into space. 





I really hope after release you will be able to make multiplayer skirmishes possible. If your familiar with Space Pirates And Zombies they started out completely unmoddable. When they threw a patch out with it it garnered a lot of attention again and was in some stories, and thats with only one mod being able to ever be active at the same time. I feel like multiplayer capabilities would have a similar or even greater affect especially on a game with mods available. 


I noticed in another video that you can definitely mod ships, but in the one you linked it appeared to only be stations/base parts shown. Make sure you can see both bases/stations as well as ships in the videos being edited, as some games might have one but not the other. 

Other crap not related to your video specifically:

I feel like multiplayer capabilities would have a similar or even greater affect especially on a game with mods available. 

I do hope you can get some good music into the game. I've noticed a large number of space games have really solid soundtracks that are worth listening to on their own, and I feel like that should be the goal. It makes playing the game more solid because even if your in a boring part your still being entertained by the music. 

(*note, I know particles can be computing intensive so anything I say on them is assuming my suggestions won't put a heavier load on the users computer*)

The dualist - Canister gun has a particle effect that sort of  flys back. Realistically I can see reasons this would happen given where the particles are coming from, but a small cloud staying in place of where it initially 'turned on' would be cool even though it might not always be noticed given people are usually moving around. 

The Boa particle effect could plausibly look better if the 'dirt' looking stuff would break apart and thin out more before disappearing. Maybe instead of little triangles coming off it to makes them diamond shape would make it look a little more like its thinning out into the vastness of space, or even simply turning the triangles around. Oddly enough when hitting another ship it doesn't seem to give that feeling of oddness to me. 

The UI is great looking right now, but I've yet to ever find a game that couldn't benefit from customization. Things as simple as being able to change the aqua blue color to something different, progress bars having different hues than fully charged bars, mutliple different or custom crosshairs that you can import, etc. is something often talked about in games that don't have them. It also gets rid of the problem of having to choose for the user. If someone doesn't like a specific crosshair or is color blind(HUGE RIGHT HERE!), then they can fix it themselves. These are often things that don't get complained about a lot but still effects the experience of the one playing. 

Back to modding(again), if your a few hours into coding something like skeletal animations for a biotic ship but for some reason find it lacking, throw it in there unused with some sort of marker on it. Parts of unimplemented features can jumpstart mods that otherwise might take a lot longer to develop or aren't thought of. I can't think of which game it was, but an unimplemented feature ended up inspiring a really cool and popular mod.

This is a really cool looking game that is a step outside of a number of others I've seen. I have the alpha downloaded and registered at the forums. I'm hopeful to see the game succeed and think all it needs is good enough publicity to get it off the ground once its finished, its already shaping up to look and play very nice. Again, sorry for how stupid long this was. I get into finding the tiniest ways to improve stuff like this and thinking about what might flesh it out more, so incomplete games are a gold mine.

Clearly this is not a completed list but hopefully it's a good starting off point.

Also try taking your hearing aids out and turning your speakers/subwoofers onto the floor and putting it on max volume, then play some drum and bass bands, like [Pendulum](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEPB7uzKuh4&amp;feature=relmfu) for example, it's how other deaf people listen to music and apparently it's kind of cool.

If people want to do stuff for other genres that would also be awesome, I'm afraid my music knowledge isn't as great in those!

By this I mean Hollywood realizing that today it is much cheaper to produce and distribute media, even quality media (and the quality keeps increasing / production cost decreasing). End of story. No going back.

What is *not* cheap, and will never be, are large-scale multi-million dollar productions and events. 

Hollywood needs to slowly get out of the game of indie films, TV, news, music, books -- leave that to the little guys; we're learning how to do it pretty well. 

**Instead,** Hollywood needs to stick to and expand on the one service they *can* do better than anyone, and for which they would not have competition: 

* epic movie EVENTS. I don't mean transformers, I mean LOTR, Spiderman II, Batman II, Avatar, Jurassic Par, Toy Story, Titanic, etc. — Quality epic experiences that I would happily pay $20 to see. 

* Technologically innovative media on a large scale: imagine if the Academy awards was a massive, theatrical, 3D event that was broadcast to theatres and home theatres around the world. Would you not pay good money to join in on the experience? Same with the superbowl, concert series (The Wall style), etc. 

The technology exists, and only Hollywood would have the resources to put such events together. 

But no, instead of giving their audience unique experiences and thinking outside the box, learning to compete in a new world of media, they choose to spend millions of dollars trying to keep everyone *else* back.

It's people from other eras interested in disco music. Basically it's a revival of disco using modern things. If we take classic disco tracks, almost all of them sound really good, but they suck in a club environment since they didn't have the technology we have today. The whole disco revival got big with Daft Punk, Cassius, Alex Brake and a bunch of french guys, but it has taken some different forks recently, specially when people started with the disco punk things, like LCD SoundSystem. 

Yeah, Nu-disco is NOT micro-niche. Since Disco is the grandfather of House. And house is a genre like rock. Disco is a incredible vague description for a genre, specially since we have Space Disco, Acid Disco, Funk Disco and anything else you can imagine. 

You just don't know that people like Metro Area, Duck Sauce and (more recently) Kate Parry's Last Friday Night are seen as Nu-Disco. 

So - answering the question: take a listen at soundcloud.com/j4ck_sh4rk - most of my songs are nu-disco, take a listen, post any questions about production you might have. My main tips would be: Pay attention to classic disco drums structure (structure, not the sound). It's one of the main characteristics of disco. Retro-style synths are also a must, usually Wurlitzers, Taurus and Moogs - or if you prefer the modern French house scene, JUNOs and Super Saw Synths

Depending on what DAW you're using, there are different solutions:

If you're using REASON you should look for 2 incredible special reffils:

1.) Reason Electric Bass (www.propellerheads.se/products/refills/reb/) I always use it. It's the closest you can get to a real bass without having to have a bass and a bass player and all the problems that come with recording at home. Always remember that the BASS should be heavly compressed, usually with some EQ on MID so it has that Justice's We Are Your Friends' Bass Crunch. Always consider ducking the bass with some side chain - it helps getting that pumping feeling - like Barbra Streisand.  

2.) ElectroMechanical 2.0 (http://www.propellerheads.se/products/refills/electromechanical/) You will eventually need one of these. It helps adding that vintage feeling. It's also very useful for indie music (EX.: General Elektriks - ""Take Back The Instant"" (www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQuBmdjFtBc) The rhodes are used in more mellow songs, but the Clavinet has a very special sound, you should always remember that you can use a Wah effect with these. 

Now, these 2 reffils basically give you all the basics you need to get some leads, fills and bass sounds. Drums are much more complicated. Standard disco drums do not work in this case. You're gonna have to build your own library of samples while you 'shape' your sound. Some artists use classic 909 &amp; 808 samples, like Daft Punk and Cassius. Others prefer a more realistic thing, like Midnight Magic. 

Drum samples can be found with simple google searches, but, as stated before, pay close attention to Disco Drum Structure, it's the soul of the thing. 

If you're NOT using reason - there's still hope. I have a pretty good VST selection at home - including some classic BASS simulators, I'll post them here later if anyone is interested. 

But this is just the basics. Nu-disco can go into very different areas, from Frankie Knuckles remix of Blind (which is almost deep house) to Rapture's  House of Jealous Lovers, which is almost punk. You have people who do sample based disco (youtube user EvilStereo has a small series on sampling in house music, it might help a lot www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiFGRPjLJD8)

Also Sonic Academy has 2 series on Disco - one of them is making samples to use in Nu-Disco situations - basically it's a safe way of 'getting legal samples'

Well, this covers the basics, if you do use Reason and want more tips, just drop a message =)

There was a horrible recession going here in Canada.  No part-time jobs for kids, zero.  No money meant the school parking lot was empty and you walked.  Cheap manufacturing had not yet brought cheap clothing over, so you had only expensive clothes from places like the Gap, or ugly shit from a discount store.  No H&amp;M or American Eagle.  No cheap cell phones yet or cheap computers, and the only damn music you got was at record stores and it sucked, no indie scene, no internet for distribution.  Plus you grew up in AIDS scare hell, no fucking either.  No one yet knew the about eating low carb diets, and girls couldn’t didn’t have their look down packed because they didn’t have youtube for makeup and hair tutorials yet.  Basically, everyone looked like shit, dressed like shit, had no money, walked everywhere, and the music mostly sucked (except for rage, tool, beasties).

The 90’s only saving grace for me was the rave scene.  All my friends spun, and we used haul our butts to downtown record stores all the time, and go to awesome raves and after-hours.

Now it is awesome.  Indie music online, internet to learn everything (TED Khan Academy, etc...), cheap cell phones and computers, everyone dressers way nicer and looks better.

There's a decent amount of live music in various pubs and places if you look hard enough. I believe the Purple Turtle is the student place to be for indie/rock/metal, has the odd live show, and is where the university rock music society hangs out a lot.  The Bullingdon Arms on Cowley Road often has live gigs on most nights, including an awesome (free) jazz set every tuesday night, and anything from blues/punk/country/rock the rest of the week.  The Regal and the O2 Academy (both on Cowley road) are where the big names generally play.

&gt; Loves me a good pub and meal out aswell.

There's no shortage of amazing and characterful pubs in Oxford -- the Kings Arms (aka KA), The Turf, The Eagle and Child, and The Lamb and Flag (all city center) are all very popular both with locals and the tourists.  I'd go on about some of the lesser known ones but really there's just too many to count!

&gt; I'm just getting started in professional writing (news reporting at the moment) so I'll have to look into that scene once I get there.

Would you be looking for a paid job, or voluntary work? I did a bit of voluntary photography with The Oxford Student newspaper last year, just for fun -- as they're a student-run publication, they're a bit short of cash.  The other student newspaper is the Cherwell which is actually published independently of the university, so may be slightly more promising for paid work.  Both newspapers are of a pretty high quality for student publications, from what I can tell.  The local 'professional' paper is The Oxford Mail, which you might want to look into.

Hope that helps a little!",,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,t3_ifq2e,,,False,,,,t1_c23ffjo,,,,1309731362,,0,,,,,,,,,1427311285.0,,,

* Thekla - Club on a boat; plays a variety of music styles
* Bunker - Good general pop club
* La Rocca - 80's cheese and good crowd

Some good bars

Your other question: ""It is safe to walk at night""; there is trouble as with any city but only if you get involved in it, Bristol is pretty laid back thought tbh; stick to Park Street, Bishopston and Centre and you'll be fine

I was young and wanted the heaviest, fastest stuff I could get.

My tastes softened a bit after I reconnected with some friends from my childhood who were into mall emo and screamo music. I never got into The Academy Is or bands like that, always listening to heavier stuff than they did (August Burns Red and Norma Jean, which I still consider good bands but don't like anymore), but bands like A Day to Remember and Broadway found their way into my music collection as a result of their influence.

So a lot of crappy music so far.

Anyway, one day I realized I liked absolutely nothing on my iPod. I was tired of high-pitched male vocals, breakdowns *in every song*, as well as the use of auto-tune and over production that made the music sound cold and dead.

So I decided to give The Dead Weather another chance. My aunt had burned their CD for me a while back but I didn't like it back then. I thought it was just random noises and I perceived it as unstructured because it didn't follow the intro-verse-chorus-verse-chorus-breakdown-end formula I was used to.

I ended up loving it and started finding similar bands, eventually branching off into shoegaze, noise pop, indie, and other various sub-genres. For the first time, I stared to listening to a lot of bands that existed before I was born and I stopped being so closed minded about my tastes. Now I've got a much larger, more diverse music collection, even if it is esoteric and kinda hipster.

Funnily enough, the first CD I bought was from the Barenaked Ladies. They've stuck around through all these changes and I still listen to them.",,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,t3_hmjuq,,,False,,,,t1_c1wlemg,,,,1306640286,,0,,,,,,,,,1427191188.0,,,

There's direct marketing to members of the academy from every studio, and usually the primary motivators for a nomination (unless there's some crazy grassroots appreciation groundswell), stems from a mixture of positive press and marketing dollars. Hurt Locker was already quite well-known and favored in the hollywood scene without the help of illegal downloads, due in large part to overwhelming positive reviews stating it was oscar material, plus lobbying to the academy.

And frankly, while this guy's email response was pretty pathetic, you have to understand his sentiments... as pirating increases and revenues drop, mid-budget films are the first to go (it's already happening). That means more Avatars and zero-budget youtube shows, less Hurt Lockers. This is what already happened to the music industry (which now only features superstars and indies with very few long-term mid-tier acts who aren't jam bands).

t5_2qh1u,,,,True,,,6.0,,,,Music,,,,,,c0npl4t,,,0,True,,,railstay,,,t3_bnulq,6,,,,,,"There are definitely snobs, but there are also people who consider music a very important part of their lives and expect certain things from it.  The best way to be able to distinguish the two is by their standard of judgment.

For example, I like music, but I love literature and movies.  I thought District 9 was garbage and at the same time I love True Lies.  How can this be possible?  Well, because I judge any piece of art or entertainment by what it's trying to accomplish.  I thought District 9 was a sloppy movie that used aliens as a very heavy-handed Aesop about racism.  It was so blatantly clear that the humans were just being complete dicks and the prawns were being horribly mistreated.  It is tired, predictable and does not explore the implications of the trope in a new or interesting way.  There is way more stuff out there about tense human-alien relationships that are not so black and white, and are also much more believable.  [Speaker for the Dead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_for_the_dead) did it beautifully, and Ender's Game before that touched upon it lightly.  What are the odds that a race like the prawns would share the same moral standards as us?  If you are different biologically, then your morals must also be fundamentally different.  As a crude example, sentient race of super insects is not going to have the same regard for individual life as a human being.  The fact that you give birth to potentially thousands of children from eggs within a few hours is going to give you a different outlook than a human woman who carries one, precious child and feel it growing inside of her for nine months.  Orson Scott Card explores those implications in those two novels.

At the same time I can understand why District 9 was so popular.  The common viewer simply did not see the trope of aliens being used as a metaphor for real racial problems before, so it is considered fresh and exciting to a mainstream audience.  To sci-fi nerds, this shit is small potatoes.  Greater minds have been using this trope for years in way more interesting ways.  So to me, District 9 did its job poorly.  True Lies, though?  I have seen a ton of action movies, and it delivers on every level.  What more do you want?  James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger didn't set out making True Lies with the intention of sweeping the Academy Awards and making everyone see a new interpretation of the human condition.  You watch it for Arnie, explosions, stunts one liners and watching bad guys die in cool ways, and they executed all these things very well.  This isn't to say one sort of movie is necessarily easier to do than the other, but they require different skillsets.  This is why you rarely see profound directors who are also blockbuster directors, and vise versa.  

The same goes for music.  Someone who has a deep love of blues or jazz is going to roll his eyes at some pop artist who tries to dumb it down for a mass audience in order to turn a profit.  Or someone who listens to a lot of music in general is going to crave for something **more**.  He or she will demand better lyrics, better composition, more technical skill.  The more you get into a hobby the harder it is to appreciate the casual stuff, just like anything else.  This can apply to anything.  A great football player is going to be bored if he isn't playing in the NFL against people who are his equals.  Again this isn't to say that one genre of music is inferior to another, but different skills are expected.  Prog rock demands a lot of technical ability, and indie is traditionally values the lyrical and experimental skill of the musicians.

Each song and artist has a place.  I would love to hear [Shots](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNtTEibFvlQ) when I'm going clubbing, but you would never sing this for a wedding ceremony unless the couple was very eccentric.

Considering it was a low-budget flick written by an unknown I'd have forgiven it for all it's flaws.  I'd probably have not bothered to finish watching it and moved on quickly to some more important thing I could do like cleaning the soot out of my chimney.

But given all the praise heaped on it, I was expecting much better.  Instead I got a massive crapfest of pretension.  It sucked.  Sucked sucked sucked.  I hated this movie with the type of visceral sickness that brews from within your gut like watching corpses floating along the river after a disaster hits a third-world country. I can even pinpoint the exact moment when I begin to hate this movie.  It's in the first few seconds with the overbearing sfx of the sunny delite jug that she is drinking and telling her dog to ""shut her yab"".  I can't say that after that moment there was anything, anything at all, that I found redeeming about this film.  The music, the story, the acting, the ending.  Oh fucking god the ending... ""laaa dee daa I just gave birth, gave up the baby, and now i go back to high school.""  WTF was that?
