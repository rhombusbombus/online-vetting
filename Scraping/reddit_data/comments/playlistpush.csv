Of course, it helps to have a label backing you (even small indie ones), as they often have connects at these DSPs and can get your song to the right ear. This is particularly how you see artists with little to no audience and nothing released get their first releases on editorials. 

That being said, I know people who’ve gotten placements on official playlists with self-released tracks just by pitching through Spotify for Artists (no equivalent for Apple yet). I can tell you with complete certainty that your profile on Spotify doesn’t matter all that much - the quality of your pictures, what you write in your bio, pretty much irrelevant. 

Your music counts. Make it good and release it as consistently as you can. When you’re pitching, give a good description of the track, say where you’re based, and feel free to suggest a couple of fitting playlists. 

Spotify used to be more of a level playing field. I remember when you could contact curators directly through google forms. Unfortunately not the case anymore, due both to over-saturation and a lot of major label involvement with DSPs. Not to mention them blindly favouring whatever is going viral on TikTok and Insta right now. 

Don’t sleep on indie playlists and blogs. I would not recommend sites like PlaylistPush or Groover (as someone who’s been a curator). Just not a fan, and seems pretty low value. Submithub works and is my favourite of these types of sites. Again, make sure your description and profile is up to date, and submit to the right places - blogs included. Write ups (and sites like Hype Machine) used to be more important, but they still hold some value. 

Best of luck, don’t stop what you’re doing just because of a lack of attention from Spotify and the like. This industry isn’t easy and thrives on personal connections. But it’s really about the music, don’t forget that. 

Hope that was of some help!

&lt;p&gt;30$ gets you nothing on PlaylistPush but it should. I should be able to do research, find ~10 playlists I like, and spend 25-50$ submitting to them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But on PlaylistPush you have to spend a minimum of 250$ and on Submithub most of the playlists aren’t even worth the time&lt;/p&gt;

We actually only just added the 4 credit tier about 2 weeks ago. Curators on SubmitHub earn more in total than they do on PlaylistPush.

I don't want this to be about charging artists as much as we can. It's expensive to be an artist today, and if I double prices I'm making that even worse. 

As for quality, do you mean ""more listeners""?  Because we put a lot of effort into the *quality* of our curators, and ensuring legitimate engagement. There are certainly some playlists that are bigger that aren't on our platforms, and that does indeed come down to $$$. But the difference between them and many of the curators on SubmitHub is that those big, expensive ones are obsessed with making more money, and we'd like to think our curators are paying more attention to actually curating high quality listening experiences.

All that is to say, you're right: if we increased prices a bunch, we'd get some of the ""big"" playlists. But many of this ""big"" playlists are doing sketchy stuff like selling placement, and I don't really want to work with them. Nor do I want to charge artists a lot more money.

I tried SubmitHub but only ever got rejected. I got tired of tracking down curators, listening to their playlists for like 30 minutes to make sure it was a good fit, writing a pitch to submit, and then still ultimately getting rejected so I decided I would just pay people to push my songs for me. No, I'm not talking about paying people to place me on a playlist (that's probably botted), but paying to have 3rd parties push my songs to legitimate curators.

So far, I have used YouGrow, Indie Music Academy, and Partnered Projects. There's dangers in using services like those too. In case you do decide to go this route:

YouGrow will 100% get you fast streams, but as someone mentioned, it was mostly Latin American streams, which probably fucked up my algorithm. You live and you learn right?

Indie Music Academy probably gave me the best results. I got on a great playlist, got some really good streams, got added to some other playlists from just being on that one, someone actually reached out to me on IG after finding me on this playlist, and I still get some streams on that song from people who found me on this playlist (not a lot but still more than any of my other songs). Couple of things about them though, they were only able to find placement for 1 of the 3 songs I submitted to them(refunds are guaranteed if they can't place you). And, it takes them fucking FOREVER to place you. Like, it took me weeks before they placed my 1 song, and then like a month or two before they told me they couldn't place me for the other 2. That's a LONG time. I didn't realize how long and thought this was normal until I tried Partnered Projects.

After Indie Music Academy kept being unable to place me, I tried Partnered Projects. They have somewhat of a co-sign from Andrew Southworth, so I figured they were probably legit. It only took them a few days to place me, and they were probably the best at actually placing me on RELEVANT playlists. The promotion I started with them is currently still running, so I am not sure how good the long term effects will be but I am happy enough with the results I want to use them again. In fact, probably going to use them for the song I just released AND the one after that. They also don't guarantee you placement, so they don't charge you until they have secured you a placement.

Anyway, paying for playlisting in anyway isn't a great idea (saying this as someone who does it) since as I mentioned it can fuck up your Spotify algo if you end up on the wrong playlists and also the long term benefits are questionable. While I got on some personal and smaller playlists from being on these paid playlists, I didn't gain any followers from it. So, lots of short term listeners, a few long term listeners of those particular songs, but no actual fans.

Only reason I still use this method is because this is the only method where I have seen SOME positive gains. I am currently promoting my new song harder than I have promoted ANY song ever (haven't paid to have it pitched for playlisting yet) by using ads on IG while also posting regularly on TikTok and YouTube. So far, the results have been abysmal (it's only been a week so far), so yeah...I can only do what I can until I start performing live, which will hopefully be the push I need to actually start gaining a following.

Kinda going backwards with my response, but what you're doing with the playlists is what I'm trying to do right now myself. That's one area I haven't really experimented with much until now. I've created a couple spotify playlists with mostly my production, and I'm working on getting people to save/follow them. I've never ran ads on social media but from what you described it seems like it can be cost effective. What I do is just pin a playlist to my Artist Pick and it picks up a few follows per day. My long-term goal is to get a few playlists with thousands of followers and then monetize them by becoming a playlist curator for PlaylistPush/SubmitHub/etc. As for your specific questions:

(1) I stuck with PlaylistPush just because that's the one I tried first based on reviews, and their playlists seem to be pretty high quality overall - no botted streams. I've made accounts with SubmitHub and SoundCamps but just never committed $$ to them. SoundCamps seemed like I was spending a LOT more to pitch to fewer playlists compared to PP.

(2) I kinda mix what I shop to rappers vs my self-published discography. Most of the stuff I shop for major label placements I keep off Spotify. I haven't run into any pitfalls as far as distributing the same beats that I shop to artists, BUT that's because I also don't use Content ID on anything. I deliberately keep everything out of Google/Meta Content ID because then everyone who uses a beat will start getting copyright strikes on YT/FB/IG etc. One of the main things that helped my beats go viral was YouTubers using my beats off SoundCloud in their videos. I allow all my beats to be downloaded for free and used with credit. I probably wouldn't be where I am today if I didn't have my whole catalog basically free on SoundCloud. When I sell a beat to a local/indie artist what they're essentially paying for is the extended HQ beat + stems.

(3) I think building playlists of your music is a great idea, as I discussed before, that's something I am working on. People tend to have short attention spans and usually can't be bothered to click through your discography and explore all of your releases in-depth. So putting your music in a more digestible format like a playlist I think would definitely improve your engagement and algorithmic scores.

My top-performing tracks on Spotify have popularity scores around 50%. In the last year or so, I've noticed a positive feedback loop occurring where my songs are heavily recommended to users in algorithmic playlists (mainly Radio), then they like/share/playlist the song, which causes the rank to go higher, which causes more engagement, etc. So I think I've finally got the sweet spot of Spotify popularity where the algorithm is recommending me to basically anyone listening to instrumental hip hop.

My wife and I have been really trying to dive into music marketing these past few months, trying to set up the momentum to hit algorithmic pushes on Spotify regularly.   


I have a few follow up questions you have time for em. And no worries at all if not.  


1) Have you tried other playlisting services such as SubmitHub / is there any particular reason why you use PlaylistPush?   


2) Do you distribute beats that you also sell or do you keep your discography separate from what you shop by rappers? Do you see any potential pitfalls for distributing beats for instrumental listening while also selling licensing on them to rappers?  


3) Do you think consistent algorithmic push could be achieved through investing in building deep playlists of only your music? I suppose successful examples of this would be Lofi Girl or organizations like ChillHop Music, Fantastic FM, and JazzHop Cafe. Do you see any pros or cons to chasing that sort of advertising model?  


I know these are kinda specific questions but I'd be very curious to hear your perspective. I have 295 beats distributed on platforms right now. I am also selling licenses to all of them on BeatStars. I really don't see many producers doing that, and so I'm curious if I am somehow shooting myself in the foot by also offering artists an accessible way to obtain permissions to these beats which they may be hearing on my Spotify.   


As you may have guessed, we are chasing a bit of a Lofi Girl, ChillHop Music, etc., type model where we are investing in Instagram ads (via facebook ad manager), and growing instrumental playlists which only contain my productions and collabs. We have been running very small campaigns ($100-$250) for the past 3 &amp;1/2 months. Through these ads, we've managed to find a few tracks that are getting pretty damn good costs per conversion (at least I think so, compared to all of the numbers in the tutorials we've been watching). Our most popular playlist is our ""Jazzy HipHop"" playlist which has gotten over 1000 saves with about $250-$350ish spent in advertising for it. I've currently got 1800 monthlies and we haven't hit any significant algorithmic push yet, though I'm hoping to make that leap soon. I've hit a a decent release radar push in the past without any advertising. Now, with some new releases that came out during the start of this last campaign, I've now got a few tracks approaching a spotify popularity score of about 20%. I predict that we might be able to hit a push with one or two more campaigns if we really go for it on the right releases with the right playlist. Guess we'll see.

(1) the music has to be good! playlist curators are picky. you can burn your whole budget and get no placements if you submit something they don't like. if you submit something wack, there is zero point to doing playlist pitching. so I only pitched my absolute strongest tracks that I knew had broad appeal. which leads me to the next point:

(2) target your genres well. don't just submit to ""hip hop"" and ""rap"" playlists, find every possible subgenre that could apply to your track and pitch to those playlists as well. also look up the names of subgenres in other languages (spanish, french etc) and submit to those so you can get the international audience.

(3) put a good budget behind it. $1000-1500 on PlaylistPush would usually get the results I was looking for. For that price I would usually get about 50 playlist adds, with each playlist having anywhere between 5,000-100,000 followers on average. I was targeting \~100,000 streams in the initial 3-6 months after the campaign with an eventual goal of 1M streams, which pays for the campaign at that point. So really you're giving the track a good initial ""shove"" to where it starts organically gaining traction just by more people engaging with and sharing the music.

A couple examples of tracks that I promoted with PlaylistPush

Blake Anthony - Flaus (2019) - 3.3M plays

Blake Anthony - Flawless (2019) - 3.1M plays

Kam Robinson - Drink More Water (2020) - 1.4M plays

Kam Robinson - How u feel (2019) - 1.2M plays

The initial playlist campaign on the above tracks has continued to pay off as they remain popular and generate significant income. And as I alluded to, not every campaign is a slam dunk. Some tracks do better than others, but that's just the music biz in general. You win some and lose some.

* These sites are essentially MLM for music.
   * You pay someone who sends your songs to a playlist organizer who gets paid to put a song on for two weeks.
* These playlists are passive. Passive is the key word here, meaning: people don't pay attention - it's background music. Yes you get a stream, but people are listening because it's called ""Cozy Cafe Vibes"" - they don't care about WHO, it's just a vibe for the background at a low volume.
* You have no control over where your music is grouped
   * They can throw you in any shitty genre playlist to ""fulfill"" your ""catered"" payment plan - have you ever listened to what you get accepted to? Generally it's trash, poorly mixed, poorly produced, etc.

SubmitHub likely will not get you anything crazy, it's a huge soul sucker and waste of time and money imo (2500 streams for $100?)

Imo **put that money into Google Ads for your music on YouTube**. In comparison, 2500 streams would cost about $30-40, depending on these factors:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These sites are essentially MLM for music.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You pay someone who sends your songs to a playlist organizer who gets paid to put a song on for two weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These playlists are passive. Passive is the key word here, meaning: people don&amp;#39;t pay attention - it&amp;#39;s background music. Yes you get a stream, but people are listening because it&amp;#39;s called &amp;quot;Cozy Cafe Vibes&amp;quot; - they don&amp;#39;t care about WHO, it&amp;#39;s just a vibe for the background at a low volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have no control over where your music is grouped

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can throw you in any shitty genre playlist to &amp;quot;fulfill&amp;quot; your &amp;quot;catered&amp;quot; payment plan - have you ever listened to what you get accepted to? Generally it&amp;#39;s trash, poorly mixed, poorly produced, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SubmitHub likely will not get you anything crazy, it&amp;#39;s a huge soul sucker and waste of time and money imo (2500 streams for $100?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imo &lt;strong&gt;put that money into Google Ads for your music on YouTube&lt;/strong&gt;. In comparison, 2500 streams would cost about $30-40, depending on these factors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can determine &lt;strong&gt;exactly&lt;/strong&gt; which artists, songs, keywords, genres, etc. you want to have ads alongside. And it will &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; show your music to those results.&lt;/li&gt;

I’ve run numerous campaigns with them. Last campaign was about $500 and resulted in less than 2,000 plays. This campaign was about $500 (maybe $400 with some of the discounts?) and…the results are terrible. The song was accepted on many playlists. I think it’s in the ballpark of 80-100 playlists. The vast majority of these playlists aren’t fake or real—they’re simply “dead.” I noticed curators on Groover (and SubmitHub) will join the site by submitting a major playlist (say, 10-20k followers). Then they’ll create smaller playlists with a few hundred dead followers (likely other artists who already submitted songs and were instructed to “follow playlist and stream it”). This is how you end up with an ecosystem that’s so ubiquitous now: tons and tons of playlist “curators” accepting songs that get nearly zero streams. This has happened to me *repeatedly*. Even when you get a “top curator” to accept your track, it rarely ends up on their “top playlist.” As I’ve said before, it’ll likely end up on their dead playlist. I say “dead” and not “fake” even though, at this point, it’s best to just call this scheme what it is: deceptive. And since it’s deceptive, it’s also fraudulent. Hence “fake” may be the appropriate term here. (“Fake” because you are led to believe a top curator with 10-20k follower Spotify playlist accepted your song when in reality that’s not what happened, and that’s far from what’s actually going on at Groover and SubmitHub.) 

I’ve run numerous campaigns on SubmitHub and can attest to it having a much lower acceptance rate than Groover with equally bad (if not worse) results. I don’t even know if I’ve managed to get a 1000 streams using SubmitHub from 20-30 playlist placements—it’s truly that atrocious. 

My music is also professionally produced, mixed, and mastered. (Our two studios have north of $300,000 of equipment between them—with all the standard stuff like 251s, 47s, 67s, hand-built 0.8 micron ribbon mics [$8k a piece], 1073s, 1176s, etc., etc. You get the point.) There’s nothing a major studio has that we don’t. Other than a Steinway piano, maybe.

Having said all that, I’ve run over $10k worth of PlaylistPush campaigns and can say that while the rejection rate is high on there (most will reject your song), if you get on any of their playlists, they’re the real deal. Your song will get tens of thousands of real streams and organic growth. That’s the positive answer to the eternal question all of us musicians ask ourselves: what to do? 

Having said *that*, I will also point out that even PlaylistPush had a playlist or two that used bots. (Which I obviously reported.) Bots are, more or less, everywhere.

You're also bang-on that independent playlists don't move the needle that much on a streaming basis, at least directly.

They try to push the booking aspect, but when I asked about their process there wasn't a lot of information. I've been able to book shows in my city just by visiting their website/ and or asking someone at the venue for the bookers email. And basically, they do the same thing but charge you monthly for it which could cause problems since they're unnecessarily in the middle. 

As for promotional services, a lot of their playlisting, sync, ect. seemed to be a shot in the dark. They don't have the same 'connections' as labels for getting placements on spotify's playlists, they basically just do submit hub for you or the equivalent of playlistpush.

Here's my thoughts:

PROS:

\- They did what they said they were going to do. My song was accepted by 4 playlists and reached 114,000 followers, and I received an email whenever the song was added to a list

\- The playlists look genuine based on Soundcharts data and my own research (curators had social media profiles, lots of Spotify profile followers etc)

\-  I received around 8k streams, just under 200 saves and a handful of follows. I'll let you make your own mind up on whether that's worth $200+, but I was happy enough with the results

CONS:

\- Customer support was slow and there is no # number, just email tickets. I did get a response to every email I sent, but at times I was waiting 2-3 days for a reply. In their defense my queries weren't super important, but if you do need to speak to someone urgently I wouldn't hold my breathe for an instant response

\- If you use them, expect to be hammered with promo emails afterwards. I don't want to unsubscribe as I will most likely use one of their offers again at some point, but it would be nice if there was an option to receive less emails rather than 2-3 per week

Overall I had a pretty positive experience and I will probably run another campaign on one my next releases. But just like PlaylistPush, SubmitHub etc I think success on these platforms really depends on how good your music is and how well it fits with their playlists.

It is definitely key to be aware as much as you can if the style of music you are making is a fit to the curators you submit to.  Ditto Groover, and I really, really like the fact you can most times see the curators top artists.  Invaluable really.  I also like DailyPlaylists, we have found some really great supporters adding us to playlists there as well.  And the amount we dedicate to submissions is very minimal, I would say $40 approx in a month.  The last 28 days we've been added to 75 playlists, mind you I'd say probably half of those are from people adding to their own playlists after stumbling across us .  But it is easy enough to identify bot lists, I think the key there is to have a dialog and interaction with the curators that add you as much as possible.  Little things like posting and tagging the curator on Instagram, following on spotify, YouTube,  whatever platforms you are able to do so.  We haven't ever tried playlistpush as the feedback from others has been much like described here.  And it's so important to not submit to playlists that don't reflect your audience that likes what you are doing.  If people are skipping your songs when they come on it just makes it appear like listeners don't like your song and spotify will see that and it can really kill any momentum.

We've used PlaylistPush twice, the first time with quite decent success, the second time less so, to the extent that we haven't used it again.  I think PP is ""quasi-legitimate.""  The two things that add to its legitimacy are (1) they don't accept all submissions, and (2) they make no guarantee regarding streams.  90%+ of the playlist companies accept all submissions and guarantee a certain number of streams - these are the obvious red flags of a bullshit bot shop.  These places are worthless; in fact, they are harmful.  I think PP can be a good solution for the right artist - and I don't believe they knowingly use botted-up playlists (but shit happens, of course) - but I think that bucket is pretty small and I don't think we fit into it.

Bottom line with respect to playlists is... there are no shortcuts unless you want to spent a LOT of money - like in the many thousands of dollars to hire a legitimate playlist company that will really work your music to the right legitimate playlists for your genre.  But unless the song really takes off (hits the algorithms, etc) - and the odds of this are very slim - this approach will be just another black hole for your funds.

I just reread the article.  I am not sure they really answered their own question in the title, but perhaps that is the point - it can be good, and it can be bad, depending on who you are as an artist and your personal views of the state of music consumption.

The author did focus on playlisting and specifically editorial playlists on Spotify.  Since they went down that road, I think they left out the large non-editorial playlist world and the abundance of playlisting middlemen, such as Submithub, PlaylistPush, Groover, etc.  It appears Spotify feels a bit threatened or at least sees the financial potential there as they recently started a non-editorial curator's playlisting pilot.  Very curious how they develop this, if at all.  An article from back in April if you are curious:

Exact same thing happened to me and I've actually made a few inroads with artist support.  I got over 1,000 fake followers and over 15,000 streams and over 1,000 song saves in one week and it completely blew apart my ""Listeners also like"" to artists who really suck and have 0 to 10 listeners per month.  This happened to me the beginning of October 2020 and in January Spotify finally removed over 1,000 followers after months of badgering on my part, and scolding on their part over using the clown I hired to ""promote"" my music.  I'm still trying to get them to remove over 1,000 song saves and the 15,000 streams to no avail.  They now they limit artists from seeing song saves to just 28 days, so I can't tell if they did anything.  

I had a really good back and forth with artist support in December on deleting my ""radio"" and ""also like"" sections, which they could do for me, but he advised against it because it may take a long time to get those back (if ever).  When I told him that I plan on pitching a new single release every 4 weeks this year and at least 2 full albums from my backlog as well, he advised me to hang in there and things will eventually correct themselves.  He also explained that the algorithm draws for several different areas in no particular order:

1. Monthly Listeners
2. Song saves to listener ratio
3. Song streams to listener ratio
4. Quality of streams (Tier 1 countries matter the most)
5. % of streams from your profile
6. % of streams coming from listeners' libraries &amp; personal playlists 
7. % of streams coming from listeners' public playlists
8. % of streams from Spotify algorithmic playlists
9. % of Spotify editorial playlists - the first 8 areas factor in to varying degrees for this, along with the song quality, performance &amp; production

I've released 2 songs so far (Dec &amp; Jan) with the next one coming at the end of Feb.  Good news is a couple decent artists finally came back to my ""also like"" section about a month ago.   I've tried facebook ads and they suck for me and my demographic (70s singer-songwriter/Classic Rock) 55+ folks don't do a lot of streaming.  I've also tried out PlaylistPush and Omari MC - and most of the streams came from South America on mostly bullshit playlists that have all of these shitty artists who are also paying for streams.  You'll get streams but the majority of the listeners will not listen to your music again.  No saves either.  But you'll get streams lol.  

After a whole year of delving into this world of streaming, I have settled on Jesse Cannon as the best source of info and consulting.  There's no magic bullet here, other than putting out quality music on a consistent basis!  So, I'd say hang in there, and continue the journey you were on prior to getting scammed!

To answer your questions: I make a playlist for several reasons, which is why I also want a perfect name for my playlist.   
  
First, I am very passionate with music. Especially Hiphop/rap and believe it or not underground techno (I live in Belgium and here techno is very in). music is like many something to isolate myself.   
Many 25+ (I'm not talking about you!) will not understand my taste in hip hop as many modern rap are less appreciated by ""older"" people.   
  
As such, I have received a lot of negative feedback on the playlist(name) when I promoted it on hip hop reddit pages. Nevertheless, I have a lot of understanding of the latest hip/hop and follow it hard.  
 In addition, I am personally making Hip/hop as an artist. a great playlist boosts a small individual artist directly.   
  
In addition, I know there is a big market for the music in the playlist. Rap/hip and pop are the biggest music genres and very much in with the youth (14-25). Still where I live, assume it's the same in the US.  
  
I also did my homework on how to make money with a more popular playlist. There are websites like playlistpush that will give you money if you have a good playlist. (For more info you should look it up as it is quite a process). In addition, the playlist can also work with placements, where artists pay a little to be on the playlist.  
The best way to make great playlist (in terms of followers) are ads. I am also willing to do that once my playlist preparation is done.

it will be really hard to do that as you have more eyes on social media, but its still possible

in case you want to do other stuff here is some ideas:

1. Collaborate with other artists that already have a little more monthly listeners than you have.
2. offline - print stickers with Spotify QR code that send them to listen to your music and put the stickers where you think is your audiences are
3. Playlisting - one of the best ways to get real streams and to trigger the algorithm of Spotify is playlisting, there are a lot of services like submit hub and playlistpush.  
I like to use [PlaylistMap.com](https://PlaylistMap.com) because you can find specific playlists by search artists that similar to you and pitch your song to the playlist curator, They also have a free plan..
4. Youtube ads - run some ads on youtube target only channels of musicians that sound like you with a teaser of the best part of your song
5.

Regarding using PlaylistPush for promoting songs I haven't tried that myself but seen how serious and professional they are from the other side (the curator side) I think this could be beneficial, and I will def try it out for my next release. I get a lot of songs sent to me that I review, and every time I hear a song that really rocks out, and has the right mood I absolutely add it to my list - so if I do it I am sure a lot of other curators there are also doing that. But the key here is: you must have GREAT songs, and also really good production. I think a lot if Indie artists fail here (especially when it comes to quality of production..). But that said you have tried that part of the process more then me, so I can't say so much more except it still is something I want to give a shot at..

Reagarding the other thing, the referral code, that is absolutely 100% real. Every curator gets one and you just copy it from your referrals- page. Then if some people post ""fake"" codes I cannot tell - but why would anyone do that? The whole purpose of these codes is they are linked to you so PP can see you are using them. And I mean there's not really any risk in trying the code. If it works you get a disocount, if it was fake you will get an error message when pasting it in your campaign - and then you probably don't move on :) hope this gives some clarity - and really wish you the best luck with your promotion wether you use PP or some other platform!

I'm sure some of these sites work really well for people so if you can test it for yourself then go for it. (though I wonder if they make their money mainly from people just giving it a go here and there rather than repeat happy customers...)

A lot of folks go into services like SubmitHub and PlaylistPush expecting to see positive results. But reality is that there are 10s of thousands of artists per day looking to promote their music in similar ways -- including the major labels (who use SubmitHub heavily). The ""supply"" of music way outstrips the ""demand"" of listeners. And on top of that, the average quality of songs is pretty darn high these days. Which makes it even harder for an artist to stand out and bubble up to the top 5%.

SubmitHub tries to make the connection process transparent and easy -- and we try to push you in the right direction -- but we can't actually guarantee any sort of success as far as creating a fanbase or breaking out.

indie artists are virtually invisible. there are many playlists that take submissions for free, but your chances of being heard/placed are hella low for any of them with significant plays.

then there are shit a shit ton of pseudo pay to place, like submithub and playlistpush, you pay to be considered by a huge amount of playlists and the playlists make a little bit of money to listen to your submission.

then of course, if a random individual puts their contact info in their playlist, you might be able to reach out to them directly and ask to be on their playlist.

even after all of this, any of those playlists may have bot follows and bot plays, spotify doesn't crack down on it cuz it doesn't affect their bottom line.

the playlist world is very difficult to navigate.

this playlist represent a small niche, LO-NY/Renaissance/Splayed, it has a couple different names. It is distinctly inspired by Some Rap Songs by Earl, the works of the sLUms collective and MAVI and some other folks. It is curated by hand, I know most of the people on it personally, they are from all over the US and the world, all of them are slept on like crazy, most are on very few playlists, and certainly even fewer with power. we will never accept money. and we will never over represent any artist and we will never place artists who are already popping or famous. this is for the under the underground in our niche.

if you run ads:

* change your campaign goal on “clicks” 
* create different content videos and test them
* run the ads on News feed

The quality of the feedback itself can vary but I still find any rejection and criticism to be valuable in improving not only your music but in how you target your campaigns.

I've just started looking into using chartmetric. I like that here you can find playlist curators by similar artist or song unlike submithub where you can only try to match by your genre. However, I feel like this ends up being a lot more time and work and sometimes you end up finding a playlist that just takes submissions on submithub anyway.

As marketers, we should always be looking for news ways to aquire fans. And we must also have a longer lense view than simply a few months. How do you turn someone into a listener, a listener to a fan, and a fan into a super fan. 

It's true that for most people, their budget and the times we're in limit folks to primarily digital ads. But outside of simply reaching new ears, think of ways that you can retain those new fans (email or phone number collection, follow CTA, saves or playlist creation, etc.)

A non-exhaustive list of other strategies to consider:

1) hire a 3rd party playlist pitcher (don't pay for playlists, there are reputable people that pitch for legitimate playlists)

2) pay to pitch your songs directly (via SubmitHub, PlaylistPush, etc.)

3) hire a publicist - would only recommend if you have a bigger project coming out. Features are becoming more scarce

4) pay for email newsletter inclusion in publication (NoiseTrade, Paste, Relic, AltPress, etc.) and/or website banners

5) collaborate with other creators on each other's channels (IG Live, Twitch, etc)

6) podcast interview - a publisct could pitch for this

7) billboard - around a bigger project. Blip is a neat option that drives the cost way down if you're constrained by budget

The only thing I would add is my opinion, which is that if people hear the music and like it, the social media following will happen on its own. I am trying more to get my release and future releases onto different playlists using legitimate services such as PlaylistPush where they still have to choose whether the curator likes it or not. And if I’m lucky and get onto like 40 different playlists and in each one of those 50 people decide to look me up on Instagram or Facebook or whatever and follow, That would be 2000 organic followers. And no idea how realistic those numbers are, could be drastically underestimated or overestimated. But if I am just focused on posting really cool pictures on my Instagram which I indeed have lots from traveling around India China etc., I’m not going to necessarily get a lot of music followers, if anything I’ll just get random travelers or something. So I think you should really just post whatever you want on social media, and then work on getting your music heard from as many people as possible with playlists or live performances or streaming etc.. At least in the beginning. Once you have like thousands of followers or something on Instagram, if you post something cool, and a few of those followers decide to share it with their friends, that’s how you can get more organic followers specifically for your music. 

Long story short, if you were trying to be an Instagram influencer, then all of your art/efforts need to go into Instagram.

You can find a lot of detailed tutorials for all of this stuff on YouTube channels like Burstimo.

Also, the more specific you can be about what you want, the better.  You ask ""is that enough?"" Well, depends on what your goals are, what your genre is, who your potential audience is, etc.

&gt;I personally got into Playlist Push as a currator. Will explain here my sight from a currators perspective. My experiences are very negative with them.  
&gt;  
&gt;First of all, I build an organic playlist with real followers. As I am an artist as well, I could see that I was getting a lot of streams from my own playlist.  
&gt;  
&gt;Unfortunately Playlist Push had a bug on my account. It showed that my playlist does not get any plays. I contacted the support and they provided me with screenshots, that I was actually getting decent interaction. They were quite surprised as well about this.  
&gt;  
&gt;I asked them on how they can help me to fix this problem on their website. Since then I never heard a reply back. I contacted them serveral times, asked kindly for help but I got ignored.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then they removed my account.  
&gt;  
&gt;So yeah that's my experience. Unfortunately it went like this for me. I've seen that also other bigger artists are on this site (don't want to mention anybody tbh).  
&gt;  
&gt;In your case I would focus, as described from [u/msav123](https://www.reddit.com/u/msav123/), on ads. You can try and gain knowledge with Playlist Push. If I would give Playlist Push a chance as an artist (which I wont), I would not expect too much.Yeah it is little experience and costs a lot, but I think the knowledge will be valuable. Then you really know, if that works for your music or not. But if something does not goes how you want and you have questions, be prepared that you will not get a nice treat.

If you have a bigger budget, I'd suggest [EDMNations](https://edmnations.com/edm-nations-promotion-services/). Unlike Artist Intelligence Agency, they will actually refund you if they don't pick you (these are for electronic music only I guess).

If you've just recently started, a few months maybe, then your main priority should be making good music.  I hate to say it (i don't hate to say it actually), I'm just gonna be real upfront about this, you have to actually make good music before bloggers and playlisters even consider you.  even once you ARE making genuinely good sounding music, you're probably going to be rejected or ignored by 90%+ of the bloggers/playlisters that you submit to.

This is also just another fact of life, if you've been producing for a few months, then you suck.  From an audio point of view, your mixes are going to be garbage.  And you know what?  That is fantastic.  Sucking at something is the best way to learn how to not suck at something anymore.  If you want to get yourself out there in music then you have my full support, but make sure you're getting your hours in before you expect any kind of payoff.  I've been producing for six years and I just now recently started publishing music.  And I still suck at mixing lmao.  You do not have to wait that long haha and I actually do not recommend it, I screwed myself out of a lot of time learning about the marketing side of music, but just get to the point where your music sounds good before you start to market yourself.

Now, if you have been doing this for a while and your mixes sound good, or if you just really insist on getting bad sounding music sent out, go on all the music subreddits you can find that match your genre.  there should be a ton of people on there posting their playlists.  feel free to drop a comment just asking ""hey, are you taking submissions for your playlist?""  this is seriously one of the best ways to do it, I kid you not.  Also, if you're willing to shell out a bit of cash, [submithub](https://www.submithub.com/) is pretty easy and reliable.  and if you've just got money flowing out of your ass whenever you go to take a dump, i would even recommend [playlistpush](https://playlistpush.com/).  But you don't get as many placements (in my experience, at least) from these paid services as you would by just asking people posting their playlists on subreddits, since the paid services are usually blogs that are making money off of their aggregation services and they tend to be pretty picky about what they let on their playlists.  People posting their playlists on subreddits are nine times out of ten just regular old joe schmoes.  and i don't mean that as an insult if it sounds like one, i actually like working with those people a lot.  they're just regular old dudes that have a playlist.

And I can not stress this enough, beware of the [dunning kruger effect](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/dunning-kruger-effect).  This applies to any new skill you learn, but especially with music.  the article is worded just a little bit r/iamverysmart like, but it's basically saying that it's when you're good enough at something to know what you're good at, but not good enough to know what you're bad at.

**Groover**

* Pretty much exactly the same as SubmitHub but focused on the French market.  
* It has a lot of the same blogs/playlists as SubmitHub (because they've systematically gone through our list and tried to sign them up).
* It costs EUR2 per submission, which is more than SubmitHub
* Their feature set is far less robust than SubmitHub's (I'm biased of course, but I've been coding daily on SubmitHub for 4+ years, and they're basically 1-year-old, so they've got a ton of lessons to learn about how to manage the submission process).
* So basically... a new competitor trying to copy the SubmitHub model, but with a long road ahead of them. Because they're less-known, you might have some success on there as there are fewer artists to compete against.

**PlaylistPush**

* Focused entirely on Spotify playlists.
* They have a minimum spend of $250.
* They provide a much more hand-held experience than SubmitHub. For example, they choose who to send your song to instead of you choosing. Some people might like this, as it's one of the more-involved parts of using SubmitHub. Personally, I'd argue that getting to choose who you spend your money sending songs to is certainly more transparent.
* A lot of their playlists are the same as those on SubmitHub, but cost significantly more. For example, Island Beats on SubmitHub costs 3 credits or ~$2.40 (our highest price tier), but on PlaylistPush I think they get paid $10+ for each song they consider. This has the disadvantage of being way more expensive, but... the flip side is that PlaylistPush has a higher approval rate. This is likely because there are fewer artists/submissions to compete against.
* It's also rumoured that PlaylistPush actually own a number of the playlists on their platform, which might be a bit of a conflict of interest -- it allows them to approve songs so that artists feel like they got some results.
* I don't think PlaylistPush has a way of tracking whether curators actually listen to your song or not, so it's possible for them to decline a song without ever actually hitting play. Maybe they've fixed this recently, but... yeah. Spotify doesn't allow streaming outside of Spotify, so I'm not sure how they'd get around that easily.
* Ultimately, they're still one of the only Spotify-specific playlist promo services you can sorta-kinda-trust. There are so many others out there running straight up scams, and PlaylistPush isn't one of those.

Ultimately this is a whole new area of music promotion, replacing an industry that was formerly dominated by publicity companies that charged $1,500+ per month for a similar service. SubmitHub's the most-popular and feature-rich of the available platforms out there. That popularity also means that you're competing against a lot more artists.

""SubmiHub and PlaylistPush - Extensive Review and Comparison - My experience and results - Why they are not a scam""

What kind of music are you making?

As for not finding enough playlist curators, I can tell you only about my own experience as submitter.

Yes, there seems to be quite a difference between the outlets you get shown, when you use only the free credits versus the paid ones.

But for most it makes sense, as they ask for three credits, so you will never get them displayed, with just 2 standard / free credits. Also, as a ""receiver"" you can chose to just get paid submissions, so these you also will not see with just standard credits. Besides that, I have the feeling there is an algorithm or something at work, which checks how much you have tried to submit a certain song with standard credits, but I cannot prove that. 

Anyway, if you wanna use submithub to its fullest potential, I guess you will need to buy a few credits, to take full advantage of it.

And read the very thourough post (see above) as this guy really reseached his receiver targets and wrote about this in great detail. I would advise you to do the same to get the most out of your credits.

Let me know if you have any further questions. My receiving account on Submithub is ""Radio Dark Tunnel (Shellshocked Radio)"", if you wanna check it.

The music industry is similar to the fitness industry, the more ignorant you are the more money they will try to make off you.


The nail in the coffin was that the only positive review of PlaylistPush I could find was in an article where the author *owned* PlaylistPush.


I got the results I expected from it, but thousands of listeners in Singapore, Thailand, etc? No. That's not legit.

When it comes to listens, the bigger the playlist the smaller the engagement rate.  
More so, many big playlists use follow gates - ***they force the artist to follow / like them before submitting his music***. This creates a huge gap between followers and listeners.   


I found a small trick to find quality Spotify playlists, it's slightly technical but worth it IMO.  


1. open spotify on your desktop.
2. open google chrome inspect (on mac cmd+shift+c)
3. find artist that is similar to you style wise and has 10 times your followers.
4. click his about page. for [example](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7cu3oi92lUe550VejeSeP3/about) 
5. go to the Networks tab in inspect and search urls that match *spclient.wg.spotify.com/open-backend-2/v1/artists*
6. click on it, you'll now see four tabs: headers, preview, response, timing. click on **preview**
7. click on '**artistInsights**' and click '**playlists**' 

You can see the top playlists this artist is discovered on WITH THE NUMBER OF MONTHLY LISTENERS FROM IT!   
`""name"": ""Berlin Electronic Underground"", ""owner"": { ""name"": ""xburglarcatx"", ""uri"": ""spotify:user:xburglarcatx"" }, ""listeners"": 127`

&amp;#x200B;

Now start hunting these curators down, they might be available through submission sites like [submithub](https://submithub.com), [mysphera](https://mysphera.co) or [playlistpush](https://playlistpush.com).

They further lost credibility to me when I found out they really push you to get other people to use it, giving you large % cuts off your next campaign for referring just one person. It's like a virus. After the fact, the only article I could find online giving them credibility ended up being written by the *owner* himself. Links to their website need to be filtered out here because I've seen people sneak referrals occasionally in replies. It is a pyramid scheme created to incentivize YouTubers to promote it so they can run campaigns on their own music by scamming their viewers.


Submithub is about as real ""bang for your buck"" you can get and is the most straightforward, the barrier of entry is just $1-3 for a guaranteed 48 hour response. This makes it highly competitive and saturated too though, so you really have to have your stuff together. 

I could have done 16 full blown SH campaigns for the price of one PlaylistPush campaign. The best part? SubmitHub goes out of their way to tell you if a blog/playlist appears fishy in any way. They will warn you that they suspect bot boosting, fake fans, purchased platform followers and so on. That way you can save your time and money. After speaking with Jason quite a few times via email, he is also pretty hellbent on making sure users get the most they can from their tracks. Future plans such as mood/genre match sorting and so on are a real possibility to make sure you are targeting the right people.

The music industry is very much like the weightloss industry. Everyone is trying to sell you shakes and pills that don't work, it's ridiculous.

This alone makes it infinitely better than 90% of the ways you send your music out into the void from emails to blog posts, because while you can know how many people listened (the play count on your soundcloud), you don't know WHO listened. Most music that's sent out never even gets considered by influencers, let alone makes it to enough ears in the market place to live or die on its own merit.   


As for the rest of them, depends how much money you have to burn. Playlistpush resulted in quite a bit of feedback, but the ratio of ""Love it, but not for my list"" to actual Playlist acceptance makes me wonder how well the pools you pay to submit into are curated.   


That story accelerates vastly when you bring in specific pushers. Note MOST publicists don't do specific User generated playlists, and definitely don't do Spotify internal. Spotify internal is all a game between connected people (ala the management mentioned in another response), distributors (but not like Tunecore, CDbaby, etc), and the algorithm. Playlist ads and listener to save ratios are a big trigger for those supposedly. Yes you can submit via the Artist dashboard now, but I'll standby for any case studies of it actually resulting in editorial playlisting.   


If you KNOW your stuff is good, and have the budget and the confidence to see if you are right, start with Submit hub making sure you know you are sending it to the right people. If that shows great results, I'd recommend stepping it up by pushing music videos directly to listeners via Facebook or Youtube ads. I'm not going to go through the how, but you should target fans/listeners of bands that you think their fans would like your stuff.   


If you get good results from that, then worry about finding management because you've either got to be remarkably talented raw potential, or bringing demonstrable value (which we can all see via your Spotify play trending, or these ad metrics) to convince someone to work with you who is any good on essentially long term commission.

And if they don't add it then your song isn't gonna get streams. The curators are not obliged to add anything. So i guess my advise would be, make sure your song is good before paying for this sorta service. It will be wasted on bad songs.

Sounds like your song was added to a playlist with false followers.

&gt; Kan Wakan arrive with a striking breadth of vision that immediately places them among modern pop’s most beguiling and inventive new artists. The Los Angeles-based group’s extraordinary debut LP “Moving On” introduced their ornate and enveloping amalgam of moody, hypnotic-soul, post rock, electronica and noir jazz, all reshaped and rearranged to create something both startlingly original and utterly contemporary. This darkly sensual and cinematic quality was championed by the ever-influential public radio stations, KCRW, WFUV and BBC Radio 6. 

&gt; Kan Wakan emerged in early 2012, the musical brainchild of composer/producer Crooked Waters who was recently named in LA Weekly’s ’10 Best Songwriters in Los Angeles’. The Bulgarian-born musician originally set out to create solely instrumental music inspired by his lifelong passion for classical minimalism. In 2010, Waters split time between writing orchestral music for motion picture and performing in groups around Los Angeles, whilst recording bedroom demos. These early recordings served as the blueprints for Kan Wakan’s forthcoming debut album. “Many roots of the music are inspired by moving picture and fiction. A lot of arrangement ideas usually start with a quick sentiment, and develop viscerally undocumented over some time before I feel comfortable enough writing them down.”, Waters says. 

&gt; Inspired by artists such as Massive Attack, Air and SBTRKT, the projects identity became deeply rooted in multiple collaborations. In 2011 Waters partnered up with guitarist / co-producer Peter Potyondy who helped push the projects vision forward. Together the duo spent the better part of 2012 shaping and molding the groundwork for their debut LP “Moving On”, which incorporates seamless integration of musical styles, from orchestral to r&amp;b, trip hop, electronica, jazz, folk and psychedelia. Waters says, “It took a very natural course as we spent a year or so experimenting with sounds in our rehearsal room and finding our groove while we searched for vocal collaborators and more like minded musicians to perform with live.”

&gt; As the duo built upon a truly variegated palette of influences, common musical themes began to manifest, including an epic but cinematic hypnotic-soul approach inspired by such icons as Bill Withers and Nina Simone. “Forever Found” – the band’s first fully fleshed track – proved the aural template from which Kan Wakan lit out on their exploration of what Waters refers to as “the juxtaposition of song and symphony.” The Independent UK calls it ” A glorious, swirling, joyous and notably non-ironic take on a time when pop could be grand and orchestral, as well as playful and arch”. The track soon became a local favorite at KCRW, “It’s rare that Jason Bentley will play a single track every day for a week on MBE, but the track “Forever Found” by LA-group Kan Wakan has earned that distinction”. 

&gt; Kan Wakan’s debut LP earned high praise from the editors at Rolling Stone, who called it” Dreamy, intricate stuff worth repeated-rehearings”, The Fader dubbed them “One of the most exciting acts of the year” and Buzzbands LA listed ‘Moving On’ as their #1 album of the year. The Daily Mirror added, “Impressive Arctic Monkeys-endorsed debut from LA-based newcomers”.  Yahoo Music named Kan Wakan in their 2014 ’11 Best New Artists of the Year’ wrap-up. Which proved LA Weekly’s 2013 prediction true, when they included the band in their ‘Artists About to Blow Up’ list.  

&gt; Having made an instantaneous impact, the band then spent the better part of 2014 touring behind their debut album “Moving On”, with stops at the ever influential SXSW and CMJ festivals, extensive touring in the UK including a performance at the buzz-worthy Great Escape Festival in Brighton. Later in 2014, Kan Wakan went on to support UK giants Royal Blood and the Arctic Monkeys on their respective sold out tours. Matt Helders of the Arctic Monkeys and fiancee Breana McDow, directed and starred in the bands latest music video for the song “Are We Saying Goodbye”. The band’s first single “Like I Need You” was selected as the theme song for HBO’s Game of Thrones Spring preview, which soon became an indie favorite on summer playlists. In December 2014 their track “Why Don’t You Save Me?” was featured in an episode of “State of Affairs”. 

&gt; Kan Wakan continued their stride into 2015, with a feature performance for CBS that aired every night for a week during the Late Night Show with David Letterman and announced that they are beginning work on their sophomore album, which will feature exciting new collaborations.

TWTLTRTD and DOAB are all Brendon finally have full creative control, which means more pop and less rock. They sound nothing like AFYCSO -- They sound like Brendon embracing his love for hip hop, EDM, and crooners.

I mean, can you really make that assessment that Pretty Odd is not a distinctive sound when it's spiritual follow up, Take a Vacation, further dives deeper into 1960s Garage Rock sound? Ryan was the primary writer and creative leader of PATD during those two albums, so I disagree that AFYCSO is ""the"" sound of PATD and that should be where the bar should be set in regards to as the band is as a whole. PATD doesn't have a distinctive sound.

Just the other day, I was listening to my playlist and She Had the World was followed up by Miss Jackson that was followed up by Nearly Witches and all three songs sounded like they could have been sung by three different bands. Like PATD broke up and Brendon just found three new bands to play for.

If the band did not split, I believe PATD would be pushing more into the Alternative Rock spectrum of music, taking cues from bands like Cage the Elephant, Arctic Monkeys, and Nothing But Thieves.

I do agree with you that the fans that were there for AFYSCO definitely weren't there for Pretty Odd. It's a complete sound departure, and the band, especially Ryan, brought that up constantly during the press run. You pretty much get his attitude if you watch their appearance at Live at Abbey Road. Ryan detested the idea of being paraded around as a teen idol and not as a musician. Pretty Odd was a deliberate move to sound different, to be respected as musicians, and to be known as a band worth the respect.

Here's what the website says so you don't have to give this company it's undeserved click:

&gt; When the Overwatch summer games rolled around again this year, many players were excited to be able to play Lucioball once again. The special game mode, which sees two teams of Lucios booping a ball into their opponent’s goal in a Rocket League-esque fashion, has returned for its second season, this time introducing a new Competitive playlist for those who want to take it seriously. The problem is, Lucioball still sucks.

&gt; I understand that there are people who enjoy Lucioball. That’s fine. I get how those who play a lot of Overwatch would appreciate the introduction of a mode unlike anything else offered in the game, which provides them with a break from capturing control points, moving payloads and screaming at Mei as she encases them in a block of ice. But it’s just a shame that this particular unique game mode is no fun to play. Here’s why I have such a problem with the special summer event:

 

&gt;**It’s painfully slow**

&gt;The main pull of Lucio as a hero is that he’s super fast, with him able to wall-run and leap between buildings in order to increase his momentum. The problem with Lucioball is that it takes place in a large, empty, open arena, meaning that the majority of the time is spent slowly ambling towards the ball and waiting for Amp It Up’s cooldown timer to disappear.

&gt;Lucioball effectively forces Lucio into a mode that is the antithesis of what makes Lucio fun. While you can run along the walls of the arena, most of the time you’ll be crawling towards the ball on the ground, with the size of the arenas making Lucio feel much slower than he actually is. If Blizzard reduced the cooldown on Amp It Up, or raised Lucio’s movement speed a tad, Lucioball could be fun, but as it stands it feels like playing a game of Rocket League but with the cars replaced by snails on roller skates.


&gt;**It lasts FOREVER**

&gt; Lucioball should be fast, frenetic fun. Instead, the arena size makes Lucio feel sluggish to control, while a 6-minute match feels like it drags on forever when taking the replays into account. I’d wager that the vast majority of its players haven’t bothered to make their way through its 10 placement matches, as those 60+ minutes could be better spent in its infinitely superior core modes. While 6 minutes wouldn’t be that long for any other game mode, its matches are typically so uneventful that by the time you’ve passed the halfway point, it’s already started to feel like a slog to the finish.



&gt; **Why soccer?**

&gt; Lucioball was never going to work. The wide and open arena doesn’t suit Lucio’s style of play, and it’s too derivative of the more fast-paced and exciting Rocket League. However, the concept of holding unique summer games with Overwatch‘s colorful cast of characters is a great one, and it’s disappointing that Blizzard hasn’t thought up something a little more exciting.

&gt; Even when keeping Lucio as the main hero, there are other options that sound infinitely more interesting than Rocket League 0.5. Players have suggested replacing soccer for volleyball, which would include a smaller arena that would make better use of Lucio’s swift reactions and would also be more in-keeping with the event’s beach theme. Or what about a wrestling mini-game, where the objective is to push each rival Lucio out of designated area? The most fun aspect of playing Lucio is being able to boop opponents out of this arena, so making a whole game out of this could be fun. Instead, we have Lucio slowly stumbling around while I hammer ‘E’ to try to make him go faster.

 

&gt;**Hit registration**

&gt;The hit registration for Lucioball was poor in its first season, and is equally poor in its second. Sometimes the ball doesn’t shoot in the direction you want it to, while other times it doesn’t move at all; I’ve had instances where I’ve hit the ball while it’s bouncing, and it has somehow propelled itself behind me. You’ll score goals that make no sense, and you’ll concede goals that make no sense, too.

 

&gt;**Just kill it already**

&gt;Blizzard including a completely new game mode for the low price of absolutely nothing is cool. Considering how much money everyone is plugging into loot boxes, though, it’d be a lot cooler if it was something better than Lucioball. When the summer games rolls around, players should be more excited to play this mode than they are to obtain new skins, but with Lucioball being so poor it’s no surprise that the majority were more tantalized by the prospect of dressing up Soldier 76 like a dad at a BBQ. At the risk of sounding entitled, I don’t want to see Lucioball make its way into Overwatch again. I want a new, better summer games mode, and I want better Lucio skins too, dammit!

No promo code or anything, just sign up and it's automatically there. I don't know how the prices are, but that would be the cheapest at least until you've used that $300 in credits. I don't have a link (I'm on my mobile), but it shouldn't be hard to find with a Google search. 

Next I would say scaleways €2.99 VPS I believe comes with 50GB of storage, and 200Mbps. (I'm going to assume it's 50, so if I'm wrong, the rest of the numbers below will also be off, but should still make sense otherwise) Which is very reasonable I would say. You can increase the storage in 50GB increments, but just a heads up, the first 50GB is the system drive, and whatever you add to it will be a separate mount point. So 100GB would be 2x50GB mounts. You would have to do some scripting of your own to utilize both mounts for the whole 100GB of space. I believe if you add 100GB (or mores or 150GB total), it is the 50GB system drive + a 100GB mount. Again, I believe this is the case. I could be mistaking and it may be multiple smaller mounts, but if so, you could combine them into a single larger mount. You can not combine them with the main system mount, it will always be separate from the rest. 

Also, I would suggest automating the upload/download to your own personal home server or computer, or simply use rclone to push it to google cloud storage, or another cloud storage service if you have one. 

The dropped frames shouldn't really be a problem. This isn't something I was originally aware of, but learned in the writing of these scripts. How the live streams work (at least in the case of all of these sites/scripts), is your computer keeps checking a playlist file which directs the player where to find the next segment of the video (a URL linking to a file). These segments are usually about 2-5 seconds long. If a segment fails to download, it will try again, up to 3 attempts (livestreamers default setting, but could be increased). The script will appended each new segment of the video to the end of the file creating one continuous video file. So you wouldn't miss just a frame or two, but rather a few seconds of a video if this happened. I won't say it never happens, but it shouldn't be common. If you're already running a computer at home and have even remotely decent bandwidth (don't need a ton, but third world speeds may not cut it), this shouldn't be a problem. 

If you're not going to be recording a ton of streams, you could even use a raspberry pi with a USB hard drive to save the streams with minimal power usage. You could even set it up on your network as a NAS and access the files on any computer on your network.

Bayonetta is a queen in the air. She accels at punishing off stage, so don't be afraid to go off stage with her when edge guarding. Literally all of her aerials are good. 

Nair is a wonderful way to punish opponents with bad recoveries. It's a big lingering hit box with decent knock back. 

Bair is wonderful too. I've already explained that it's a good kill move, but it's also good if you can read your opponent's recovery tol and get a stage spike.

Fair can gimp because it is a three hit move, and you can delay each hit. Against opponents with bad recoveries, this can be used to push your opponent far back enough to where they can't come back. Fair1 also combos into Witch twist of you feel like mixing in typical Bayo combos instead. 

Dair spikes. Enough said.
Seriously though, it spikes at her heel, so you've gotta plan it correctly. It doesn't take long at all to get the hang of it. If you get a good air dodge read, you can spike your opponent and come back to the stage since you can Witch Twist or jump out of it. 

Down Smash also spikes, be sure it'll hit when you send that out. It's got some end lag that can easily be punish with a get up attack at the very least. If you can ledge trump your opponent and get them to regrab the ledge, this move is perfect.

t5_3bbel,,,,1502979333,,,,,,,CompetitiveForHonor,,,,,,dlr27h5,,,0,,,,potatolord52,,,t1_dlqhs96,1,,,,,,"I will bother though. It's funny but I just feel sympathy for you, because you are correct in saying I act condescending. That's an issue with me that I'm trying to fix. I get really caught up in arguments if I think that I'm obviously right. The fact that I can't meet all these Internet people face to face and the fact that they at any point can just quit the argument and still pretend I am in the wrong is what causes me to develop prejudices. That, however, changes quickly when I realize that I am communicating with a person who isn't doing those things and who opens up, which is what you just did.

Regarding For Honor, let me make a few disclaimers about what level I am in. I am not some Korean machine. I can reliably block PK's lights on a read, and by matching her guard. However, I can't bear a fast-switcher that does the epileptic thing with his guard stance, or somebody who does the zone mix up. Her second light is hard to block but if I am feeling sharp or if I try hard and lean forward on the chair I stand a chance. That's fine and dandy balance for me. However, once we get to Orochi and his weak chains, I literally deflect the hits 100% of the time, because of how slow they are, and if I'm not an Assassin, I parry them. The fundamental issue here isn't lights out of neutral. Those are balanced the way they are. The issue is lights within chains. You know they are coming, so what will judge whether you parry them or not will be your reaction time. The issue is, everybody has a different reaction time. This means that people with low reactions will experience fast PK lights as a complete chance game, while professionals or prodigies with 100 ms reactions will completely deny it. This is a big dilemma of competitive video game balance. As a developer, do you force the players to take a chance game, make everything random and only use educated guesses, or do you make things reactable, and therefore learnable? Because making things learnable will mean that people will always strive to master the skills required, to then deny these ""learnable"" moves completely. Chances, on the other hand, treat pros and noobs alike, which can be both a good thing and a bad thing. I can assume that you don't like Tekken, but it is really important that you learn this from it, which is what's so genius about that game. It has a crap ton of gimmicks. Every normal throw in that game can be reacted to by looking at what arm the opponent grabs you with. Every character has around 100 moves, some of which are COMPLETELY reactable and don't have any mix up tied to them. Yet somehow, gimmicks in that game work. Do you know why? Because of the knowledge gap. Some pros spend years competing at tournaments and still don't know, for example, that King's figure four leg lock can be reversed. These are such easy things for a pro to figure out but the sheer amount of them means that literally nobody is capable to, hence why gimmicks in Tekken are implemented well and are healthy for the game. Even if somebody does learn them all, the amount of scenarios possible with these moves (in the hundreds) will slow their reaction time enough for them not to counter them. Tekken is literally pushing human boundaries to their limits.

Now, looking back at For Honor, you should start to understand why basing characters on gimmicks is simply setting them up for failure. There is no such thing as a knowledge gap in For Honor, and the gimmicks present are so few that everybody knows them. The only thing that still allows these gimmicks to work is the player's laziness. So what's the only other thing that keeps the battlefield balanced and fair for all characters? Chance. It forces even professionals to respect basic traits of characters. Chains right now are underpowered across the board, because they have strict ways in which they work. Furthermore, they aren't just things that affect all characters. Some characters depend on chains way more than others. The main example of this is Vanguards. They were designed for offense and momentum, way more than the other two classes, but unlike Assassins, their chains focus quite a bit on heavy attacks rather than lights, which is a good thing because heavies are designed way better than lights considering the game's philosophy. Now the challenge lies in making sure heavies become effective against turtles. This can be done by increasing the chip damage to really high amounts, making the commitment of attacks way more rewarding. Contrarily, Assassins rely a lot on light attacks in their chains. Because of how these lights cannot be feinted but can be ""learned"", they are currently completely countered by blocking, and in Orochi's case, who doesn't have many light/heavy mix ups, can be countered without risk by parries. Because of how the game is designed, and how meaningless gimmicks are, the only remaining solution to make these chains work at high levels is to make them unreactable. Pros will have to calculate the chances of getting hit vs getting a lucky parry off, and if the light chains can link into heavies, pros will also have to calculate the risk of trying to parry a light but getting hit by a heavy. Only then will these damn chains take some presence. Damage can be fine tuned based on all these chances, but at least they will give the Assassins an advantage for committing.

I apologize for the wall of text, but hopefully it will help you understand my point of view and why I suggest these crazy changes all the time. I frankly would be all for making two different playlists in the game. One for lower level players/average level console players, and another for higher level players who push themselves to the limits. The one for higher level players would include these drastic changes so it would still be balanced for the different characters. Competition and progress can truly alter the way games play out, and unless you overwhelm players with a knowledge gap or force them to go through chances, you will probably end up with a game in which half of a character's kit is useless because of the simple fact that it can be learned.

1,  Casuals

These are the players who run a loadout and subclass perks which in their mind is the most fun. It doesn't matter how good or bad the gun is, or what perks are on it, they just want to have a good time. 

It is great if they win, but if not then meh. They just want to have a good time and do not really care about mechanics or min / maxing.

These players are usually in 6v6 game modes but do venture into Trials. Most ""will check stats"" LFG posts are trying to filter out these players.

Success for Casuals is usually defined not by winning, but how much fun they had playing. 

2, Role Players

These are the players who want to play the game in a perticular way. I am one of them. I am a harassment style Vooper that uses a Sunbreakers build Sunsinger. What we care about is playing our way, not the most effective way, but our way. 

Another example would be the Fun Police, or the dedicated Sniper (despite all the nerfs), or simply a man who is married to his Handcannon. 

Role Players do care about min maxing and using the best perks and abilties, but *best* means *how it best fits our chosen role*

Role Players are found in every game mode including Trials, but tend to stick to either 6s or Skirmish.

Success is for Role Players is found not in winning, but in that sweet collateral voop or that awesome triple kill. IOW specific plays and not the outcome of the match.  

3, Winners

The Winner is focused on one thing, winning. The W is the entire point and the fun is found in achieving it. 

These are the players who run the meta, and focus on the best ways to win the match.  They may enjoy other, less competitive builds and weapons, but when push comes to shove they use the best of the best, whatever that might be at the time.

Winners are found in the more competitive 3s and they make up a large portion of the Trials population

Success for Winners is simple: a win. 

Trials is a mode where you progress through Wins, as such it is built to satisfy the emotional needs of Winners. 

When Casuals and Role Players enter what, for them, is a highly competitive playlist there is a bit of culture shock. All of a sudden they are ""penalized"" for not running the meta, and playing in a different way then the one they most enjoy.

Moreover Elimination is an entirely different beast compared to revive enabled game modes.

These 2 groups make up most of the complaints about the ""elitism"" or ""try hards"" of Trials come from these 2 groups. The Winners, for the most part, just swap weapons and go for the win... same as always.

The point of this is to try to explain that Trials is played by many, but for most of them it is not the same Destiny that they play everywhere else. Not everyone wants to change their habits and loadout to best succeed as to them, that is not their Destiny.",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6u1eb1,,,,,,,,,,,1502911692.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1504119038.0,,,

Best I can say is push ahead and don't fear failure etc, and yes, producing can often be rough. A long process of throwing random stuff at a wall and seeing what sticks, this is totally normal, I'd say, don't fight it, enjoy it, be playful and giddy like a child, think of those photos with babies that are totally covered in paint because nobody was watching.

If you are looking for gear to help you get unstuck, I'd say either just buy the first thing that attracts you and see what happens, or, probably much better, just don't, because it's very unlikely to solve the issue. No thing, will make you more creative, being creative is a mindset.
For example, if all you have is a microphone, some might use it to record just voice, others might use it to record anything and everything they can imagine, would cut down the waves to little bits and make a kind of custom build wavetable synth by just looping those tiny parts, reverse it, add tons of effect, chop it up, stick it in a blender for 5 days...
Trying to make an entire song with just 1 single sample is actually really fun and an excellent way to learn tricks, to break your limits and open your mind etc. It is crazy how much you can pull out of just a single sample.

I feel like all this is stuff more your issues, and the idea to buy hardware is just an excuse, a hope to find the right way.
There is no perfect piece of hardware, no perfect vst, no perfect daw.. 
What I and surely most people do is, a little research and then just bite the bullet. If it really does not fit you, you can sell, though I rarely sell things myself. For me, buying a synth that makes me go WTF did I just buy, just makes me excited and interested in what sounds I can pull out of it.

If you are the type of artist that wants to make music like music you know and love, I'd recommend to just look at your fav playlist, research the artists and what they use, and buy something like that.
Otherwise, again, just buy whatever interests you, or just don't buy anything, money is easily wasted.

Think about what you really want to achieve, what really is the problem here, solve that first, organize your thoughts, then I am sure you will know what step to take next.

I deleted Spotify and I'm going to give Apple Music a fair shake for the next month or so. So far my impressions are mostly negative, but it does do some stuff better than Spotify, like in general I like the white interface more for readability. It gets the obvious bump for being a first-party app, of course. Apple Music makes sifting through your own library easier than Spotify does because it just feels a little more simplistic (in a positive way); Spotify is constantly pushing you to new music so there's a thousand categories and tabs always.

But some stuff was a real reminder of why I left in the first place, like how slow it is occasionally to start streaming or the occasional bugs. They need to do some real work cleaning up the number of duplicate albums on that service; there's often three or four versions of the same album you have to sift through (and often it's exact clones, not just the difference between explicit vs clean or deluxe vs normal).

The For You section is unchanged from when I left the service a year or two ago and still presents an overwhelming amount of stuff in my opinion. Spotify makes it super easy because you have two curated weekly playlists and six curated daily mixes that are separated by topic so they're easy to just jump into. Apple Music on the other hand just has a dump of 16 recommended albums, 12 new release albums, 6 artist spotlight playlists and 6 playlists of the day. It feels like there is zero curation involved. Spotify feels like they put a ton of work into making the weekly and daily mixes something you'll truly get a lot of value out of and are built for you, while Apple Music feels like it's just pushing a ton of random content at you rather than making something for you specifically.

Also, a lot of the artist playlists I used to love haven't been updated at all since I left. Like the Tyler, the Creator one. They haven't updated his ""essentials"" playlist in two years but he's had a lot of stuff out since then. It's like that with a lot of artists.

I don't know. I still want to give it some time, and it fits with my mood lately of wanting to rely on first-party apps as much as possible, but it's admittedly kind of discouraging going back and seeing the same flaws that drove me away in the first place still present. I can't point to a single thing that's even really changed in the meantime except now apparently there's a ""My Chill Mix"" playlist now that hasn't shown up for me yet.",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6qqyrh,,,,,,,,,,,1502900736.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1504113585.0,,,

Destiny is such a casual game. It was a game made from the ground up to be accessible to players who had never even played another FPS game. When the game first came out, DTG was flooded with posts of people who came from WoW or other RPG's and wanted to try a RPG like shooter. This and it being one of the largest community games on console has lead to a pretty diverse population. A lot of dads play this game with their kids because its made for both audiences. A lot of players who are not dedicated or devoted PvP players play this game. This becomes a problem when Bungie decided to make skill-based match-making a priority. What happened was a large part of the population who is average, started to see relatively high success rates compared to the experience in other shooters. It created a mindset that these average players were actually above average. Then, when these players enter the Trials playlist, they encounter win-based matchmaking. They start to be matched against people who are higher skill and who are playing the game harder than they are used to. The protective blanket was gone. They see players who are using abilities and weapons that are the most effective, and they see this as being unusual or ""try-hard"". I have been called toxic after games for using stickies and once even received hate-mail for using flashbangs because ""They are so broken."" The player assumed that **I** was doing something wrong because **he** was doing what he always did and it didn't work. People think that players playing to win is toxic and elitist because they spend their time playing against people who aren't. What they don't realize is that in Trials they are playing players who only know how to play the game in the best way. For example, when you looked at the weapon distribution for usage in the crucible, for a very long time after they were nerfed into oblivion, auto rifles were the most used weapon class in PvP. If you asked anyone who played the game at a high level, hand cannons were dominant. People using the auto rifles were being matched against other people who didn't know any better, and because of this they never improved or learned to adapt because they could see success without needing to put in any effort. Joe Schmo enters trials with a bad gun and a poorly built subclass and gets smacked. The only reason this doesn't happen to him all the time is because SBMM protects him. If he were exposed to good players outside of the trials playlist, then he would see that the blame for his failure lies on himself, not his opponent. So a lot of the salt and the ""get rid of trials all together"" attitude is from people who just want to be protected from players who are better than them all of the time. They want to be good without having to get good. 


There is not more toxicity or elitism in Destiny than there is anywhere else. The reason it gets complained about so much is because **a much larger percentage of the players feel that they should be part of the elite,** and when they are pushed out of their comfort zone, their first reaction is to blame their opponents for what basically amount to ""being too good."" It also doesn't help that for the elite players, Trials is the place that they can go to find the easiest games. I am not a high-skill player, but for the most part, my first 3-5 matches on a trials card are way easier than my average control or clash game. So the experience is at the same time easier and more difficult for players coming from the other crucible playlists. One side sees a fun, sometimes competitive, but mostly casual playlist with cool rewards and a fun game type. The other side sees a nightmare of indomitable foes and unattainable prizes. One of these sides is much larger than the other, and so their voice is louder, but it is very much the wrong way to look at it. If you aren't good enough to go flawless, its ok. I played for two years before I scraped my first lighthouse and you better believe I tried my ass off for months to get better and earn it. It was extremely rewarding to put in time and effort to succeed and to try and take that away is insulting to the people who were in the same place as the majority of players and actually put in the effort to improve. The difficulty is fine, the community is not toxic, and the rhetoric coming from people who hate trials because they find it too difficult only highlights their lack of understanding of the game mode and the intricacies of Destiny's PvP. You don't hear anyone saying that the raids are ""too hard"" or that ""everyone should be able to do the raids and if they try and fail it should get easier."" The reason is because people don't come into it with an inaccurate perception of their own skill. SBMM really did a number on the ego of a huge part of this population and it shows when they get the training wheels taken off.


The response to anyone complaining about trials should be the same: **You don't like it? Leave. You aren't good enough? Get better.** That covers 90% of the complaints that I see.",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6u1eb1,,,,,,,,,,,1502896872.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1504111697.0,,,

The first thing I'll say is - let yourself grieve. Acknowledge what you're feeling, and feel it. Don't try and push it away.

With my last breakup I tried to pretend that everything was fine, after about a week I had an awful stomach ache, I took a day off work, I slept in, ordered breakfast, cried, watched TV, cried, ordered lunch, cried, watched TV, ordered dinner, cried, watched TV and eventually managed to sleep.

I felt *so much* better the next day, not over the breakup, but just better. So if you need to take a couple of days to sit at home and cry and feel sorry for yourself, do it.

Lean on friends for support, it's not bothering them, it's not a hassle for them, this is literally what friends are for. Have them over, throw on movies or have a board game night, talk about your feelings if you want to, but have a support system.

You're going to feel like you have a lot of free time on your hands, that's why you need a new hobby or something to occupy your mind. My first proper heartbreak I started to write a play with some friends (fun fact, those same friends now run the theatre company that Jack Gleeson AKA Joffrey from GoT now works with), after my most recent break-up I took up cross-stitch. It's quite repetitive so it almost became like meditation for me, but then had nice little gifts and decorations to give to friends after I completed a project.

I know the 'delete facebook, hit the gym' trope is a 'thing', but it's a valid thing. You don't need to become a gym-rat, but exercise *really* helps with mental health. Make a playlist, either wallow in your misery and make the saddest soppiest playlist you can, or go for an angry one, or just one filled with songs you like, stick on your headphones and go out for a walk. You don't have to run, you don't have to lift weights (unless you want to, of course!!) but just even going for a slow stroll outside for 20 minutes will do so much for you.

Delete her off all your social media!!! Delete her number. Out of sight, out of mind. You DO NOT want to be getting updates about her life, or questioning who that guy is in her photo (probably her brother, or a close friend, but your brain will make it into something 'bigger'). The less you know about her, the better.

I know it sucks, but she's done you a kindness, ideally you should be in a relationship with someone who's just as crazy about you as you are about them. If she wasn't head over heels for you, it's a good thing she let you go, now you can find your person who will make you happier than you can imagine. It will happen, it'll just take some time.

Which is saying a lot, because I'm also not much of a TV person (like, tbh, when I do ""multifandom"" edits, I haven't actually seen 90% of the shows/movies I choose to include in the video. I'm a fraudm I know). At first, the show was corny as hell, but I started to really get into it at around season two. I tend to always favor morally ambiguous characters, and The 100 sure doesn't have a shortage of those.

And, ooo, I really like the last one. It's so chill. I can see myself writing to it. In fact, I let the whole playlist play while I read. But my music taste varies. Sometimes I listen to embarrassingly up-beat pop songs, sometimes I listen to stuff by Saltillo, which has a dark vibe to it (""A Hair on the Head of John the Baptist"", ""Gatekeepers"", and ""A Necessary End"" are probably my favorite Saltillo songs). 

And you're right about setting unrealistic goals and the discouragement that follows. I have major depression, and ""work out"" was always the advice people gave me to feel better, but I could never reach the goals I set for myself. Like, I have the upper body strength of a half-melted marshmallow, so when I set goals like ""do 50 push-ups a day"" or whatever, it kind of just set myself up for failure. Basically, I never really looked at it as a gradual process; I mostly just wanted to feel better immediately. But I'm hoping that I'll be able to psyche myself into a mindset like yours this time around and the short-term goal idea might help with that. I'm kind of mad at myself that I never thought to do that before. It's usually just been: ""be able to do xyz workouts in x-number of days"" or ""lose 20lbs (which is my end-game goal) by such and such date"". 

But, yeah, your comments do make sense. I actually never took my eating habits (which are bad, haha. While I don't eat much, what I do it can't be considered healthy) into consideration when trying to work out. They were always separate issues. In fact, at one point, I would tell myself ""I could eat xyz if I work-out for x-number of hours"".

That's why you don't see actual Tesla owners asking for Android Auto, Carplay 

That said, as an owner, I do keep a list:

- Display phone's battery and signal status on the main screen, possibly right on the phone icon.

- Allow us to turn on/off hiding the top app navigation row in map mode. 

- New Driving Controls Page
	- Checkbox to enable automatic steering changes (Set to Comfort below 15 mph)
	- Acceleration: Range - Standard - Sport (102.5%) - Insane (115%) - Ludicrous (125%)
		- Range limits acceleration and top speed to help extend driving range. (Max draw is capped at a specific kw level)
		- Standard is what we're driving now. This is ""100%"" of standard power.
		- Sport is available on all cars and pushes the hardware as hard as possible. This should give a small performance boost to legacy cars, plus a little placebo effect.
		- Insane / Ludicrous list percentages of power above Standard to empahsize that you're overstressing the components. Also, going to 115% power (or whatever the max is) is psychologically attractive.
		- Max battery power would be a larger red/green striped button below the acceleration setting. It becomes available (ungreyed) when you select Ludicrous. When you push it, it flashes to indicate that the battery is coming up to temp, and might have a progress bar on the button. 


- Display/Dismiss Phone notifications as well as send/recieve text messages via the screens/voice. Include an option to enable only when there is no front seat passenger, or to send the notification only to the driver's screen when there is a front seat passenger, for privacy. 

- Power mirrors should fold when the car enters Park and unfold when it enters Drive or Reverse, but not when summon is enabled. The current practice of unfolding during powerup, then folding for summon, then unfolding again causes needless wear on the equipment and looks dumb. Leave them folded until it's possible to need them.

- Automatically raise and retract the steering wheel when the driver's door opens (or when the car is in park) for easy ingress/egress. 

- Battery management while plugged in: Currently, after the vehicle is charged, it sits, plugged in but not pulling power from the connector for anything. Vampire loss, climate control and use of the on-board computer can reduce range (consuming battery energy) even though it's plugged into a power source. It should be able to maintain its state of charge, even with the climate control and on-board computers running indefinitely in this configuration. This can be easily fixed with the following software changes:
	- When plugged in, turn off Range Mode on the climate control and Power Saving Mode on the computers, and fold the mirrors.
	- When plugged in, frequently check the State of Charge vs the set level and re-start charging if it's low in case climate control is consuming a lot of power.
	- When Supercharging or plugged into a supercharger, leave the computers and climate control turned on. Monitor the battery state and resume charging if necessary.  

- Entertainment System (General):
	- Fade in/fade out volume changes (esp. during play/pause) rather than just blasting it.
	- Cleaner audiobook support via USB (MP3, M4A and M4B formats)
	- Do not resume USB playback on vehicle power up. It screws up audiobooks. Resume all USB audio in a paused state.
	- Support playlists on USB storage (M3U and PLS)
	- Add selectable Volume Normalization, Loudness EQ setting and customizable EQ Presents for different types of music. 
	- Do not unmute the radio when the car starts/doors open.
	- Allow me to favorite songs/artists from the metadata of FM/AM/XM/Bluetooth audio sources. 
		(Favoriting a song or artist triggers a streaming media search for that song or artist so I can favorite it.)
	- Automatically download album art for all songs, XM channels, and radio stations, and include a means to clear that cache for troubleshooting purposes.

- Streaming Media (Slacker/Spotify): 
	- A ""Refresh"" button to log out and log back in to refresh favorites and playlists without having to type in credentials.
	- Allow us to favorite specific artists or albums, not just specific songs.
	- Allow us to pin the song title, album or the artist's name and play only songs that match the pinned criteria. 
	- Warn us if the service doesn't have a license for the requested song, instead of just playing something else.
	- Support for selecting of 128/192/320 kb/s streaming rates.
	- Pre-cache the next track when the current track is completely loaded to smooth out problems in poor signal areas and support seamless playback.
	- Allow creation/editing of playlists and ""Fine Tuning"" of channels (See Slacker's website)
	- Support for Audible audio books
	- Some kind of generic or API support for other streaming services like Spotify, Pandora, Google Play Music, iTunes, Amazon, Youtube Red, etc. (They all have very similar control schemes)

- Phone: 
	- Add a Tesla tab to the main screen's phone app to call Tesla Roadside Assistance, Tesla Customer Service, the Nearest Service Center, and Emergency Services (911 in the US)

- Navigation:
	- Allow me to share addresses with the car from a phone (without creating a calendar record) 
	- Default to ""Fastest"" route, not ""Shortest""
	- Allow me to choose which route to take if alternate routes are found
	- Allow me to add enroute stops via the console or from a phone
	- Optional POI overlays and data from Zillow, Yelp, Loopnet, etc. 
	- Show my destination's StreetView photo when I'm getting close. 
	- Allow me to select if I will charge at my destination or not. If I plan to charge, I can roll in at a low SoC. If I don't, it needs to ensure that I arrive with enough power left to get back to a known charging location.


- Voice Commands: 
	- ""Google"" or ""Search"" that uses the internal browser to look up a word or phrase on Google.

- Browser:
	- Use a modern browser with reasonable performance

t5_2qh1i,,,,1502821796,,,,,,,AskReddit,,,,,,dlnwgwr,,,0,,,,Iquitsmokingtoday,,,t1_dlmwvxa,3,,,,,,"Sorry it took a while to respond, busy day at work.  Also, I apologize in advance as I'm writing this on mobile.

But there's really no trick to it, its pretty much what's been repeated on here regarding safe driving.

If you start getting drowsy, stop for 5-10 minutes.  

It helps to drive with friend.  That way, both of you can keep an eye on each other.  Even if your co-pilot starts to doze off, its best to stop for 5 minutes and stretch the legs, walk around a bit.

Driving with a friend is also beneficial as conversation can help keep each other focused.  If you run out of topics you can always start making light of other drivers / towns/ things you see while driving. Humor always helps.

Listening to something on the radio and varying helps a lot too.  Between local radio, personal playlists, audiobooks, stand up comedy, or podcasts there's plenty of audio media to keep yourself interested.  

Keep something to drink and snack on continuously.  Caffeine definitely helps, but too much sugar and caffeine will lead to an energy crash or a pounding headache.  1 caffeinated drink per turn driving and the rest water was my personal rule for the trip.  

Be interested in the area you're driving through, even if it is miles of cornfields in Nebraska.  You're surroundings can be a great topic of conversation with your driving partner.  

I smoke and occasionally dip (unfortunately to both) but those helped keep me busy and focused.  Bubble Gum or sunflower seeds are the similar but healthier alternative.

Giving yourself things to check on periodically is another way to keep focused on the task.  Since we were going to be on I-70 for the majority of the trip, we didn't need the miles-to-turn feature on so we switched it to elevation.  It was kinda cool to see how much we differed in elevation after 30 minutes of driving on a seemingly flat road.  On a related note.  PAY ATTENTION TO SIGNAGE.  Especially while interstate driving.  Most of the time the signage will let you know road when the last gas/rest-stop/restaurant is for a certain distance.  And you don't want to miss the ""Last gas for 220 miles"" sign with a quarter tank of gas.

Most importantly though, if you start to feel drowsy, or even catch yourself dozing JUST ONCE.  Stop and walk around for 5-10 minutes, it helps a lot.  If you still feel tired after stretching out for 10 minutes, take a 15 to 30 minute nap, that usually helps out a lot as well.

There's no benefit of pushing past your limits especially if you're not used to long distance driving.  My first convoy in Iraq, when I was a boot, 3 months fresh out of Motor T school, I was exhausted and ended up falling asleep while driving, for a solid minute.  I woke up driving down the shoulder of the road.  Luckily I didn't wreck or hit a roadside bomb, but it scared me enough to start taking driving a bit more seriously. 

Situate yourself adequately, but not comfortably.  A slight discomfort in your environment helps prevent fatigue and day dreaming.  I'm not talking freeze yourself in the middle of winter with all the windows down, or giving yourself back problems.  We used to joke (and my conspiratorial side somewhat believes) that they design the cabs in military trucks to be super uncomfortable to be in for a long time to help keep the occupants awake.  

All these things help fight drowsiness and road hypnotism.  Staying engaged inside your car and your immediate surroundings helps keep you on task.  Once there's silence other than the drone of tire on concrete, people retreat into their heads and start thinking of other things than driving and they either stop paying attention to the road or start getting drowsy.  Stay local, don't start thinking about work back home, or what your destination is going to be like.  Stay local and in the present.

Being personally accountable, especially when driving by yourself is imperative.  Nobody is going to be impressed with how far you drove if you fall asleep and wreck.

Edit:  I forgot to explain how to identify road hypnotism.  Well you can't really, road hypnotism is suddenly realizing you have no recollection of your driving, but you can recognize the situations and factors that can lead to road hypnotism.  If you work to minimize those factors and stay cognizant of the likelihood, you're more likely to prevent it or catch yourself in a state of 'hypnotism' sooner than later.  Another reason why driving with a friend can help.  If your friend is driving and you look over and he hasnt blinked in ten minutes, he's not driving the car, he's back home doing something else.  Talk to him, snap him out of it.",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6tmf0b,,,,,,,,,,,1502820429.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1504084526.0,,,

&gt; Kristen Ford is notoriously distracted.  This art school drop out has come of age in an era of instant messaging, youtube clips, ipod shuffle, text messages, internet radio and frequent Uhaul rentals. A genre whore, Kristen Ford jumps from Rock to Folk to Reggae to Pop and never sticks around for breakfast in the morning. Kristen Ford sings and writes songs, but she’s not exactly a singer songwriter. She plays acoustic guitar but is comfortable on bass and loves pushing her tube amp to the limits on electric. She has played with the likes of Erin Mckeown and Sonya Kitchell and in settings from the holy Whatley Chapel in Massachusetts to beer soaked dives like The Empty Bottle in Chicago. 

&gt; Ford’s sound is derived from the message of Ani Difranco, the experimentation of Radiohead, the grooves of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the ear candy of Tegan and Sara. Live sets with her 3-piece band feature distorted guitars, disco dance beats and reggae breakdowns, rounded out with hard-hitting pop hooks. Acoustic sets, while more intimate and song based, are focused on energizing the crowd and leaving them with melodies to mull over after the show.

&gt; At age 21, Kristen Ford has already lived in 5 states, primarily splitting time between Western Massachusetts and Chicago. Her band Plaid on Plaid is well traveled in the Chicago club circuit, and she helped to spearhead CHARC (Chicago Artist Collective) events that showcase emerging visual artists and musicians.  Utilizing alternative venues, these events create a safe space for everyone’s enjoyment. A biracial (black and white) lesbian with progressive politics, Kristen strives to have a positive message in her music and move people towards acceptance and action, Kristen aims to create memorable performances, to craft eloquent songs and to engage the listener. Her music is universal and not a soapbox for a political, racial or social agenda. Kristen will continue to reach new audiences, to push herself and to revel in today’s underground arts movement.

&gt; Her debut record “Filthy Nasty” was recorded in the fall of 2008, at the Institute for the Musical Arts and was produced by Lee Madeloni and June Millington. This ten track LP is predictably unpredictable, each song bringing a new element to the listener. Filthy Nasty will be independently released in early 2009.

&gt; As Kristen’s career unfolds, she hopes her audience will continue to drink too much coffee, multi-task, wait tables, relocate, sublet, accessorize, text while driving, wikkepedia things, rescue cats, and whatever else can be done to keep them distractedly optimistic and ready to move as fast as this folk rocker from Chimassachugo.

&gt; Press for Kristen Ford:

&gt; “ An unexpected, eye catching blend…music is a fusion of varying elements, like heavy guitars and dance beats… creates music that speaks to everyone: gay, straight, black, white, whatever. [Kristen Ford] strives to be a new breed of rock.”
-Windy City Times April 2008

&gt; “Sounds like she was born with a Guitar in her hand. A Multi-instrumentalist with dozens of songs under her belt, she effortlessly glides between pop, rock and roots.”
-Diva Magazine October 2007

&gt; “She’s an ambitious girl, who plays guitar and records as a solo artist. Her live sets are never boring… this is how a girl with a guitar builds a fan base”
-Columbia Chronicle December 2006

For about 5 minutes. The only time it worked was when I held my pocket open and raised my voice while staring intently at my pocket. The fact you can get siri to listen to you while you're holding the home button and it's in your pocket is not a feature, it's a bug. 

Siri isn't supposed to be able to work in your pocket at all. It's to prevent pocket dialing. That's why when the phone is in your pocket even if it's set to ""Voice feedback - Always on"" Siri still won't say anything when she's in your pocket. She's not supposed to work in your pocket.

I'm very glad you mentioned headphones! See, there's a setting called ""Allow Siri while locked"" and if you turn it off, you can't turn siri on at ALL while the phone is locked. TouchID, siri headphone button, double tap airpod or otherwise.

So assuming you're using said headphones, and you have ""Allow siri while locked"" enabled, then you CAN do, ""Hey siri, play music"" while the phone is locked. I just did it with my headphones just now. I literally said, ""Hey siri, play music"" and music played while the phone was in my pocket without having to touchID or unlock anything.

I even got GPS instructions home without having to unlock my phone via apple maps.

Now lets assume you want to open spotify, so you push the button on your headphones for siri and you say, ""Open spotify.""

Now what? How are you going to pick a song? Pick a playlist? If you were already listening to something on spotify, you didn't need to unlock the phone to play where you left off. I downloaded spotify and made an account just to test it. I started spotify, played a song, locked the phone, and I could pause, play, skip, etc without unlocking the phone.

Lets say you want to open Waze, or google maps. Unfortunately Siri doesn't natively support those so you'll have to enter the address yourself. If you want to interact with your screen, you will have to pull the phone out of your pocket and FaceID can authorize your face faster than rise to wake can turn the screen on.

All of **this** the stuff you're complaining about. Will be a non-issue.",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6spc3m,,,,,,,,,,,1502747933.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1504060411.0,,,

My advice would be to keep your overhead low, use free publicity whenever possible (calendar listings, local press and bloggers, flyers and local stuff) and have the bands play a lot of gigs until they're a kind of a known fixture of a local scene.  

Hopefully that scene has a local college radio station type thing, and send the CDs there and to review places until you have some local cred.  Don't expect too many sales so use kunaki or something where you can order and deliver the music online or via CD/DVD and youtube at low cost via third party outsourcing.

Now, the playlist of the college station is often the ""bubbling under the radar"" type music that breaks out when the algos see it is getting the same treatment across several markets (they report their playlists to CMJ and other online aggregators of info these days like Next Big Sound). 

At some point you need an army of fans to push the album on Spotify or somewhere that the algos will think it is bubbling up... and then it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy to some degree in terms of mentions, PR, and stuff.

That's the business end.  The other end of it is... try and make great music with words that people respond to.  That tends to mean... have a good lead singer, the rest can fall into place.  :)  Good luck!",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6tnrx9,,,,,,,,,,,1502746215.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1504059668.0,,,

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/614c4cf58070455883f1b61e68327915.png)  

&gt; Fountains of Wayne is an American power pop band that formed in 1995. The group (not to be confused with Fountains) helped spearhead the 90s power pop revival and achieved breakout mainstream success with the 2003 Gold-certified album 'Welcome Interstate Managers', which spawned the smash top 10 hit ""Stacy's Mom"". Having achieved critical acclaim throughout their career, the band consists of Adam Schlesinger, Brian Young, Chris Collingwood, and Jody Porter, last releasing 'Sky Full of Holes' in 2011.

&gt; The band's name was taken from the name of a lawn-ornament store in Wayne, New Jersey, not far from Montclair, New Jersey. That city is the hometown of the band's bassist and cofounder Adam Schlesinger (the store has since gone out of business). According to  Songfacts, there were prominent fountains there.

&gt; The concept of the band was formed by Schlesinger and Chris Collingwood. The two first met as freshmen at Williams College and began playing music together in various groups. The two eventually went their separate ways with Collingwood forming the Mercy Buckets in Boston and Schlesinger forming Ivy in New York City. The duo initially set out to work together in the early 90s under various band monikers (including ones named ""Pinwheel"" and ""The Wallflowers""), and recorded a full album's worth of demos in 1993. Although never released, the ""Pinwheel"" demos are widely bootlegged by fans and display a very different (yet still earnest) version of the pair's songwriting, though several songs from this period would be re-tooled and appear on later releases.

&gt; After failing to get their project off the ground, the two met up once again during the mid-90s and formed Fountains of Wayne. A demo eventually landed the two a deal with Atlantic Records and in 1996 they released their self titled debut. The album spawned the singles Radiation Vibe and Sink To The Bottom which received airplay, but it was Schlesinger's song entitled That Thing You Do! which became a hit being used as the lead track for the Tom Hanks film of the same name. ""That Thing You Do!"" also brought Schlesinger an Oscar nomination and an RIAA gold certification for the hit soundtrack.

&gt; Along with guitarist Jody Porter and drummer Brian Young, the band toured the world extensively behind the album playing alongside bands such as The Smashing Pumpkins and The Lemonheads.

&gt; In 1999, the band returned with their second album, Utopia Parkway, a loosely-based concept album about life in the American suburbs in the late 1990s. Unfortunately, a much-changed radio climate left little room in playlists for Fountains of Wayne's snarky power-pop, and the album, along with its three singles Denise, Red Dragon Tattoo, and Troubled Times, sank without much notice. The following year, the band was mostly quiet, contributing a song each to a soundtrack and a compilation (Too Cool for School to the ""Scary Movie"" soundtrack and California Sex Lawyer to the third installment of the International Pop Overthrow series). They were dropped by Atlantic soon thereafter.

&gt; The band spent much of the early 2000s in seclusion, occasionally rejoining to record or play an occasional gig, but mostly Schlessinger was focusing on work with Ivy and Collingwood founded an alt.country band near his Western Massachusetts home called The Gay Potatoes. In addition, the band wrote and performed the theme song to the popular Comedy Central program ""Crank Yankers,"" and contributed a cover of The Kinks ""Better Days"" to a tribute album. The song was also later featured prominently in a scene of the 2004 remake of ""The Manchurian Candidate."" During this time, the band's stature only grew in indie pop circles, raising expectations high for the release of their next album.

&gt; Welcome Interstate Managers, Fountains of Wayne's third record and first for Virgin, was released in June of 2003. Preceeded by the single and video for the Cars-ish Stacy's Mom, the song became a surprise top 20 hit on the strength of its video--a send-up of 1980s teen comedies like ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High""--which starred Rachel Hunter as Stacy's Mom. The video went into heavy rotation on MTV, pushing the album to become Fountains of Wayne's most successful with sales exceeding 400,000 units.

&gt; Like most bands who have a major hit driven by a clever video, follow-up singles did not fare as well. Despite a similarly-clever video for Mexican Wine, the single failed to take off after MTV banned the video due to a scene where two underage girls lip-synch the words to the chorus, a reference to drinking tequila. Third single Hey Julie initially made only a minor dent on AAA and Hot AC format stations, but it was later featured in ""Scrubs"" and other TV shows and grew in stature over time, becoming something of a sleeper hit. During this time, the band also wrote a series of short, almost They Might Be Giants-styled songs for a short-lived VH1 TV series titled ""Hey Joel!,"" which was written by critic Joel Stein. The show was canceled before it aired in the United States and the songs were never released.

&gt; The song named ""Red Dragon Tattoo"" was also featured in the 2004 series ""Kingdom Hospital"", based on a novel by Stephen King, that aired on BBC. 

&gt; In 2005, the band issued the 2-disc Out-of-State Plates, a compilation rounding up the band's various import-only B-sides as well as several new songs. Maureen was released as a single yet received little attention.

&gt; The band's fourth proper album, titled Traffic and Weather, was released April 3, 2007. One abandoned track from these sessions, a novelty throwaway titled Monster House that was written for the movie of the same name but not used, was leaked in advance of the album's release via the band's MySpace page. ""Traffic and Weather"" met with typically strong reviews but fewer sales than its predecessor, although the single and video for Someone to Love made a minor impact.

&gt; In early 2009, the band embarked on a small tour where they began to debut some new songs from an as-yet-untitled fifth album. Progress was slow, however, and other than some scattered shows the band dropped almost entirely out of view for two years. In late 2010, the band announced that they were now without a label but that they had completed their as-yet-untitled fifth album, which they were hoping to release sometime in 2011 once they found a new label. During this time they gave away one new free song via their website. Song of the Passaic was written for an NPR segment using a poem about New Jersey's famed, industrial Passaic River.

&gt; In May 2011, the band has announced that their fifth album, Sky Full of Holes will be released on August 1st, 2011 on Lojinx in Europe, August 2nd, 2011 on  YepRoc in North America and on Warner in Japan. Two singles were released in advance of the album itself: Richie and Ruben in May 2011, followed by Someone's Gonna Break Your Heart the following month. Like their previous releases, the album garnered critical praise from a variety of publications. Jill Menze of 'Billboard' called the release ""excellent"", describing it as ""a new minimal sound with a poppy, folk-leaning flair.""

&gt; After a six-month tour in support of the album, the band quietly went defunct in favor of side projects. Although they never officially broke up, the band has been completely inactive since sometime in 2012. Read more on Last.fm.

half my nugu playlist comes from random live stages (often because there's no decent release to be found, sadly).

[A.C.E - Cactus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VYJKjyRjik). I didn't really care about the song at first, lol (though it is good enough as far as Nugu boygroup songs go) but their fucking outfits on [that one Music Bank live stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmEA6BSLSY8) *hngggggg*. It's all thick male thighs in almost-underpants and it's beautiful. 

[This DGNA  Show Champion stage of Rilla Go!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQhI-z8PNrc)  back from 2014  has so many views from me lol. Everything about it is terrible - the styling, the dance, the vocals. But I still love it for some reason. [The actual single release is bette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSodkvHMgxc)r, a bit, but still cringey as fuck. It's awesome,

S.E.T's [Nallari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUWp2UpManQ) is a great europop/trot mashup that I [first heard on M Countdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VG5atTO771c). Their rapper is literal fire. She is so good, seriously. And she is also pretty damn gorgeous. The dude is fun too. And they have these goblin grim reaper background dancers that are so good. I love their staging.

[A-Seed - Shake It \(흔들어\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZHcQm1Nhy0) are so nugu, that the song doesn't actually have an english title lol. I first [saw this Migliore fancam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKMfML1lc7c) (drighk does the best sexy girlgroup fancams, y'all can fight me on that!) and got hooked by the saxophone sample in the song, lol.

[ONF are pretty good on their live debut stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9bHdFVEdoo), and I was so surprised by it, that I went out to find out more about them lol. [The song is pure 80s cheese and I love it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQlMI0n10VY) 

Anybody remember [M.Pire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WopzApzaa4I)? Their live stages were so good. I miss these these kind of songs that push seventeen thousand things into one tune, lol. 


also, for funsies [this BTS - I NEED U cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJoEIOE1cR8&amp;list=PLNNolYHrgrAjxjIbKskwO6v3oQf3bvkXK&amp;index=34) by nugu group Iz gave me a whole week of life recently. I need to follow more groups who play actual instruments lol.

A number of things. The cost for a 256GB iPhone will exceed a 128GB+128GB combination (for no real benefit because you don't need NVMe or UFS2.1 for photos/music/etc). Most people will generally use only 64GB on a daily basis, but being able to store more is never going to be a bad thing in the 21st century. As for myself? I've used this iPhone for half a year and I have 16GB worth of photos (after some light curation to also approximately 4500 photos). I only have 2GB of music, but that's because Apple Music apparently refuses to cooperate with me (I store locally), otherwise my music playlist on my laptop exceeds 50GB on its own (different tastes by day/weather/mood). Do I need that on NVMe? No. Do I want access to it? Yes. 21GB or so make up my installed apps and app data, but the only reason THAT isn't bigger is because I wiped my phone a while ago because it was dicking about (it still is) and only carried over photos and music. As for books? Damn... I have about a gigabyte and that's with storing most of them exclusively on Dropbox. I've already had to tone down my usage because I can easily see myself exceeding my 64GB limit... Considering 256GB wasn't even close to enough on my laptop (I ended up with 500GB spillover into an external hard drive), is it really that unbelievable that people may want to carry around 64GB of apps and 256GB of photos/music/misc? Plus, it makes it a hell of a lot easier to move data between computers. 

There are some cases where removing features will offer definitive benefits to consumers. Removing the floppy drive? Yes please! Removing the physical keyboard? Why not. Removing the cord? Debatable, but with certain benefits.

There are other cases where removing features are costly to consumers. Leaving only USB C ports? Welcome to either the world of dongles or the world of buying new cords/computer accessories. Removing the ability to replace RAM/SSD? Welcome to paymore, getless. Thinning the device ANOTHER millimetre? That's 300mAh you just cut off, now buy our battery pack case! Removing the headphone jack? Sure, Bluetooth isn't bad, but WHAT IF I WANT TO PLUG IN MY DT990s? I use the dongle? But... I tape on the dongle? But I plug in to my laptop too, and that doesn't have Lightning. Lack of MicroSD card slot or dual SIM? Sure, I don't NEED it, but the only cost is a slightly thicker phone. Frankly, I don't care if my phone is a whole 20 grams heavier and half a millimetre thicker. 

I can see the appeal of simplicity, but Apple's implementation just doesn't call out to me. I don't want to compromise on a headphone jack. I appreciate Samsung's implementation of MST in Samsung Pay, and I likewise appreciate Apple Pay for pushing forward Tap to pay. I appreciate being able to adjust my snooze time and expand storage at my own will, and yet I understand that the plethora of options may be overwhelming for some. Sometimes the lack of options means you don't have to worry, and that's respectable. Personally, I can't live without a headphone jack and I'm starting to see the appeal of a MicroSD card slot. A second SIM for travelling has become appealing, as has the ability to set my snooze time away from 9 minutes. A larger battery has become a necessity, and an eBook reader that doesn't glitch out would be appreciated too. Of course, YMMV and that's perfectly fine too, but for my usage I doubt I will be coming back to Apple, and I will happily criticize Apple for their pursuit of thinness just as I will happily criticize every Android OEM for THEIR pursuit of thinness. If Apple could give me a 4000 mAh battery (or ballpark) with their optimizations, I would never leave. 

Whatever makes people happy, right? It just doesn't seem right to call out other fanboys as though the fanboys on your side don't have the same issues. How about just let the fanboys duke it out and we can have civilized discussions elsewhere, yeah? I just wish there could be one damn phone that didn't compromise where I care... But perhaps my expectations are too great.

Now lets see how the iPhone 8, Note 8, LG V30, Xperia XZ1 (or XZ1 Compact), and Pixel XL 2 do against each other. It's great fun.",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6tlcr9,,,,,,,,,,,1502727854.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1504050952.0,,,

We had been dating for a year. It had ups and downs. The good times were the best I had. The bad times were breaking. Still, it was the most connected I've ever felt with any partner.

There had been red flags but I remained hopeful, from promises and signs of change. I recreated our first date on our 1y anniversary. We had the same restaurant, same table. I made sure the same waitress would be there. I wore the same clothes. After dinner we went home and I proposed with a custom Magic deck (http://essentialmagic.com/decks/View.asp?ID=986636). She said yes.

Infidelities uncovered and likely more I didn't know haunts the next year. Each time finding truth was like pulling teeth. Reluctant half-confessions in the face of evidence.

Then came the custody battle for my daughter. In court, with GAL, and to the outside world, we appeared as the perfect, loving couple. To be completely honest I don't doubt her love, as much as she was able, and mine never wavered, even in years since. In private though she continued to cheat on me, repeatedly, and lied about it, more half-confessions, and later blaming me for her infidelity.

Our wedding date was pushed back with each violation of trust. For a couple months I even called it off. Still we were engaged again because I could not see a future without her in my life. We had the dress (custom Vera Wang, a gift from her wealthy mother), the venue (park where we took engagement photos), the food (friends with food trucks), ... We spent nights talking abour our wedding music. I secretly made playlists. So many songs so painful to hear now. 

Then I learned her infidelity never stopped, as worse than I thought, and that she loved him, this man she had been cheating with since the beginning. She told me to my face, as her fiance, that she loved another, yet wanted to marry me. ...

I was done. Every part of myself I gave her, every bit of respect I swallowed deceiving myself by believing her promises to change, it had left me raw and broken. I distanced myself from her and her children. I gave her back the ring I wore (I found it only fair for both of us to wear engagement rings. Fuck the patriarchy). Everything that could be canceled was. Everything that could be returned was. I don't know what happened to the dress in the end. I asked her to move out and told her I wouldn't stay in our home when the lease was up.

Her response was getting wasted and cheating on me more, ""to feel wanted"" in her words. I wanted her as much as breath, but only one of those was keeping me alive while the other was killing me. Her best friend stayed with us for a couple weeks, trying to get us back together now and again. ""Two people who love each other so much shouldn't be apart."" In pain I replied, ""You don't break the heart of one you love, hide it, then blame the one you love for your choices"". In hindsight it wasn't fair to say she didn't love me. She just couldn't be faithful.

Months passed and she had a stint of short relationships before getting together with someone she had been flirting with throughout the years of our relationship. She seemed happy. They both got into AA. They seemed a good match. Despite being broken by her, I still loved her, still love her today, and was happy to see her smiling again.

We found things belonging to each other and exchanged them. She sold me back the Magic decks I had built for her. We talked about the kids (all from past relationships). We saw each other Christmas Eve and exchanged presents and hugs. I cried feeling her in my arms once more.

I drove down to Oregon with my daughter to spend Christmas with my mother. On the 27th I received a phone call from my ex's son. He told me her boyfriend found her unresponsive in her bathtub. She was in hospital but had no signs of significant brain activity. My daughter and I came home, then said our goodbyes to her in hospital. Her mother ended life support a couple weeks later after dozens of brain scans provided no hope.

It was years ago now yet I still love her. I tried to be in another relationship but it failed. I hadn't grieved and I'm still not done grieving. Some day I'll be ok though and my life will move on. Until then the radio and old moving boxes are minefields finding joy and heartache in equal measure.",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6tei79,,,,,,,,,,,1502643155.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1504022505.0,,,

t5_2qixk,,,,False,,,,,,,halo,,,,,,dlikj4b,,,0,,,,TheLittleMoa,,,t3_6t7n9q,16,,,,,,"&gt;Many of you know that the MCC has not been updated in almost 2 years. The bugs and crashes still going on. 343i and MS did not take care of the MCC anymore and now they are trying to ""fix"" it by just making the old games BC. But why? What is the goal with this?

This really isn't the case. It's nice to have your old games available on the Xbox One without having to spend X amount on MCC. 

&gt;There are some classic players left that still playing H1, 2 or 3 into dead and others moved to the MCC (since they thought that it would be a better experience), but the problem with BC Halo titles is that MS thinks the classic players complain to much about making a game that has a ""classic experience"" feeling, instead they are trying shut up the classic player's mouths with the same games for over a decade. It's this what the classic players want? Not. they want a new Halo game that is not a ripoff from other franchises. A game that evolves without being changed completely in it core game-play. A games that follows the blueprint of the 3 classic games and not Reah.

Cool, keep pushing for that. I'm right there with you - I'd love to see how a classic Halo title would perform in this day and age since we haven't had a proper one in years.

&gt;In the lastest community update it's mentioned the testing of these BC Halo titles: ""Good news: back-compat is still a thing! The Xbox BC team is still churning away on getting the titles prepared for public consumption on Xbox One hardware..."" This is the most hypocritical statement ever, because 343i and MS could just outsource the MCC to get it fixed, but the BC games getting outsourced and tested instead??? Come on!

The difference being that the Xbox BC are a team at Microsoft, who handle ALL 360 (and soon to be OG Xbox) titles coming to the Xbox One. They are being paid already to test and bring these titles forward. 

The people capable of fixing MCC are all over the place. I don't even know how many different teams, studios, etc worked on the game but I have a feeling getting them all to come back together and restart/resume work on it would be hell. 

Here's something ske7ch had to say the last time this was brought up:

&gt;The BC games are something managed by the Xbox BC team and has nothing to do with 343 or MCC other than the fact that we want to work closely with them to make sure those BC titles are the best they can be before they get released. MCC is an internal 343 product and responsibility, BC titles are 99.9% driven by a different group elsewhere at Microsoft. It's not an either-or scenario.

Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/6rguf4/in_this_weeks_community_update_we_talk_about_an/dl6g6iw/

&gt;They could easily make the MCC into a standalone titles for XBO and fix them.

If it was this simple, it would have been done years ago. The problem we have now is MCC is a delicate house of cards and with any attempt to change it, it could become even more unstable. Here's what ske7ch said around four months ago:

&gt;MCC is a complicated house of cards, assembled by multiple disparate internal and external teams, and even if it can be cracked open there's no way that every fan issue can/will be addressed.

Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/5zu4d0/halo_community_update_burn_baby_burn/df2gvmo/

Now you ask - why not just restart from scratch and work on it non-stop until it works fully again? I say - the returns for this just isn't worth it for them.

I'm with everyone else when I say - MCC shouldn't have launched like it did and work should have continued non-stop until the product was working 100% in every aspect. That's my stance.

The reality is - if they did decide to focus everyone on fixing MCC (or even outsource it, again), would the cost of that be worth it for the very little players who would come back and play it again? 

I personally don't think many players would come back. No matter what you do, the name ""Halo: The Master Chief Collection"" is tainted and it will always been seen negatively. 

&gt;Final thoughts: I still believe that making the old Halo games BC will not revive the golden era Halo had back in the day,

Absolutely - anyone thinking this is expecting far too much. It won't take long for people to notice how aged these titles are, especially Halo 3. Black Ops 2 was one to perform well because it was much more modern and had a great set of tools and worked decently. Halo 3 was a great game but it had a lot of issues that will become very apparent when played often in 2017.

&gt;but I believe in a new Halo game that is based on the old formula with focus on the sandbox, good storytelling, beautiful artstyle, full with all time Halo playlists, split-screen, LAN, customs, working theater, tasteful Forge, not ADS, not Spartan Abilities, not sprint, not microtransactions, will make Halo great again.

Right there with you. Although I'm confused what you mean by a tasteful Forge and I can tell you right now that microtranscations won't be going anywhere - they make far too much money. Only way those are going away is if you can get people to stop spending money on them - which isn't gonna happen.

Wendy Endress and other faculty members can be seen having conversations where they're concerned about being allowed to leave, which is always circumvented by ""you're free to leave and nothing will happen to you, but that shows you're not supportive of People of Color"". There's clear intimidation there, but probably nothing illegal. I have no idea where the legal line is, but it seems fairly tame in comparison to what I would normally think of as kidnapping.

To be honest, I didn't see very any clear and obvious threats in the protest footage. There were threats that the protests would continue to disrupt the school unless the admins did the work requested, but that's not a threat of violence. Chanting ""Black Power"" and ""2 4 6 8 This time you can not escape"" also aren't threats. Feel free to link me with a timestamp if you know where a real threat came out: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV8ajpBgPg4hANX8zyqI-sCsjS9rGJ07Z

As far as the other stuff the authors bring up, much of it is very ""well, that's true, but..."". The best thing out of this article for me is that they're finally going openly to the press. Before it was just the one NYT op-ed writer, and everyone else apparently wasn't even trying. With the exception of some very limited articles about the shooting threat, the only national-level sites covering the story for a long time were very right-leaning publications, and much of the online discussion was incredibly hostile. The local news was doing a decent job, but the coverage was pretty much completely one-sided and hostile. If I had been a student protester there, I would definitely have concerns for my safety. Even that playlist I linked just now and spread online both here and on 4chan, I made to remove any link to student Facebook pages where I ripped the videos from. There is no doubt that there are plenty of people hiding their legitimate racism with the rallying call of ""free speech"". 

It's also important to note that these protests, though angry, loud, and at times frightening, were **almost completely non-violent**. To my knowledge, only one guy got physically pushed during the Limp Bizkit Chalk incident. And is a little push like that really ""violence""? Well...

1. Agree 100%

2. during the queue process have the MM algorithm have a checker that check the highest MMR player per team and compare it to Lowest MMR player per team and if it greater &gt;500 SR difference cancel that match and keep search ( Probably link it to MMR rather than SR for decay accounts) 

3. Have a Solo q MMR and Flex q MMR  (debating on separating the queue) - but add zero decay to Flex and keep the normal decay standard  on solo q  
  -Flex Q is for players that can't meet the demand of playing 7 games per week and for player that want to queue up with their lower level friends in a semi competitive environment 
   
 -During games Player that look up player profile in games, only show the MMR that players queue into (Flex q show Flex q MMR and Solo Q to Solo q MMR) - Avoid demotivating / flame players based on a number  

4. Debating on how active this playlist would be / what motivation would a Top500 team have to play this playlist ( Maybe use it as a qualifier to gain access to Overwatch Open / Contenders) 

5. It a risk , but idk if blizzard willing to take that risk 

6.Add a Elite League after GM - Uncapped that SR limit + Increase the minimum amount of SR gain per match 
 - Motivate players to push higher up the ladder and to not get demoralized for gaining only 2 SR 

7. Finally to give reason for player to reach top 500 or top 50 - Add a tangible reward outside the game like a exclusive OWL team jersey with your alias on the back

It's not exactly much of a playlist, but I've been wanting to get one together for a while so this is probably a push in the right direction. There's a half dozen other Joy Division songs I could add, but for the sake of variety I left them out. Three is pushing it already.

Additionally, you get a lot of people who are simply looking to pubstomp. You can do similar stuff in games like LOL but it's hard because your ranked mmr and normal/pub mmr get equalized quite a bit so if you're high mmr in ranked, you're normal mmr also ends up pretty high.

This sounds awesome.

&gt; Benchy refers to himself as a pro.

&gt; Even Frothy refers to himself/his group of friends as pros in their tutorials. It's not how to wall run like a competitive titanfall player. It's how to wall run like a pro.
And here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_JwtN654z8

So, this is what I meant by tutorial vids. ""Like a pro!"" is a saying, I think you're being a little bit picky on this one? I don't know, I don't see that as sincere, I see it as a phrase that gets commonly used.

Same with the other vids which I put in the category ""I just solo carried my pub team I'm so pro!"" Clearly, they're not ""pros"" because as far as I can see there are no pro players.

&gt; This literally means anyone that actively plays anything like a ranked match. I don't even see a ranked option in TF2 so maybe I'm that shit that I haven't unlocked it, but it seems like it doesn't even exist... which means competitive players don't exist?

This is part of what I said in my original comment. The game is trying to be a casual game, by not including any of this. It doesn't include a competitive playlist, or anything, it shipped without private match options, the people who wanted decent people to play with and against had to organise their own thing with the PUG discord group and get that up and running. *That* is where the competitive players are, they had to make their own playlist because the game didn't provide one. So they're practicing, organising matches, and playing in tournaments. Is it not fair to call themselves competitive players? Just because a playlist doesn't exist *inside* the game?

&gt; One of the major issues I have with you and your buddies' video is that it makes an assumption that everyone playing the game has these issues whereas it seems to be something from a tiny player base that happens to have a competitive mind set in a game that doesn't even offer a competitive playlist.

One of my questions is *why doesn't it have a competitive playlist? Why is there no support for it? Why is it pushed being a casual game, when a lot of the bottom skill players can't even play it due to it being too hard?* The game suits a competitive environment due to the high skill cap and many areas of the game that can be practiced, and with better focus on keeping a balanced game it could probably thrive in that environment.

Also, tell me what parts of the video you disagree with, and why. That's something I'd like to hear a lot more about, more opinions, more viewpoints, more discussion. Maybe I'm completely wrong about a lot of this, and will change my mind. But so far your gripes seem to be with the method and the people rather than the content being discussed, lets bring it back to something a bit more useful?",,,,vinson ,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6smfr8,,,,,,,,,Keayesz,,1502416923.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1503952551.0,,,

I don't understand your 2nd paragraph at all.  

Granted, due to their popularity I'm guessing they were highly downloaded via Napster back in the day.  So, to a point, I understand their push back.

Times were changing where listeners were no longer going to spend $20+ per CD to only get one or two good songs.  We've seen how that's gone now = iTunes and Spotify type sites = they LOST but ultimately, they gained.  I may not like them overall ,but I may like a song or two and put them on my playlist via those types of services, so they're getting more than they would have.

EDIT:  There was another artist (actually he was dead, so it was his family) = Roy Orbison maybe who was also suing little kids and grandmothers during that time.  I chalk it up to growing pains.  At the end of the day, I still HAVE PAID FOR a Roy Orbison cd (his duet with KD Lang, doing ""Crying"" post humously).  I never listened to Metallica if I could avoid it, but I thought that Kirk guy was kind of cute.  lol

EDIT 2:  He was still alive (Roy Orbison, that is).  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOXMnYfJCtc when they did the remake.

Even back in the day, most bands STILL made most of their money off of touring and merch.  That's not something new.

They are tough and hit hard, so you do not develop the reflex of backing off into corridors, splitting groups at stairs, e[x]amining monsters you've never seen. Being a pussy: the mindset you need to really develop as a DCSS player. Getting into the habit of berserking when the going gets tough will get you killed in the mid- and end-game.

If your goal is to win the game they are one of the the best combo. If your goal is to get good at the game they are a bit of a trap. Plus you do not explore the casting side of things and the variety of gods you can play with.

I suggest playing a more varied range of characters. Random starts, human wanderers or whatever strikes your fancy. 
Humans might seem very weak when you look at their flat aptitudes but they gain XP levels very quick and can adapt easily to whatever you find.

I second watching ultraviolent4 and Demise's videos - unless you want a spoiler-free experience. UV4 plays slowly and explains in details his thought process, and he's got a good variety of race/background in his many playlist.

These are my favourite newbie-friendly combos:

* Gargoyle Gladiator with a quarterstaff of whatever-interesting-god-I-find-early
* Any Merfolks with a trident is a force to reckon with, and they have pretty good casting aptitudes, start as a gladiator, fighter or ice mage, poison mage
* Unarmed demonspawn monks often develop into very strong melee characters
* Hill Ork Monks with an axe (to explore gods: Beogh, Gozag, Makleb, Okawaru are good picks)
* Draconian Fire Elementalists or Conjurer (of Vehumet or Sif Muna or Fedhas)

I suggest keeping away from races that are too specialized as you learn the basics of the game: Formicid, Deep Elf (so fragile), Deep Dwarves (no regen), Felids, Octopus, etc. Explore them only once you have a good grasp of the interface and the basics.

I use Groove daily and its come a long way, but I'm still all in the Windows ecosystem including mobile, if I were using another mobile OS its less likely I'd use Groove. Mobile biting MSFT in the ass yet again. The UI is nice (they have Claudio Guglieri on the team which is probably why Groove is ahead of the pack in that area) and the library generally has what I'm looking for (excepting some notable record labels). I'm not really a user of discovery or playlist functionality, it invariably suggests trash whatever the platform, so I don't feel like I'm missing much.

She gave her mother the appraising look that only a 16 year old can muster and then flicked her eyes back to her history textbook.

""How was school?"" Paula said by way of greeting as she pulled off her sensible waitressing shoes in the entry. 

""Fine,"" sighed Bonnie. She weighed her options; talk to mom now or later?

""How was the math test? Did you crush those fractions?"" Paula smiled, the smile of a mother trying to make friends with a surly teen. 

""It was fine,"" scowled Bonnie. Couldn't her mom just let her be? She slapped the textbook shut and headed for the fire escape. 

""Is the soup on the stove?"" Paula called after Bonnie, and she caught the scent of tomato as Bonnie grunted a yes. *Teens,* she thought, and headed for the kitchen to make some garlic cheese toast. No one could resist garlic cheese toast. 

The owners of apartment 4A had also just arrived home. Joel poured his wife, Gail, a glass of wine and grabbed himself a beer from the fridge. ""Pizza?"" He waved their collection of take out menus under her nose.

""Psh,"" Gail pushed them away. She gave a spin as she kicked off her shoes. ""I can make a better pizza than they can deliver!"" She waltzed into the kitchen, selected a playlist on her phone, and started rummaging in the fridge. As Gail pulled back from the cold, arms filled with produce, she grinned at Joel. ""Go drink your cocktail on the terrace,"" she trilled in an over the top British accent, motioning to the fire escape. ""I'll have dinner ready in a jiffy, Guv'na!""

Joel smiled as he stepped back into the night air with his beer. How lucky was he? He glimpsed Gail out of the corner of his eye, flitting through the kitchen like the spirit of Bobby Flay, shuffling utensils and seasoning pots. Yes, he was the luckiest man alive. 

He took a swig of his beer and listened to the noise rising from the street far below and the giggles of the boys who lived above them in 5A. Apparently their father wasn't home yet, because they were dangling out the apartment window, phones in hand, just barely able to reach the Pokémon gym on the corner. 

There were fewer giggles in 5B as Albert supervised his daughter's piano practice. ""Again,"" he said sternly as she finished Sonata #3. ""It's still too choppy.""

She grimaced, but started again from the beginning. Albert's ears prickled as she accidentally hit an F-sharp, but her overall phrasing was slowly improving. That upcoming competition would never know what hit it. His daughter would be the best, as he had never been. 

Melissa and Nikki had shut the door of 6A tightly behind them that night, intent on enjoying a quiet evening on the couch. However, halfway through the recorded episode of So You Think You Can Dance, Mel decided she could think of a better use of their time. As she got up from the couch, she stared into Nikki's big, brown eyes and winked. ""You should follow me,"" Mel cooed, and she started towards the bedroom.

Nikki stretched her long legs and was at Mel's side in an instant. They stopped at the doorway and shared a deep kiss. ""I love you,"" Nikki breathed. Mel's smile grew wider, and she pulled Nikki into the bedroom. 

7A was bathed in icy silence, broken only by the tapping of keys. Kate sat at her desk, fuming as she put together the final touches on her report. How *dare* Scott judge her for working tonight! He knew she was presenting to Senior Leadership at the end of the week. She snuck a look at him in the reflection of her second screen. He was sulking on the fire escape platform, the spot he'd been since she put her laptop on the docking station. 

Scott stared at the building across the street, watching the nightly dance of curtains opening and closing, lights flickering at the moon. The clattering of the keys, paired with what sounded like the soft murmurs of lovers in the apartment below, was driving him crazy. He supposed he couldn't be angry; Kate was really nervous about this presentation. However, there was a box burning a hole in his pocket, and he was hoping that he'd still be able to coax her up to the roof for a glass of wine and a question under the stars...

But the roof was currently occupied by another couple. The two had managed to sneak in after one of the boys in 5A as he furiously tried to finish a battle before getting in the elevator. They found a vacant stairwell and a loose handle, allowing them access to this evening of solitude on the unknown roof. Only the moon saw the two, saw the man curl around the woman, and the sudden jerk. And the moon could only watch as the man deposited the lifeless body of the woman into the water tank, then whisk back down the empty stairwell and onto the street where he melted into the final commuters of the evening. 

""Dinner's ready!"" Paula called to Bonnie, and the teenager went back inside, ready to talk to her mom about her report card. 

The building shifted slightly, as if uncomfortable with the secrets kept within.

And then we get a small arc for both Hanamaru and Ruby where we have Hanamaru trying to get Ruby in the group, but afraid of participating with her, since she feels she can’t shine like the other girls, and would only be a problem for them, and Ruby concerned for her friend, who she believes to be the perfectly beautiful school idol, but is too filled with the thoughts of being just a side character to actually shine, even though, as we see through the eyes of Ruby, she finds their practice session to be fun.

I believe that part of the reason for Hanamaru’s side-character complex comes from all the time she spent reading books. She knows that every good protagonist is always accompanied by a reliable side-character, who pushes him forward, without taking the spotlight. She sees in Ruby her chance to be that side-character, even romanticizing this by saying she “opened the doors to her heart”.

But in the end, with help from Rin, Ruby is able to convince Hanamaru that even tough she may feel inadequate as a school idol, even though everyone says otherwise, it’s alright if she tries first to make sure, just like Rin did at the end of the episode where all the first years joined the group at once in LL S1. It’s very fitting that the one who tells her that it is okay to try it out, and that she feels it is alright to begin with that is Riko, who also had the problem of feeling inadequate.

**Seiyuu Corner**

First, let's have the seiyuu's opinion on the episode for today:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i391e-oSnE

Now, for today. Since we had a lovely Hanamaru in this episode, let’s have her lovely seiyuu here as well. Her name is Takatsuki Kanako, nickname King. Her call and response is to make a circle wih her hands, say “Ohana”, and complete with the crowd “-Maru!”.

[Takatsuki Kanako (Kunikida Hanamaru) – Call and Response](https://streamable.com/8vkjd)

* Her original nickname in university was Takatsuking, but when she joined Aqours, the members started calling her King. She has so many nicknames, she even made a [pool in Twitter](https://twitter.com/Kanako_tktk/status/879367927115390976) to know how most people call her.

* One thing you may easily notice about her is how she is very tall compared to the other seiyuus. In contrast to Hanamaru, who is the smallest Aqours’ girl, King is [as tall as Dia’s seiyuu](http://i.imgur.com/0OIcWTh.png), who are the tallest seiyuus. She is [HUGE](https://streamable.com/8ktgj).

* She loves Hanamaru a lot, so much so that she completely changed hairstyles to match the color and length of Hanamaru’s hair. Here’s how she looked [before](http://imgur.com/FZfOJUJ), and [now](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DAMQKF_U0AMXfl-.jpg).

* King loves playing videogames. So much so that she is one of the guests in Dengeki’s Playstation Lives, playing newly released games on stream every Thursday, 21:00 JST. You can watch one of her streams that was translated [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpGAOEz5_YQ). She is probably the one who brought the Switch Kanan’s and Mari’s seiyuus were [playing on in Numazu](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DGCddJ5UMAAzTBE.jpg).

* If you like to listen to anime song covers, you probably have alread heard her voice, since before she joined the Love Live! Project, she participated in several song covers, here’s a [playlist of all of them](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiyNhKK8jB9QhGnOg71vZ6S5HYWoGXPL-). She even covered LL S2 ED, [Donna Toki mo Zutto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZkU9zIBbFU&amp;index=5&amp;list=PLiyNhKK8jB9QhGnOg71vZ6S5HYWoGXPL-), she’s the one in cosplay at the top left. Her voice is so good she used to be singing idol in the cafés “Anisong Cafe&amp;BAR Arcadia” and “AKIHABARA MUSIC CAFE&amp;BAR 441” in Osaka.

* There’s also this [little performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RYHDjOYoGI) of the Yokai Watch song from when she was part of a band in high school.

* A huge weeb, she used to do cosplay. Here is a picture of her as [Nagato](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CljS8iJUgAAWZxV.jpg), and one as [Nico](http://i.imgur.com/1kuollq.jpg). Guess it must be cool for her to now be literally wearing cosplay to work.

* She used to like [The iDOLM@STER.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CljS_ETVYAAYJO0.jpg)

* Apparently, she likes to [sniff people’s shoes](https://streamable.com/1jixh) after training.

* King also is part of a 2-girl stream [with Sarara](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DESEhP3U0AAy9qw.jpg), a friend of hers. It’s a stream where they drink, play and talk about their lives [and stuff](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCxGGJ5UIAE4Ppr.jpg). [Pretty chill](http://imgur.com/a/CqYh6).

* Recently, Hanamaru won the voting to be Sega’s Image Girl in a Sega x Love Live! collaboration. King went to a Sega store [represent](https://twitter.com/Kanako_tktk/status/885106879570911232) [her](https://twitter.com/Kanako_tktk/status/885108416649117696) [girl](https://twitter.com/Newstv_jp/status/885098502144933889) in costume and all.

* [King is a Friend now!](https://youtu.be/EX_Fgi7vd5I?t=125) Well, a friend in a collaboration between a horse racing association and Kemono Friends (wouldn’t be the [strangest collaboration](http://img1.ak.crunchyroll.com/i/spire3/75a200b57d0363ce9e585c450d06d7131499706355_full.png) I’ve ever seen), but a horse friend nonetheless.",,,,MAL,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6so2tl,,,,,,,,,http://myanimelist.net/profile/NegiMahora,,1502308872.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1503912711.0,,,
t5_2qh1i,,,,False,,,,,,,AskReddit,,,,,,dldxnk4,,,0,,,,WeDemandTacos,,,t1_dlddxct,5,,,,,,"Honestly, I loved my c-section and I will be getting repeats for any future kids. I feel like people only get horror stories about c-sections and while they exist, they also exist for other types of birth too. C-sections are more dangerous for the mother and have a higher mortality rate for mom. The trade off is they are safer for the baby. For me, I had made a decision when I went in to be induced (and I'm not sorry slightly for being induced, past a certain points not inducing jacks up your child's chance of dying in utero and I started getting antsy at 41 weeks) that I was going to accept whatever birth it was that I was going to have and go with the flow. 

I went 42 weeks and 5 days with my son, they were delaying inducing me because a nearby hospital had closed so our delivery ward was flooded with people. They finally brought me in and said my baby would be around 7 pounds based on the final sonogram they gave to try to measure, which is around what my husband and I were when we were born respectively so we didn't question it. I was already having contractions but they gave me pitocin and while I felt a lot of pressure I was able to manage it. I didn't want to get an epidural too early in the process and feel the full burn when time came to push. I also got an IV because I was GBS positive, this killed my plans to labor in the tub like I had wanted but we shifted and my husband helped me labor in the shower off and on. My nurse team seemed relieved that I didn't throw a fit but I realized when I didn't go into labor ""naturally"" that I didn't call the shots of this show and was ok with it. 

On the second day my water broke and things went from intense to.. really intense. I was still holding out on the drugs because I wasn't dilated enough to be approaching active pushing. I rocked on a ball, I stood in the shower, my husband held me and rocked with me with me, etc. I could feel my son's head pushing into my pelvis bones and after long hours of feeling his head just bashing and bashing and nothing moving, I broke down and begged for the drugs. They got the anesthesiologist and he missed with the epi and instead hit a nerve in my back that caused my contractions to begin speeding up a crazy amount- instead of a couple of minutes I had fifteen to twenty seconds between a minute or two of sheer agonizing pain. I endured that for two hours while they got a new anesthesiologist and made sure giving me another epi would be ok, and towards the end I have no memory but my husband tells me I was screaming for my mother and that I was just a trembling slumped over mess sobbing uncontrollably when they finally gave me the second epi that actually worked. My son's vitals were good so they let me rest about 45 minutes and then woke me up and my OBGYN was like ""It's wrong you've been made to go this long when you're not progressing and you needed to be induced so late into the pregnancy any way."" She recommended a c-section and I won't lie, I about kissed her. The OBGYN on call before that had seen me in extreme pain and instead of asking what I wanted to do or keep open as options just said ""Well you still have time to labor"" and walked out. This dude was already on my shit list for hurting me and making me bleed while doing a NST at 41 weeks and delaying my induction. 

I signed the papers and my son was in the world 2 hours later. The C-section itself was calm and they did what they could to make me comfortable. They lowered the curtain enough so my husband and I could see our son coming up, we got skin to skin, and they even played the songs we'd made into a playlist for birth in the surgical suite. My boy was born to a song that meant a lot to us, and it was a happy, joyful moment for everyone from his delivering doctor to dad to me. He was over 10 pounds and I only put on 15 during my pregnancy. His head was so smashed up from pushing on my pelvis for those long hours, he had bruises and it took a few weeks for his forehead to smooth out and head to look normal. He wasn't going to fit and without a c-section, we'd have died. 

My milk came in less than 9 hours later after the c-section and I was walking around within 12 hours. I had no issue breastfeeding (not that you have to if you don't want to or can't, formula is such an amazing thing) and I was driving and relatively back to normal in two and a half weeks as far as mobility and healing goes. 

I think c-sections get this really bad rap when in cases like mine they were the most peaceful and mindful parts of the birthing process I got to experience. ",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6sdf35,,,,,,,,,,,1502298620.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1503907850.0,,,

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-3EjjDo4VT8

I've luckily had the pleasure of testing the maps with pistol starts with many of the authors back when they were made. There was a huge forger's push for pistol starts about a year ago but sadly 343 didn't budge or more likely just ignored it.

The main problem with BTB right now is actually that the BR has too much range, which sadly breaks alot of these map designs that were segmented by distances. That's why it's so difficult to get around on alot of these maps where you could move much easier before. Sadly, I don't believe a recon dmr would fix this as it would just make you more accurate at longer range. 

I wouldn't be opposed to a recon DMR in a social Arena playlist however. The pistol can be very unforgiving in arena and that could allow for more casual play with little to no reprecussions to gameplay as the weapons have identical TTK.

[Spoiler context](#s ""Alexandria Interlude, very last section"").
It is so fun to theorize exactly what the Simurgh intended with each memory she showed everyone, and that is because there are too many intentions and layers. One could say, for example, that the vision Krouse got were not only to keep him going, but to specifically disregard the better interests of his group and focus these pushes to go forward solely on Noelle, further detaching them and generating all the bigger issues they end up facing.
What Scott sees as many powers can be seen as just one, when talking about the Simurgh. He cited:

- Move things with its mind
- Sees the future
- Create cause and effect chains
- Borrow other powers

But what it actually does is just make an extremely good use of a mixture of telekinesis, telepathy and precognition. If the Simurgh picks the memories each person sees, it is safe to say that this is not an automated process, that this is happening at all times to all people present in her city-wide radius. What I got from my first read was that she logs through people's entire life, checks what matters most for her plan and makes them re-live it. That is what the singing was, for me, she cataloging through your head, humming to your thoughts like she is picking a playlist. We know that Haywire is a tinker who created interdimensional stuff, however we also know that the portal is too small for anything physical to go through, only data and media. So for me, either the Simurgh just attacked somewhere near where Haywire was and has his brain and ideas and plans on catalog, or the plans for his tech were close by. In the latter case, what I see as viable for the Simurgh is that she simply picked the parts Haywire used, created large-scale ones and checked for futures in which she got it right out of chance and just nailed it because that is basically what she does when she sees the future to avoid incoming attacks and such. She just gets it right.

-----

You've almost certainly played what I would call 'standard' or 'traditional' games, in that they follow this gameplay loop:
1.GM narrates something  
2.Players say what their characters attempt  
3(a).GM may appeal to rules (roll a check, etc)  
3(b).GM narrates the result  
4.Note that you have looped back to 1.

Like clearly you should play one of **D&amp;D**, or **Warhammer** (Fantasy or 40k), **World of Darkness** (preGMC) or something. There are 'normal' games, the expected kind of experience people think of with roleplaying. 

-----

Some games take a few small (but still very real) steps away from that standard or traditional scheme. 

* **Chronicles of Darkness** (post-GMC) has a 'conditions' system, which injects some player agency over the rules, (and some other subsystems)

* **Apocalypse World** (and other 'Powered by the Apocalypse' games) has a 'moves' system, which more explicitly restricts what the GM narrates, and often gives the player power to make choices mid-resolution, or demand a certain type of drawback from the GM

* **Freeform Universal** avoids numbered stats, instead caring about narrative relevant descriptors of things, and the dice roll results are micro-prompts for the GM on how to narrate the result.

* **FATE** rewards playing to narrative ideas (like having character flaws) and less rewards having a powerful character (e.g., ""Uncontrollable anger"" is probably a better trait than ""Expert Martial Artist"") by using a 'FATE point economy' to explicitly reward such things.   
[I personally haven't had a chance to play FATE, but here is a good [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOFXtAHg7vU) of it.]

-----

And some games are steeped in 'indie narrativism'. The mechanics are often new and revolutionary (being revolutionary doesn't make them necessarily good, although I think these games in particular are indeed good). The examples here are all GMless, but that may be more a feature of the kinds of games I've played, rather than a defining feature of this category.

* **Microscope** - Players (not as characters, but as players) take turns adding in elements of history into a timeline. The addition needn't be linear (and typically won't be). They will play out scenes in this world to learn more about its history, typically playing as different characters each time since each scene could focus on a different time and a different set of people.  

* **Fiasco** - Designed to make a funny story of overblown ambition. Here is a decent [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXJxQ0NbFtk&amp;list=PL8917DC2870FF2294) showing how the game works.

* **[Polaris (2005)](http://www.tao-games.com/polaris/)** - the core mechanic is a narrative negotiation. Really hard to explain without examples, so here is [a page with an actual play podcast](http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/theory/examples/podcasts.html). Mechanics push towards tragedy and draws backs at all times, and force the story to a 'bad' ending.

* **Hillfolk**. I haven't played it, so I offer this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wES5ufXETdE) on it instead.

-----

And if you want to just have an endless supply of reading material, there are lots of RPG writing competitions.

* [200 Word RPG competition](https://200wordrpg.github.io/) Lots of micro RPGs. Pretty hit and miss imo, but I could suggest some of my favourites if you like.

Intern at a music company that has access to greater than average Spotify data. The first day Killamanjaro was added to Spotify, it was added to 9 different Digster playlists. Digster is the title of Universal Music Group's Spotify playlists. This is what propelled Killimanjaro's plays and Killy's listeners. And simply put, this would NEVER happen unless there was some sort of deal already in place. 

Bonus: All 3 majors have their own playlists under other names. 
Filtr=Sony,
Digster=Universal,
Topsify=Warner,
Their playlists contain 90% of their respective catalogs. It's an easy way to keep their old music relevant, and to help push new songs. If you haven't noticed before, the cover art for these and Spotify playlists have a watermark of the company.

I have many subscriptions and end up with a long playlist.

I have a [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) attached to my TV and it's always online.

When I leave work, a script is automatically triggered, which downloads the complete playlist to my NAS as high quality MP4 video files.

As soon as I come home the downloads are done. I can push play and the playlist is running on my TV without any ads, video overlays or other annoying stuff.

to do this I use the [youtube-dl commandline tool](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl).

I also use some nerdy remote control and custom scripts, to launch various streaming services, twitch channels, youtube live streams or video files from my NAS very quickly and easy. I pretty much do everything over the commandline, which allows me to write aliases and functions to instantly launch videos and streams without ever interacting with the website or any graphical user interfaces.

In comparison to the most recent GTA playlists, for instance, it's really about the same. Where the WTF Challenge differs, obviously, is in the approval (likes) ratings. It is doing very badly there.

My guess would be that a lot of people watched the WTF Challenge purely to see what it was about, but now that they've seen it, they won't be tempted to see another video of this kind on the boiks' channel. I think it was an experiment, which probably won't be repeated. Maybe they just wanted to see how far they could push it, and I think they've found the limit of their audience now.

The WTF Challenge might just be the logical conclusion of the House Party videos, too. All three House Party videos did well, although the last one obviously had a more mitigated reception. After that, I imagine they just wanted to figure out just how far they could go while keeping viewership as well as approval high.

As for other types of content, I'd say vlogs in general are Hat Films' best content by far. It definitely shows that they have a passion for this type of content. The most recent Tesla vlog, for instance, was excellent in my opinion. I look forward to the USA roadtrip. 

The GTA playlists are the cookie cutter, banter-friendly content. It's a similar role to what Trial's used to be. I enjoy watching them, mostly because of the banter.

What I mean is, switch from a Friday or Saturday night to a Sunday, but use the same venue so you don't lose your deposit, and make it a Breakfast menu instead of a dinner. No cocktail hour.  Only offer Bloody Marys and Mimosas and wine for alcohol which will drop your bar bill by probably 2/3rds.  Switch live music to DJ or your own playlist. It goes without saying but you dont' need limousines or horse drawn carriages or a trolley to ferry people back and forth between sites - they can bring their own cars. As for flowers and table decorations - this is something I've done personally: [Ikea 99-cent bud vases](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00338577/) + [Costco Gerbera Daisies](https://www.costco.com/150-Stem-Assorted-Gerbera-Daisies-.product.11605220.html) bought in bulk.

If that won't work, then, sorry, but honesty is the best policy. Unless you want to get lawyers involved (and trust me, NO, you don't) send your MIL an e-mail in writing, with a complete and thorough list of every single expense, and notes of the dates and times when she agreed to the expenses. Then also present her with the cost to you for cancelling everything at this stage - that you WILL be out the money, that nonrefundable deposits are just that - NONREFUNDABLE. . And that, unless the payments that are due now are paid in full by her, and the balances paid off IN FULL (state that explicitly, you only contracted these things on her verbal agreement that she would pay. That you both must cancel the wedding as you cannot afford it on your own.) And then tell her if you don't hear back from her within 48 hours, you will cancel everything. That you will still GET MARRIED (Specifically state this - if this was her way of pushing you guys to break up, make sure she knows it won't actually work) but that she is no longer a part of your lives in the future.)

Then, how you cancel the wedding is up to you. FYI, is it impolite to let it all be known and publicly shame her? Yes, it is. There is no etiquette rule that says when a family member turns out to be less generous and honest that you hoped, all good manners take a backseat: ""YES! Air your family dirty laundry and your financial business to all the guests! No, you won't be a social pariah yourselves for doing that publicly!"" Your feelings may be hurt, and your hard work may come to nothing, and your fiance may cry helpless tears of disappointment and rage, and you've learned a very expensive and embarrassing life lesson about trusting this person EVER again, but that's part of being a grownup. Learning who you can and can't trust. Unless your fiance's mother runs around offering to subsidize weddings for everyone else on your guest list, this is nobody's business (and they don't' want to be dragged into it). So make no formal announcement. Trying to air how she screwed YOU over screws yourself over - it's a bad Public Relations move socially. After all, it shows you didn't have the money to pay for it yourselves *after 12 years* of engagement? Not many people are going to sympathize, it would be all too easy for her to spin the story that you wanted WAY too much and were very extravagant, and it would be her word against yours. 

But, what you can do, is tell the true story to a few select people on each side prior to the announcement of cancelling the wedding. Trust me, word WILL spread. Gossip like this will move like lightning.",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6s3chi,,,,,,,,,,,1502113949.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1503841229.0,,,

t5_2qh22,,,,False,,,,,,,anime,,,,,,dl87ux3,,,0,,,,Ikki67,,,t1_dl87ude,5,,,,,,"###My thoughts of the entire show up to this point

After my first watch, this show was among my top 10 favorites. This rewatch pushed it forward to my top 5. I don't know exactly wich position it has in that top 5, as I have to rewatch the other 4 to make up my mind on that. But at the moment it's could easily be my favorite show, or the second behind K-On!!.

While this show doesn't have the thrilling and romance elements of Steins;Gate, the political drama of Code Geass, the philosophical mess of Evangelion or Madoka, the over the top hilarity and hype of TTGL and Jojo, or the world building of Hunter X Hunter. What makes me like this show more than them, even if I have rated all of these higher is the emotions that the show generates in me. 

Usually when I end a good show, I end up slightly depresed because it ended, but with this show I didn't. I couldn't. Why? well, because even if the show ended, µ's is still a part of my life. I have their music, and not just OST of the show, real music, and music that wasn't even featured in the show. The group has been disbanded, but their legacy is still there. Sure, I will never get to see them perform live, I probably won't ever get a new album release, but I can still enjoy them, and will likely keep doing it for years. It has trascended the anime itself into my daily life and is not just another name on my MAL page.


###How my descent into Idol Hell started.


As many others here, I knew about Love Live existance because of memes. [Nico-Nico-nii](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANWU_Hk0yWE) was my first exposition to the show, followed by [Honoka raping Maki.](https://streamable.com/gi6m8) But what pushed me into watching it was the reactions over a[ meme I posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/6fp7g8/best_girl_4_a_certain_salty_railgun_elimination/dijx36z/) when the Best Girl Contest started this year. I didn't knew any of those girls there, I just found the image fitting for shitposting.

And so I started watching it, and it was fun, then episode 3 came. And I realized it wasn't all fun and games, wich made me more interested into keep watching it. About 50 hours later I had watched all of S1, the Ova, S2, the movie, and was making a playlist of every song I could find in Youtube. I found a new favorite show, and new favorite songs too.

Just two months ago, I had no idea of who these girls were, and now I'm in love with all of them. I cried for them more than I cried even in family funerals, I don't cry a lot. But this show really knows how to make you do that.

---

###My expectations for Sunshine


Going into Sunshine with high hopes of more awesome music and fantastic girls. It will be my first time, so I'll hope all of you rewatchers keep up with the awesome reviews and music primers. This rewatch has been a blast so far. I haven't participated in many of them, but this one is the best I've been part of so far.

I've said before that I didn't watch Sunshine after finishing the movie because I was afraid of being biased against the new group just because they weren't µ's. I didn't want to be unfair and compare them all the time.

Now, since pretty much every rewatcher here appears to love Aquors, some even more than the µ's. And their music appearently is at equal footing or even better. I'm really hyped!

I honestly don't know what Respawn was thinking, T1 held out a decent player base on the Xbox One for a long while and now T2 is practically on life support before they've even finished with post-launch content. EA fucked up with marketing (nobody seemed to know the game was even out on the PS4) and the launch date, but Respawn was so set on ""fixing"" mechanics that they didn't even check to see if they were in need of fixing in the first place.

Bounty Hunt sucked, the traditional grunt-filled attrition mode was the lifeblood of Titanfall - objective modes aren't typically what most people in the fast-paced ""military"" shooter genre focus on (yes, that's still the market segment Titanfall fits in - and yes, while people still play dom and such in CoD TDM is always the most popular playlist). Then there was the titan shield changes which made it feel pointless to even care too much about piloting your titan instead of leaving it in auto, since you'll constantly be hunting for batteries to keep it alive (the game may be centered around ""team"" modes, but when's the last time you've seen coordinated teamwork in pub games in this subgenre - you can't rely on other players to help you get batteries even with the titan drop incentive they get).

I really hope Respawn makes another attempt, they had a great multiplayer experience with T1 and a great single player experience in T2, if they can refine the strengths of both games along with a proper marketing push from EA and a non-suicidal release window they could knock it out of the park.",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6rm6g7,,,,,,,,,,,1501901956.0,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,1503781565.0,,,

- Working in a team

I can support a team just fine, but if my success is dependent on theirs, I am not interested, as I will push them harder and expect more of them than they are willing to put out. Always.

- Static rules with no reason behind them

""That's just how we've always done it"" is not a good enough answer for me. Anything can always be improved, **always.** If you tell me something is certain, I will question it, and I will try my hardest to prove you wrong.

*Example:* I was told that if you feed boxes into this box assembler upside-down (They meant backwards) it would jam the machine. Except, even when I put the boxes in the same way all the time, it jammed anyway, so I figured there was no harm in testing their statement. I just happened to be the only one on the line that night, and loaded the boxes so that they changed face every ten boxes. NOT A SINGLE JAM ALL NIGHT. I brought this up to the managers, and was let go, because it wasn't how they did things. (Wow, the ad on the right of my screen is for that employer. Ha ha.)

- I work too hard

Sometimes I can be so wrapped up in my work that I skip breaks, which can land my bosses in trouble, even though it's not their fault.

I enforce rules that even the managers don't enforce, but then why do we have these rules? I can't wear a headband to keep sweat out of my eyes, but that guy can wear a hoodie that is clearly against policy? We can't have our own music players in the warehouse, but radios are fine? Radios take up more of my workspace, and play music I can't completely control. Where my music is on my iPod, barely taking any space, and the playlist I have for work is 100% SFW. Some of it doesn't even have words, so it's just background music.

- I lie

If there isn't a crystal clear rule on it, I'll make a judgement call that I think is best, and sell it as if it's official ruling. Anything that can help the company save time/money, I will do. Um, you know, I'm not sure, lemme check with my manager quick. Yeah, sorry, he said no.

[](/sp)

At one point I had had ten jobs within 5 years, so if you can ditch my habits, DO IT. They will just make you trouble. I've only just recently celebrated my first whole year at a job, one where I feel like I really fit.

It also lost its shit when we got an announce date for a standalone playlist. Also Frontier Defense is 85% Titan combat. I don't really see anyone going ""frontier defense is the worst"".

Reddit doesn't represent the majority of the players at all. It's a very little, very minor niche, with very specific player stereotypes. Judging any reddit reaction to anything, in videogames, doesn't tell anything at all.

&gt;Because when a game does well, all other developers should go ahead and stop working on their game if its the game genre, right? We don't need any other Narrative driven FPS games, we already have Halo CE after all.

Absolutely. Even if you don't have any experience in how the videogame market works, or how releases are staggered if possible, it should sound logical. Of course you want to avoid releasing in the same timeframe as another game in the same genre, especially if that other game is highly popular. On foot gunplay of Titanfall 2 and COD are very close, the biggest difference being the type of motion (which, in TF2, is quite hardcore and appeals to a niche of players) and the mech mechanic (which appeals mostly to mechs fans, and the gameplay in mechs isn't crazy or really ""specific"" to mechs, it's just slower FPS gameplay).

This means that TF2 and COD are in direct competition, even more than with BF1. Most people that play FPS games won't buy 3 games of the same type in the same month. If these 3 FPS release at the same time, they'll pick one and ignore the other two. So yes, they should have either pushed their release back or moved it forward. It was absolutely 100% sure they would be heavily harmed by COD and BF1.",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6rjwyu,,,,,,,,,,,1501874037.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1503770995.0,,,

&gt; For the past four years, the Denver-based indie rockers of Instant Empire have played regularly in Colorado and toured the Midwest with aspirations as big as their sound. While most IE songs are anthemic and rowdy enough to keep fans fist-pumping, the literate lyrics and the band's complexity beg a second (or third) listen at home on the couch. Their brand of aggressive indie rock has drawn comparisons to The Hold Steady, The National, Manchester Orchestra and Bright Eyes.

&gt; Thematically, IE’s songs relate to the zeitgeist: our struggle to overcome isolation, connect to others, and find meaning in chaotic lives. The band’s sound is broad and unafraid to experiment. Songs are highlighted by a tight rhythm section, melodically rich guitar interplay, dark synth underpinnings, and vocals that are at once urgent and passionate.

&gt; After releasing three quality EPs—Instant Empire (2011), Heavy Hollow (2012), and Keep Up! (2013)—IE was selected to record with Christopher Tyng’s Grow Music Project in Santa Barbara, CA. The single from this session will appear on the band's first full-length album, planned for Spring 2015. Jonathan Low (The National, The War on Drugs, Modern Baseball, etc) and John Vanderslice (Spoon, Death Cab for Cutie, Mountain Goats, etc.) have signed on to record and produce the new record. In 2014, the band was also invited to sign with the Red Bull Sound Select artist development program.

&gt; This is a band that has found its sound and that believes it is on the cusp of creating something special. Instant Empire is lead singer Scotty Saunders with guitarists Sean Connaughty and Lou Kucera, Aaron Stone on bass, Doug Chase pushing buttons and Tristan Kelley on drums. Read more on Last.fm.

They are saying that they are moving ""the line"" of what is wrong and what is right a bit closer to the place where people are expecting it to be. Policy on YouTube is surprisingly democratic, a while back you used to get strikes if you put tags in the description, whereas now, due to so many people employing this strategy without knowing better, they at most make the video private until you clean up the description.

Wow that horoscope's synchronicity is amazing.  :)  Do you experience synchronicities often?  Were the chills you felt similar at all to when you were spiritually awakened?  That's the feeling I was trying to explain to you before.  I even said Bible verses was a way that I can produce that feeling.  :)  For me, I think it is a feeling of a positive spiritual presence outside of my own.

You are welcome for the advice.  :)  I am honored that you think I know exactly what to say.  :)  I think you are drawing messages and synchronicities to yourself with your positivity.  :)

I am glad you followed up on my comment about thinking in extremes.  You are absolutely right that thinking like a conniving person will make the negativity rub off on you.  I always correct myself if my mind if a bad thought enters in but I think it still gets into your subconscious, which is why I think the thought pops up in the first place.  I was just explaining how I got to where I am.  :)  I am not sure if it is advisable or not.  I think you should decide for yourself!  :)  I think you probably shouldn't think that way based on what you said.  Because of that, I think material I linked you may not be for you.  I definitely think that people can find their way without knowing evil well.  :)  It may well be the better path.  I was just already aware of evil when I started along my path.  I think everyone's is different.  :)

&gt; What do you do with the knowledge once you know how they may think?

Really, I just see if one of the possibilities I have learned about fits a situation.   I am not sure if I should give this as an example as it is evil.  I learned about the Hegelian dialectic and how I feel it is used in politics to further the New World Order agenda.  A politician of one party pushes for one thing and a politician from the other party pushes against it.  By being in control of both sides, the true agenda can be whatever lies as a compromise in the middle.  False flag attacks are another good example of this.

I hope this helps!  :)

&gt; The Ataris are a punk rock band from Anderson, Indiana formed in 1995. The band originally consisted of singer/songwriter/guitarist Kris Roe and guitarist Jasin Thomason. Using a 4-Track, they wrote and recorded demos in Kris's bedroom, with a drum machine as the drummer. At this point in time the band was searching for a full-time drummer. The first step in their road to success came when Kris attended a The Vandals concert at Bogart's in Cincinnati, where he passed one of the demo tapes to The Vandals' roadie Fitz. A few weeks later, Kris received a call from Kung Fu Records, who told him they were interested in putting out their record. Though they were initially just searching for a drummer, the band signed to Kung Fu Records anyway. The label sent the tape to various drummers, and eventually the band settled on Derrick Plourde. The band then proceeded to record their debut album ""Anywhere But Here"", tracking the whole thing in less than a week. In June of 1997, Kris moved from Anderson to Santa Barbara, California. Shortly afterward, Marko 72 joined the band on bass. Jasin Thomason left the band to go back to Indiana, and the group toured as a three-piece from then on. After a short tour in October 1997, the original lineup disbanded. Kris reformed the group with Mike Davenport on bass, Chris Knapp on drums, and Patrick Riley on guitar. From there, they gradually increased in popularity in the underground punk scene, producing the well-acclaimed EP, ""Look Forward to Failure"", where they collaborated with blink-182's Mark Hoppus on one of the tracks. However, it wasn't until the release of ""Blue Skies, Broken Hearts...Next 12 Exits"" in the year 1999 that they started to be much more reputable. This album, along with ""Look Forward to Failure"", is responsible for the well-known punk rock anthem, ""San Dimas High School Football Rules"". Today, many of their original fans consider this the best and most hardcore album in The Ataris' catalogue. After this album, Riley left the band, and was replaced with Marco Peña.

&gt; Kris Roe also took on the role of managing other punk bands such as Useless ID from Haifa, Israel. They collaborated on a split EP entitled ""Let It Burn"". Kris also acted as co-producer with Mass Giorgini (whose other production credits include working alongside Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day) for a ]label]Cincinnati, OH-based band called the National Trust in 2004, an album which is as-of-yet unreleased..

&gt; After a long delay, the album End Is Forever was released in 2001. This album was a testament to Kris Roe's increasing maturity as a songwriter. Most of the songs, especially ""Fast Times at Dropout High"", touched on very personal and emotional topics such as losing a sibling because his parents gave his newborn brother away for adoption. Once again the lineup changed, with John Collura replacing Peña on guitar.

&gt; On the 24th of June 2002 The Ataris left Kung Fu Records and signed with Columbia Records. Later in that year they recorded their 6th album, ""So Long, Astoria"", released on March 4th, 2003. This album was responsible for giving them their break into the mainstream audience and generated many successful singles, including ""In This Diary"" and their cover of Don Henley's ""The Boys of Summer"".

&gt; After touring behind the album for most of 2003, the band began writing the follow-up to ""So Long, Astoria"". Much of 2004 was spent in inactivity. In February of 2004, the band released ""Live At The Metro"", an album containing a full concert at The Metro in Chicago, as well as acoustic tracks. Mike Davenport and Chris Knapp left the band in early 2005.

&gt; Recording of ""Welcome the Night"" began in February 2005. Along with it came five new members - Sean Hansen filling the bass position, Shane Chickeles on drums, and guitarist Paul Carabello, Angus Cooke (Who played Cello on ""End Is Forever""), and Bob Hoag on 3rd guitar, Cello, and Keyboards respectively. The group spent all of spring and summer recording at Seedy Underbelly in Los Angeles. ""Welcome the Night"" was orginally due out in April or May of 2006 but as of March 2006 the release date was pushed back to July of 2006. The release date of this album was once again been pushed back to possibly early 2007 after The Ataris asked to be released from their contract with Columbia Records, which the label agreed too. The ""Welcome the Night"" album was released in late February to an eager Ataris fan base. Unfortunately, it was not what they expected. The ""Welcome the Night"" album took a completely different approach to music. In a drastic deviation from his past traditions of whimsical, nostalgic pop songs, Roe used the new album to pursue a much more mature post-rock/progressive sound, an initiative which many speculate arose from the divorce of his wife and other personal conflicts. While ""Welcome the Night"" is certainly a great departure from The Ataris' roots, Roe has indicated that their upcoming release will attempt to return to the happy, youthful overtures that older fans have grown accustomed to.

I don't really see how people can get bored of this game. Given how much new content is coming out most things stay fresh. The 4 different classes play so different that you can switch it up whenever you like and it feels like a different game. The guns have a lot of variation too. Also the Vehicles, behemoths.

First off, when you wake up and know that mood is going to hang over your day, it's good to have a solid morning routine in place to perk you back up. For me, I have a playlist or two of music that makes me really happy. Music I can't be sad to, music I can sing along to and use to pull myself up. I listen to it almost from the beginning of when I wake up to when I get to work, or my destination. (Typically it's 90s house music or something similarly upbeat. It also energizes me for the day ahead. Typically stay away from love songs. )  I play this when I shower, brush my teeth, get dressed etc. 

Also, a tip for if you have to listen to love songs: sing them to yourself about yourself. We are conditioned to think we are bad at our core, and unworthy of love. So hearing a beautiful love song and imagining that you're not only the recipient but the singer sounds cheesy, but it helps a lot. 


If I really need to, I'll meditate in the morning. Breathing exercises help quite a bit, and I focus on the love I have for people and send that love actively from my heart to theirs. It's a good way to release some of that pent up energy in a positive way. 

Continually I try to put myself (safely) in situations and around people who do kind things for me in a parental way. If I feel comfortable enough I'll explain that it's difficult for me but I'm pushing myself to heal with these types of things.  For example, someone bought me a gift that a parent would buy to care for their child. I told them beforehand that I might get weird and uncomfortable but I wanted to get past it. They were very understanding and helped me through the process. 

Always remind yourself this: you are worthy of love and kindness from others, even when your mind tells you that you're not. Active self care is important to keep up your spirit and the practice of self respect. 

Hope this helps, and I'm definitely empathetic to your struggle. You've got this!",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6r463i,,,,,,,,,,,1501683014.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1503699872.0,,,

I'm confused as to why you're making an unnecessarily high-and-mighty moral argument because you're that offended by someone else's opinion on one topic in a long-running comedy show that you feel the need to express it here as if it's at all relevant. You've taken the time to tell everyone that you listened to *one* out of *sixty* episodes wherein you took offence to one approximately five-minute segment and felt the need to tell other comedy-lovers that this show is therefore not worth listening to. 

As a sidenote for any passersby reading this, this show is very much is worth it. If you like just about any other Radio 4 panel show you'll probably like this. There are always strong lineups and pressuring comedians to say things they don't believe pushes them past their sensibilities and creates some interesting comedy. David Mitchell is excellent at this so his episodes are great to seek out, not that I need to tell people on this sub to do that. The first few series with Baddiel are a bit different in tone to the later series with Coren-Mitchell so if you don't like the early episodes make sure to try again when she starts hosting. (*That* is what this comments section is for)

Back to my point, I don't understand why you would do this. Your commitment to rubbishing something and someone, presumably for the sole reason that it has to do with religion, is just a bit... desperate.

A real big problem that Spotify is basically at whims to the licensing of music by Big Music.  There's a lot of competition right now and when other companies like Apple bid up for exclusive rights, or Big Music and starts demanding more from Spotify then that library is going to shrink.

Just like Netflix, remember they used have a HUGE library of top shelf recently out of theater big blockbusters. Now they have direct-to-dvd garbage and sequels no one wants to see.. and their original content which is why they've been pushing original content hard.

Once Spotify starts hemorrhaging and losing licensing to really popular music, and people will quickly get mad that they don't have everthing they like on their playlist that they onced to have, (hell I get mad about it already with just a few songs), it can quickly spiral downhill. And unlike Netflix which produces original content, I honestly don't see Spotify getting into their own production biz but maybe they'll try to get exclusive licensing from big artists themselves which will add up costs too.

So Spotify could easily teeter on the precipe of losing major amounts of library fast which could lose users, and if they start losing users or need to pay more for licensing they'll have to ramp up monthly fees. Ask yourself how willing you'd pay for $20 or $25 a month? That could lead to user drop as well (also why Netflix has been very relunctant to increase fees and favored producing their content instead of paying to licensing big movies).

Pandora stock is probably a good expectation to have here. They, weirdly, had a couple of good years then tanked and have basically flatlined with very slight decline to no growth ever since.",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6r10ui,,,,,,,,,,,1501644303.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1503690017.0,,,

Really important and ""mindless"" way (at first) to learning any language is to listen a lot. At the beginning you don't need to understand anything, you are supposed to listen to the sounds - just to get used to it. Next - you should pay attention to rhythms, phonemes and patterns, while learning basic vocabulary and grammar from more structurized resources (language courses, books). 


I think that listening to the audio courses while driving your car poses too much distraction (if you kill yourself in a car accident you will not learn anything more). Still, if you want to push your time efficiency to the boundaries you can start to listen to German music. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0768hWMEUk - you can find a list of German bands in the description. 


Instead of listening solely to audiocourses I encourage you to listen to podcasts and audiobooks of your choice while commuting using public transportation, while doing your chores etc.


Worth paying attention to: 

- Spotify Deutschland shares a lot of public playlists with audiobooks in German. 

-- Spotify Deutschland profile - https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify_germany

-- For example: Sherlock Holmes https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DXb0c3XZxcHTL

- DW offers for free podcast with slowly spoken news reports (with transcripts)

&gt; ***CANALS***

&gt; You never forget your first run to the Longshot on Canals – and that tense 1v1 showdown that follows. Canals returns in Gears of War 4, bringing back the classic triple bridge combat over a shallow canal that was a defining part of the Gears of War 1 Versus experience. Set in the city of Timgad in the dark of the night lit only by moonlight and street lamps, Canals oozes with that classic Gears of War ominous atmosphere.

&gt; Snipers have a massive impact on the flow of the fight with long sightlines and plenty of places to hide, but prepared to pull out your Gnasher at a moments notice for an intense close quarters fight on the narrow bridges.

(Just splitting the map details up.)

&gt; ***FORGE BLITZ***

&gt; Forge Blitz is a tighter, faster pace evolution of the map Forge that builds on the spirit of the original to create a map filled with new combat experiences. All of this action takes place in a sand-swept factory damaged over time by a Windflare, underneath a blazing hot desert sun.

&gt; If the original Forge was chess-like, Forge Blitz is chess on a high speed moving train. We’ve looked at every key fight on the map and found new ways to make them faster, more tactical and more intense than ever before.

&gt; Gone are the secondary entrances to the Control Room as well as the elbow behind the Incinerator, forcing combat into more focused areas with more direct fronts. Both exits from either spawn have also been tightened up to provide less open space and more opportunities to be aggressive.

&gt; The Control Room combat is now also more intense than ever with more angles and cover options to push your opponents hard. The defining Incinerator still dominates the horizon, but now you’ll need to look out for the telltale flames inside to know if it’s armed and ready. One button press from an enemy or ally, and you could be toast! These new changes were influenced by Forge’s time as a Gears Esports Pro Circuit map, and we can’t wait to see teams take on this map at the highest level this August.

Both maps are available now for Season Pass Holders in the Double XP and 20% Bonus Credit ‘Developer Playlist’! Everyone can dive into both Forge Blitz and Canals beginning on August 8th when they are added to Public Matchmaking.

***Summer of gears***

Summer is upon us, and we’re celebrating in Gears of War 4 Versus with an increase to the First Win of the Day Credit Bonus!

Every day in August, your first win of the day is worth 500 Credits – an increase from the standard 100 Credits. That means an extra 12,400 Credits are up for grabs this August if you win one match every day!
Escalation map changes

Based on feedback gathered at our recent Pro Player playtest, we have made a number of changes to four maps for Escalation.

**Diner**

Rings Changed: A and C

We found the rings were a little too far away from the team spawns as well as too hard to push into when the enemy held your home ring. By moving A and C away from the L corners, the home rings are now a more vulnerable and accessible location for players.

**Impact**

Rings Changed: A, B, C, D and F

Our goal with the changes to the Impact Rings was to move the home rings closer to spawn so they require less time to traverse to off of spawn.

A and C were moved off the planter balconies to the top of the stairs just above. This new location provides quicker access for your own home and makes enemies exposed when attempting to capture your home ring. We also found the old positions of these rings allowed for quicker 3 caps than desired, due to their positioning allowing for very fast rotations. - the previous position allowed for very fast rotations.  D and F were moved slightly closer to the team spawns to provide quicker access as well as the ability to capture your own home ring in cover. 

The middle B ring was also moved to account for the home hill changes to improve rotations and interactions in the fight for mid-hill. This new position also unlocks more support play by making the windows more effective at impacting ring fights.

**The Slab**

Rings Changed: A, B, C, D, E, F

A, C, D and F were moved to more interesting cover layouts to improve fights for home hills on both offense and defense. These new positions also prevent fights against spawn protection which were present in the old setup.

B and E were moved to more vulnerable areas in order to provide more contested mid-ring fights.

**Lift**

Weapon Placement Changed: E Ring

The weapon at E ring has been moved from at the top of the stairs to in between the railings, allowing more options to affect the pickup. This also prevents players from rushing for a quick pick-up and then immediately rolling back down the stairs. The goal is a more dynamic fight that requires commitment from both sides.

Mark your calendars for new events coming this month in Gears of War 4!

First up, it wouldn’t be a new month without a new Craftable Character – and this month is no different. Introducing Classic Commando Dom!

Our monthly Versus and Horde events continue this month with a new Horde event on August 18th and Classic One Shot One Kill on Canals on August 25th. If you’re a Horde fan, our latest Horde variant ‘Anything Goes’ challenges is still active – and now, as of this update, you can play it whenever you want on any map in Private Match!

That’s it from us today – see you in the Developer Playlist!

* Updated Escalation rings for Diner, Impact, and The Slab
* Changed a Weapon Pickup Location on Lift
* Improved JD, Kait and Del's Multiplayer dialogue to match the recent dialogue changes for other characters
* Fixed an issue that could cause Customization Options to reset
* Fixed missing collision volumes for Grenades on certain areas of Raven Down
* Horde: Reduced effectiveness of spawn manipulation on Blood Drive and War Machine
* Reclaimed Windflare: Fixed an issue where the Kestrel could sometimes not die if killed out of the playable area
* Windows 10: Fixed a rare issue that could cause Season Pass to not function correctly

**(Note: Scrapping duplicates of Customization items will reset the selection for that specific item. We are working to fix this in a future Update)**

Whoo lordy have I missed working on the game! After a long 3+ week vacation, it feels so good to return to work. Just in this one day back on the job, I've been able to do quite a bit that I'm so excited to share with you!Recent developments and changes After receiving some good feedback about the game from the testers, it has been decided that the Immunity ability will be replaced by an ability called Transform. This ability's cost and time span has not been determined yet, but here's out it goes. The ability is simple; in a tight spot and a narrow window? Use Transform to shrink yourself to a third of your size and squeeze through those tiny cracks. (I should really make a 70's TV ad video like that. Hey, good trailer idea) To see how it works, you can see a quick video showing briefly how it works and what it looks like. Find the video on our Twitter. Level creation has been halted as I sort out GUI and the works. This will continue once I sort out more of what I need from Steam and figure out more compatibility for a level editor.  The music system has been smoothed out more and that annoying button has been moved to a separate menu. That menu will soon be the settings menu. The music system will also be smoothed out to allow a playlist of in-game tracks. I do not think adding your own music to play in the game will be an option right now. A really cool game mode idea has come up where the clock isn't for individual levels, but for a whole run. For you speedrunners, you can race to see how quickly and efficiently you can complete the whole game. As to when this will be implemented, I'm not sure right now, but the idea is so good that I can't possibly pass it up. If I have to implement it after the game's initial release, then so be it. The UI is slowly being converted into a GUI. Here's a chunk of the UI we have so far. Only the top bar is done for now as I'm still working on assets for the bottom with the abilities and whatnot. The Dust counter has also been moved to the bottom of the screen. You'll see once I finish the GUI within the next few days so keep posted on Twitter about that. The art assets aren't quite final yet, but will slowly be smoothed out and perfected.  Speaking of level editors, I'm not sure when it will be completed. It has been pushed to the bottom of my list for now to create, but the game is being setup to be compatible, one piece at a time. As promised before, if it needs to be made post-release, then so be it and I will roll out free updates of fresh levels or community levels. Finally, it is possible that some key things in the game, such as abilities and Dust (specifically Dust) will be seeing some renaming to fit more in the scope of the game. Somethings may be renamed, somethings may not, or the whole name of the game could change. (not that major) Just looking into some tweaks.Overall, quite a lot has happened and I'm really proud with the direction of the game. Just need to smooth some more wrinkles and implement some more key stuff, but I think nailing this out to be done will be a fantastic achievement. I really do have to take a minute and thank all of you supporting the game, helping out, giving feedback, and rooting for me. It really feels awesome to know that I can deliver a product for you all that you're all excited about. Even something as simple as adding the game to your wishlists or keeping up with forum posts or just liking forum posts make me really happy. I've been monitoring the interest of the game and I am so happy with what I'm seeing that I truly can't wait for release. You all have been great and look forward to getting this game into your hands.Keep posted on my Twitter or the Templarius Games Studios Twitter for updated information in realtime.

It is a mistake to believe that removing the skirmish playlist will spread that population across Team Arena and HCS. Myself and many of my friends have no interest in pushing ranked, and will find ourselves without a preferred social playlist. This decision will alienate social players who have no interest in ranked. 343 since the beginning of the release has focused on competitive halo, and this decision echoes the same. No consideration appears to have been given to the traditional halo player who wants 4v4 BR starts, to which Team Skirmish was the closest. OP would seem to agree: ""They seem to be under the impression that I'll now go play ranked instead, but really I'll probably just stop playing Arena all together outside of BTB."" - u/JoeRLL

Social has already been fucked up because you can't talk to anybody, where's the social? Remember Social FFA where you couldn't talk to other players? Now removing Skirmish will leave BTB as the only ""Halo"" playlist. 

This decision will alienate the audience that has kept the Halo Franchise perpetuating, and cater to the competitive audience that 343 seems so interested in. Whatever ""threshold"" 343 has decided Skirmish doesn't meet is arbitrary, and every effort should be given to revive the playlist - but they have no interest in it. They see low numbers on the playlist and assume that people just aren't interested. In truth, people dislike how 343 is treating social and are leaving the game. Now they want to shut the door completely on the social side because numbers are low? I'd rather see them invest in their game than cut out parts they deem low population, when in fact those parts are quintessential halo.

Mark my words, this decision will cause Halo 5 to drop from [17th on the most played list](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/most-played/games/xbox?target=games..all) to below 20.

Alternatively, put a 4v4 BR start Slayer social playlist in effect - I'd wager Halo 5 rises to above 15 within a month of implementing. Halo 5 cannot run on competitive population alone, but 343 acts like that is all that exists.

**Smart/meaningful touches:** This is something that I definitely need to work on. I've noticed that I will often hit the ball right at an opponent, handing over possession and allowing them to take a shot on goal. 

**Force yourself to be faster:** I play against high-level players at a high play speed pretty regularly when I play unranked. I played against Kronovi and his gf a couple weeks ago and managed to make it to OT, although my teammate did do most of the work lol. I feel like I'm able to keep up speed-wise, and that it's more of a car control/gameplay mechanics thing for me. 

**Push through and don't worry about rank:** This is something that I've been trying to do recently. As I said before, I play well in unranked (my MMR is 1000+, top 0.3% according to RL tracker network) so I know I should be able to do well in ranked too. 

**Mentally note when you mess up:** I definitely do this. All the time. I know a lot of the things that I don't do well, I just don't know exactly how to go about improving. 

**Watch replays:** I'll try to start doing this. 

**Train:** I spend a LOT of time in free play. I feel like I should do more custom training, however. I just don't know what trainings are the best for the things I need to work on. It's irritating that the menu doesn't have a search function. 

**Work on rotations/positioning:** I think I'm good with rotations as my playlist of choice is standard. I'm currently D3 in 3's, I just happened to hit Champ in 2's first (I play it less so I ranked up there faster). I try very hard not to over-extend and leave the backfield open.

And playing some unranked to get some tips/advice would probably help.",,,,diamond3,,False,,True,,,,,False,,True,t3_6qw16a,,,,,,,,,Used to be Champ,,1501599572.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1503670342.0,,,

I got Mayhem - It's Murder in my recommended feed about a week later, and checked it out. I loved the track, and looked deeper for more.

A while later, I *tried* to get into Renard, but it was wayyy too hardcore for me, so I stuck with FIAB, Mayhem, Kitsune^2, and Jackal Queenston for the time being.

I listened to Renard - The Club and it got me hooked on the rest of their discog. After falling in love with Renard, I found out about TQBF, and feel in love even more.

From that point on, Ren has easily been not only my favorite artist, but my biggest influence.

Many songs have emotional connections now, too. [This playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTzgGj9kYg4X2hdj680HAFzGgKWJo-4AV) contains *most* of the tracks I have connections with.

&gt;
&gt;So I took a mini impromptu poll in the Stamps/Ticats (RIP to the latter) Game Thread last night about the idea of starting up a CFL Spotify account.
&gt;
&gt;Basically the idea centres around this: Spotify is an emerging platform that is heavily driving and changing the way we consume and listen to music. Playlists have become a huge tool for promotion and their social influence is growing increasingly more and more. The pitfalls in Spotify's business model right now are converting the older generation into subscribers and the pitfalls of the CFL's model are converting the millennial generation into viewers. I think here we could find a happy medium where both entities benefit from a collaboration and increased awareness.
&gt;
&gt;The idea is simple. Create 9 general playlists for the 9 teams that will have guest hosts weekly. (IE. Simoni Lawrence chooses the TiCats playlist one week, Zach Collaros the next, etc etc... again... RIP TiCats). Aligning the athletes with musicians who have social influence while providing those musicians with an ROI for acknowledging they've been added to the playlist I honestly feel would be a good way to turn the millennial generation eyeballs to the CFL.
&gt;
&gt;Conversely, as I said, Spotify has been pushing to convert more and more of the boomer generation to their platform. This is where I thin the concept of a ""Legends"" Playlist comes in. Once or twice a month have someone along the lines of Flutie, Pinball, etc etc guest host a playlist and just slap together a bunch of their favourite music.
&gt;
&gt;This seems to me like a really easy, cheap (literally free baring any official partnership with Spotify down the road), and untapped market that the CFL hasn't attempted to penetrate yet. I've reached out to the league about the idea and the possibility of myself spearheading it (and maybe get the always loveable photoshop wizard /u/omegatron20xx to help me design some playlist covers), but I have yet to hear back from them. If I don't I may just take this project under my own wing and do it myself [Insert Stach is a DJ Joke Here]. I have the contact info of enough players in the league that I definitely thing we could trial it for at least half a season to see the type of response it gets then re-pitch to the league.
&gt;
&gt;But as always, I want to know what you loveable misfits think. Is this something you guys would be interested in seeing done? Lemme know your thoughts.
&gt;
&gt;Cheers!

His disorder meant that he really doesn't like, and can't really deal, with things changing.

He talked about listening to music a lot in the AmA, I'm sure after the sheer amount of time spent listening to the same band that he developed a very deep emotional connection. It could have just been to much for him once he heard that.

So, do this mean that I need to work on improving my upper level reading ability?

Thus far I have taken the advice of practicing fundamentals to heart...but could it be that I have conversely not spent enough time on pushing my upper limit?

I understand raising my lower levels will result in growing my upper levels...doing well on easier songs will improve my fundamentals and I will do better on harder songs.

But, I have received input multiple times that according to my ability and play time I should be able to play harder songs than I currently can do.

So, contrary to common advice...should I try pushing my boundaries and try harder songs? 

Or should I just keep doing songs that I think are easy to build fundamentals? 

I understand a balance is necessary, but I think my balance is off. 

Thoughts?

Well, I will probably play these maps again sober. I keep a playlist for the sole purpose of organizing songs I know I could do better on, and did poorly due to being drunk - because I play drunk a lot.

Madeon. The kid is fucking amazing. Seeing him live x3 has brought together my close high school friends and I from multiple states since graduating undergrad. We saw the Advenutre tour, when he opened for Zedd (holy fuck that was A+), we saw shelter live front row balcony at Royal Oak (MI, the smallest venue on the shelter tour,). Yes, that was so good I still giggle thinking about it. 

I'm 24 now, were all growing older. But you know, I cant forget those nights. Since undergrad I've realized time is precious, going to these concerts with my close friends was amazing. Were we sober? No. But still to this day we talk about how fucking good it was. Were we 25ft away from Madeon on two occasions? Yes. Did we see the acapella shelter explode into Language from the balcony at shelter? Ohhh yes 

Its inspired my research into other artists, we all have a shared spotify EDM playlist. On those dark grad school nights when your exhausted from studying I push on. Finish your degree, go to those festivals you dream of. Be with your friends. The financial means to attend are close to your future. I have to earn it.

Madeon stared as our shared artist. The city, Icarus. He is 2 yrs younger than me but insanely gifted.   He stemed into soooo many other artists. And yeah, Illenium, Porter, Tritonal, etc all are   common names on this sub reddit. I don't care, I like what I like. 

10 years from now were gonna be holding our kids. Sipping some brews laughing about that one time we rolled and saw Madeon/Porter live. I know I'll smile. Its not going to be because the drugs felt good. Its going to be because of that memory when the music was too good to believe when we all looked at each other. No words were spoken. Mouths agape b/c some 22 y/o french kid blew us away.  

I've lost contact with many friends from undergrad. But not these guys. They are my crew :)  

Cheers to the next adventure my amigos

We have a side wager going on where if the Celtics win, they get the rights to Boris Diaw's cappuccino machine but if the Spurs win, they get the rights to Jimmy Butler's Taylor Swift Spotify Playlist..... High stakes for sure

**1st Quarter**

* We start out the game rocky with neither team really getting anything going offensively. Enes has a clear advantage with Zach Randolph so far and he leads all scorers with 8 1st Quarter Points. Wiggins is having difficulty with Marcus Smart's thicc self and coughs up the ball a couple times. Melo tells Marcus Smart he doesn't know what thicc is and nails a couple mid-range jumpers over Jimmy to end the quarter

* Spurs - 19, Celtics - 16

**2nd Quarter**

* We start the quarter with Terry Rozier whispering into Rondo's ear ""Brad likes me more"". Quite hurtful but it doesn't really do anything to either player since Brad Stevens isn't involved here in any way shape or form. We move on...

* Both teams go small to start the quarter. Celtics quickly adjust with moving Marquesse Chriss onto Wilson Chandler. Spurs get burnt with Crawford getting point guard minutes and see the ball getting stuck on consecutive possessions. Spurs make up their lost lead by pushing the ball in transition nicely with Rondo but in half court sets, they aren't seeing too much success scoring the ball. Carmelo jab steps, winks at Lala and nails the long two to close out the quarter

* Celtics - 42, Spurs - 39

**3rd Quarter**

* Both teams know there are high stakes in this game. Celtics don't want to go home without T-Swift and they start playing like it. Jimmy gets hot to start the quarter by taking advantage of Wiggins and Melo's defensive shortcomings. Spurs quickly call timeout and sub in Wilson Chandler for defense. This quarter has been tug of war, neither team being able to take advantage on the boards

* Celtics - 66, Spurs - 59

**4th Quarter**

* Spurs are the ones opening this quarter hot. Diaw must've yelled at them in french. According to the translator he said ""long live the cappuccino, death to the popstar""

* James Ennis is the bee's knee's at the start of the 4th. His ability to slide into the small ball lineup and give Jimmy Butler some time to rest on the bench has been vital. He knocks down 2 three's in the quarter and forces Melo into some bad shots. Jimmy Buckets re-enters the game and nails a corner three. He jogs down the other way and looks Diaw straight in the eyes. ""I fucking hate cappuccinos""

* Celtics lead 7 with 2 minutes left. Spurs trout out Rondo-Wiggins-Chandler-Melo-Kanter and Celtics trout out Smart-Lavine-Butler-Warren-Randolph. Rondo gets a screen from Melo and gets the mismatch with Lavine. Melo jabs and rises for the three and gets the lucky bounce. Spurs down 4 with 1:42. Celtics come back up the floor and try to waste shot clock but end up settling for a bad Marcus Smart 3. Spurs come back up the floor, down 4 and Rondo tries to find the hot man. Melo gets the ball on the block with Jimmy guarding him. Melo shimmies and turns around but misses the jumper but luckily Kanter tips out the rebound and Spurs get a fresh shot clock. Rondo this time gets a pick from Kanter who clobbers Lavine on the screen, no call and we play on. Kanter gets the ball rolling to the rim but gets fouled by Z-Bo with 36 seconds left. Enes goes 1 for 2 at the line and has his team down 3. Celtics don't call a timeout and we're going down the floor. Jimmy calls for the ball being guarded by Chandler and asks for a screen from Randolph. Jimmy pulls up for a mid-range and gets hit on the elbow by Enes and he goes to the line to put the Celtics up 5. Spurs call a timeout and draw up a 3 pointer from Melo. Melo gets the ball but has Jimmy breathing down his neck. Melo steps back and gets a clean look but hits front rim. Warren gets the board, hits his free throws and that's all she wrote. Celtics steal Game 1 and Diaw's cappuccino maker

* Celtics - 93, Spurs - 85

**Players**

* Jimmy Butler - 28 Points (20 Second Half), 6 Rebounds, 3 Steals

* Zach Randolph - 12 Points, 13 Rebounds

* Zach Lavine - 15 Points, 5 Assists (6-12 FG)

* James Ennis - 11 Points (12 Minutes)

* Carmelo Anthony - 32 Points, 6 Rebounds

* Wilson Chandler - 19 Points, 2 Steals, 3 Blocks 

* Rajon Rondo - 8 Points, 10 Assists, 4 TO

t5_2qh16,,,,False,,,,,,,technology,,,,,,dkv0y0m,,,0,,,,Screye,False,,t1_dkux32w,1,,,,,,"&gt; what is the physical difference between a ""machine"" and a conscious being?

We as humans don't really understand what consciousness means, why it exists or if free will exists at all. For something so abstract, it is literally impossible to compare it to a fully defined machine. 

Computerphile has a wonderful set of videos on the topic. I will link then [here](https://youtu.be/tlS5Y2vm02c). There are some more by the same guy, but not listed as a proper playlist

&gt; how would we tell when a machine becomes conscious?

We can't really. What we can say, is that a machine is a thing in ways similar enough to us humans to consider it conscious.

Many AI researchers think that a super human AI will work in ways completely different from what many people think or is portrayed in movies. It will have an internal reward function and if a certain thing increases it's reward it will do it. See [this](https://youtu.be/tcdVC4e6EV4) video for more. 

&gt; especially since deep learning is often a black box?

That is very much a lie propagated by the media. Firstly, what neural nets and deep learning does is at its core no different from any other machine learning algorithm. 

When training a neural net, we can stop it at any point and check what the values at any node are and what they mean. [This](https://blog.keras.io/how-convolutional-neural-networks-see-the-world.html) is a great article visualizing how neural nets 'see' the data. 

Just because we don't initialize the parameters,, doesn't mean that we don't know how they change over time. 

&gt; we push parameters off a cliff and let them reach a value, couldn't we misunderstand the initial guidelines (what we literally tell it to do) enough so that we cannot predict what future value it settles on and/or how it gets there?

one of computerphile videos do discuss the difficulty in defining certain guidelines for highly Intelligent AI. 

As for pushing it off a cliff, we often don't even know what the mountain range looks like. So we literally push 1000s of balls off the cliff until one of them reaches a really low point and go with it. 

Since we always select the one with the best score on the problem that we want to solve. An algorithm that misunderstands our guidelines won't be able to get a good score in our tests. What we need to worry about is if it is too good at its job. 

_____ 

Let me give you an example of a very real and possible problem. This is how I think the AI crises might actually look unlike the terminator scenario. 

Let's say we have a stock managing bot that manages billions of dollars trying to beat the stock market. We already have people working on these so it might not even be that far away in the future.... Next decade even. 

Now one fine day the AI finds that selling a huge amount of stock in some company would lead to a huge growth of other stocks that it holds. But a side effect of the transaction is it destabilizes a certain economy. Your other stocks shoot up because they are all in competing economies to the one you are de stabilizing as a side effect. 

This would be some thing an AI would do, that you might not want him to do. So you put in a caveat. ' If the transaction is above X amount then it has to get approval from a person in charge'. Problem solved?? No ! 

Thing is,, the AI would eventually learn that such a limit exists. The prospective profits from the transaction are so large that to circumvent the limit, it will sell a lot is small related stocks instead and indirectly de stabilize the economy. The AI doesn't understand what it is doing, but to knows what events will lead to a desired outcome. 

In such ways innocent robots that have decision making capacity can cause a lot of collateral damage. The funny thing is, humans already do all these things. The US does it for oil and middle Eastern countries do it for religious proliferation. But, we turn a blind eye to them calling all rich and powerful people our evil overlords. 

But, how will you go about blaming an emotionless AI. It isn't good or bad. It isn't crazy.. Rather it is doing the one thing that will lead to the best reward, in a manner skin to a child's innocent curiosity. 

Humans have no cohesive way to define what is human like and what isn't.. When an AI finally arrives that will be making that choice on daily basis, we are suddenly faced with needing a common definition to matters of ethics and morals. Since we will never have those, we can never have a perfectly functioning AI.",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6pn2ni,,,,,,,,,,,1501278188.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1501932829.0,,,

I wound up trying out apple's music subscription which... idk if its really cheaper or not, I'm on the student plan... but it allows you to use all your music on all your devices all the time without needing to download them... *and* (and this is the part that surprised me) i could listen to all the songs iTunes has to offer and put them in playlists, download them, whatever... as if i owned them too. 
I mean with Spotify theres a bit of a workaround you had to do to listen to your music that Spotify didn't have, which is not something i ever got around to. And i have only a 16gb phone, i don't want to have all that extra downloaded music just to fill the gaps. But with the apple music thing its just all there, easy, and perfectly syncs to all devices.  (Well... apple devices anyways)
ill admit Spotify is much better with their premade playlists and such, and idk if you could even share playlists with the apple service. I wouldn't think so... but you also don't have that pesky problem that Spotify has with some artists refusing to work with them like Taylor swift or prince... 
so idk... it seems like a much better service imo. Radio is ok... it doesn't do a good job of duplicating all of spotifys features but if all you want to do is listen to your own music playlists, then it works just fine.
And since i got the apple watch, the first thing i thought while setting up my workout playlist on the thing was... this is essentially a very fancy nano. I guess if they really want to push the watches they would need to get rid of the nano which i bet is most used for people who workout anyways. 
But who knows maybe they're going to come out with a watch that is more ""simplified"" and cheaper to replace it. Kind of like how the fitbit has models with all the feature, all down to the models with just the basic tracking. 
So, maybe an apple watch with just tracking ability, music syncing, and basic phone and txt notifications. Maybe without a screen. But idk how you would sync bluetooth earbuds without a screen.

Walk around and find or have someone with the venue show you where your power outlets are the moment you walk into the venue.  *Terminology note: the actual name of the 15-20 amp power connector in North America is ""Edison"", the parlance can vary but I often say ""I need an Edison extension"" or ""hand me that tub of Edison"" etc*  
-If there is any wireless involved be aware of what it is and how to work with it (scan and change frequencies, etc).  Don't be afraid to pull up manuals and YouTube tutorials when on site if need be (out of the view of the client, of course), but try to have the information in front of you before if possible.  
-With the mixer you're using the big thing you are missing is output EQs, both for the mains and for the monitor mixes.  I would highly suggest bringing in a 31 band EQ for your outputs, for me that would be virtually indispensable.  If you can rustle up additional channels of 31 band for the monitor mixes too then that would be great, but getting some master control of your output is high priority in my opinion.  
-Be aware of the capability of your gear, but also be aware of its **LIMITATIONS**.  If someone asks for something that is not possible given the equipment on hand, don't be afraid to be honest about those limitations.  ""That is not possible with the gear we have rented in"" is a phrase I keep in my back pocket, especially on gigs where gear had to be minimized in order to keep the price tag low.  
-To most clients, everything that you do is magic; they will ask you to turn up the reverb on the vocal and turn down the echo of the room in the same breath with no idea how easy their first request is and how impossible their second request is.  You are not hired to teach people by any means, but if/when you run into a request that is not possible, save yourself the headache of trying to conjure a miracle and just be honest.

**On the wedding front:**  
-**Know who your wedding planner is.**  This person will be your point of contact during the event.  They will tell you when (not if) things change, and you need to be proactive about reaching out to them and making sure you have all the scheduling information that they have as they have it.  Get their phone number and have them take yours if you can.  This person is your life line.  Bouquet toss, introductions, when dinner is served, cake cutting; those and other things will be on your planners schedule.  Make sure they are on yours as well.  
-Make the band provide house music.  I would suggest having a playlist of your own ready to go too, but it really is way better if the band furnishes that.  That way you don't end up playing a song during break that they play during their set.  If you *do* end up having to provide house music, have the bandleader check over your playlist and make sure that there is no overlap (unless the bandleader doesn't care, in which case neither do you).  
-Try to find out *in a polite way* who is actually bankrolling the whole event.  This is not a huge deal since you should be trying to please everyone, but if push comes to shove it can be valuable knowing who is actually writing the checks.  
-Mix quiet, turn up when told.  As a fellow metal-head this is something I have to keep at the front of my mind when doing wedding gigs.  Depending on the venue I will often do the first set with only a small selection of instruments in the PA at all.  If the place is partying and having a good time once they've got some drinks in them, then pump it at that point.  Being conservative is the name of the game here.  
-Find out who will be doing announcements and if there will be any speeches or anything like that.  If there are speeches then don't be afraid to be explicit or even insistent about where people need to stand when holding the mic (like, not directly in front of the speakers for example).  Also be ready to show people *how* to hold a mic.  ""Make sure to keep the mic up to your mouth and speak loudly and clearly"".  They probably won't do it even if you tell them, but you should give it the old college try anyway.  
-If you have to make any announcements yourself then WRITE THAT SHIT DOWN before you say it.  Even if it is a simple greeting or introduction.  I have done 'voice of god' for hundreds of gigs, and nothing helps me do it effectively better than having what I need to say, no matter how simple, written down in front of me.  
-Some venues have a curfew, find out if you have to be cleared out of the space at any special time.  Make sure they don't expect you to be out the moment the reception is over.  
-Cheers to you for asking about dinner.  Getting yourself fed on a gig is something that I think too many people play fast and loose with.  You have to power your body, and you should not be shy about making sure that gets taken care of.  
-Remember that, unlike a club gig or a normal concert, in a wedding you are a very small cog in a machine that wants very badly to not be aware of your existence.  This is not a bad thing.  There is an event that is much larger and much more important than you going on around you, so allow yourself to fade into your comparatively unimportant responsibilities and keep your eyes open for the people that are actually making the decisions and calling shots.  Do what you're told, don't try for the impossible, and stay chill.  

Also, it doesn't hurt to see if you can grab a drink from the (hopefully open) bar...",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6psi2i,,,,,,,,,,,1501151544.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1501886184.0,,,

Better late than never right?? Boy was it a world wind of emotions. I started to type out a whole long post about everything leading up to the day of but, it was getting a little too winded so I’ll give a breakdown below and if anyone has questions I’d be more than happy to expand!

We had a very intimate ceremony (immediate family only, with the except of my favorite aunt on my husband's side of the family) and reception (only close friends and immediate family, less than 40 people).


**BUDGET** &lt;$6,000

**TOTAL COST** $5800 (ish)

Most of the total cost was my dress and his suit. 

We did a breakfast themed buffet and had mini donuts and muffins and cookies. 

We only invited immediate family to the ceremony and close friends to the reception. I think we had about &lt;40 people ish at the reception and it was glorious. I had time to eat and mingle and not worry about ""did I talk to so and so"" blah blah.

Did DIY centerpieces with bulk flowers from Sam's Club and some giant ass lanterns from World Market, random candlestick holders from lots of thrifting adventures, and some good smelling candles that were on clearance from Target.

**What went right**

* I got to marry the love of my life

* The photographer did an AMAZING job of capturing our wedding ceremony and I didn’t even realize she was there most of the time. Sneaky snake taking good pictures!

* Nothing got set on fire!! A lot of the candle stick holders didn’t have anything to catch the wax dripping so we had to set mini paper plates under them. I wasn’t thrilled about this but didn’t end up caring once all was said and done.

* All 6 sets of my parents showed up (noticed I said my parents… you’ll see what I mean in the ‘what went wrong’ section)

* Everyone had a blast and got up to dance and mingle and no one was singled out/ignored.

* The food was DELICIOUS and we had an abundance of food/treats. We did a breakfast buffet including egg casserole (probably least eaten food, kind of was expecting this), biscuits &amp; gravy, hash browns, bacon, and sausages. For deserts we were all about mini-everything. Mini blueberry &amp; lemon poppy seed muffins, mini orange rolls, mini cinnamon rolls, mini cake donuts with buttercream frosting &amp; maple bacon frosting, and decorated cookies. Thankfully I didn’t have to push them off on other people they asked to take some home.

* It was 80* and sunny! For those of you unfamiliar with Iowa/Midwest weather, who the heck knows that the weather will be like. It snowed three days before our wedding and I started to panic because our wedding was an hour away from the reception and the reception area was half outside. I took a leap of faith that the weather would cooperate and thank the stars it did.

* I spent MONTHS getting the playlists perfect. I mean MONTHS, and only had it perfected about two days before the party. Any spare moment I had was being put into this because I wanted everything to flow well and had to consider what music we liked, what our guest would like (since we had quite the age mix). The music was a huge hit with everyone there and I’ve had several people ask for the link to it.

* The Bluetooth speaker was just big enough that it was literally perfect for the amount of space we had. Just loud enough for the dance party, but not so loud that the people on the other side of the lodge couldn’t hold a conversation without yelling.

* No seating charts meant people can sit and talk to whoever they want to! I wasn’t about to make so and so sit by so and so because so and so didn’t want to sit by so and so.  

**What went not-so-right**

* I HATED the photographer who did our engagement pictures. His pictures were nice enough but he was getting ready to move and I feel like just didn’t put any effort into getting nice pictures and some were over-edited….. He didn’t really listen to the type of pictures/feel we wanted. He was also a bit of a creep. I’m glad we went with the photographer we did for the actual wedding day.

* We had a dinner the night before so all our parents could meet. I’m adopted so I invited my bio-mom, my mom and stepdad, my dad and stepmom, husband’s parents (who are divorced but back together, it’s a long story), husband’s brother, and both of our nephews. Husband’s mom was super rude and just not very nice the entire dinner and left early without even really saying anything. I have a hunch that she was (and still is) mad that I took her sweet precious baby away from her. 

* We were late to our own wedding (only by 10 minutes) but still. When you get married in the middle of nowhere, make sure you download or print a map because your phone will lose signal and you’ll miss your turn.

* Husband’s mom came dressed like she was trying to out dress me with a more adult-y prom dress.

* Husband’s parents didn’t show up to the reception because they thought they weren’t invited. (they were, they even RSVP’ed what song they wanted to be played! We even talked to them about it the weekend before!)

* We planned for about 50 people from the RSVP’s and only had about 35 guests. A few people called us the night before/that morning to let us know they had an emergency/work thing and couldn’t make it. Understandable, but still bummed. And then husband’s parents and brother just decided to not show up.

* TONS of food leftover. We lived off the remaining breakfast food for almost two weeks’ worth of dinners. We also ate our deserts over the course of 2-3 weeks, that is also after I brought some to work to get rid of. We were breakfast &amp; treated out to the max. I couldn’t do it anymore and just decided to throw what little was left away.

* We could only get the Bluetooth speaker to pair to my husband’s phone. I had the Spotify playlist downloaded onto my phone and computer and naturally we didn’t pair it with either before the party. This wasn’t a huge deal but I was concerned it would become an issue due to being in the middle of nowhere and not getting reception. 

* We forgot a wine bottle opener!!!!! I had to send my dad to go to the closest store (about 10-15 min away) to get one.

* We under estimated how many people liked the white wine we got and it was gone in about an hour. I’m pretty sure we still have 5 bottles of red wine in our garage. All of the other alcohol was gone before the end of the night.

* The glow sticks we bought off amazon were awful. Okay, let me rephrase… the glow sticks were great! The glow sticks glasses set we bought didn’t glow for shit and I ended up returning them after opening 10 and not having any of the glow sticks glow. We improvised and used the regular glow sticks as a substitute.



TLDR: My semi-casual wannabe 90’s rave wedding party was a huge hit.

&gt; Chicago based producer Walkingshoe delivers his Cosmonostro debut with the Blastphemy EP – 7 tracks of sound experimentation and innovation: these are RAW beats, oozing with flavour, for those that like to take a less conventional musical trip.

&gt; We open with the laidback grooves of ‘Facebearer’ – a slice of pulsing disco from the distant future, with immaculate, glittering vibraphone chops over rolling low end &amp; gorgeous 360 degree percussion. Title track ‘Blastphemy’ ups the ante with a gloriously disorienting mixture of slow and fast rhythms, before dropping back into a warped &amp; stretched disco groove that’ll make you melt. Things get more warped still in ‘The Falls’ &amp; ‘General’, where lo-fi meets sci-fi over pushed grooves that’ll have your neck snapping. ‘Tennassee’ takes us on a chilling detour, with what sounds like the soundtrack for an 8-bit slasher movie, whilst ‘Occasions’ takes another complete u-turn – eastern vibes meet Wyclef Jean before dropping into lush piano chords over throbbing beats &amp; heavily compressed plucked strings chopped to perfection. Rounding off the EP is ‘The Blaster’, sounding like a galactic jazz group playing Numbers On The Boards, complete with beautiful ethereal vocal chops &amp; more of that pulsing low-end goodness.

""*Oh, well, maybe we can still win if we just believe!*""

*T2 in off lane falls at 10 minutes*

Even a really good team probably can't get enough farm before 15 minutes to be able to properly push inhibitors unless you just give up and start feeding. Likely the match will drag on another 5-10 minutes after you can surrender but your team refuses to.

But! A better solution is what Overwatch has implemented in their Competitive playlist. If a player leaves in the preparation phase of the first round of the match, the match simply ends and teams are sent back to the menus. If a player leaves during the match, there is an amount of time for the player to rejoin before being penalized (a bit short IMO, but that's a rant for another subreddit), after that point the players in match can leave. They will still take a loss and lose SR, but they won't have to sit through the rest of match where they get stomped in a 5v6, and they won't receive a leaving penalty (i.e. bans, 75% XP reduction for all modes).

Being able to leave and queue for another match or just leave and take a break without a penalty after someone disconnects and doesn't rejoin for ~2 minutes would be huge.",,,,hero-sevarog,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6p3ex2,,,,,,,,,Sevarog,,1500883806.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1501515451.0,,,

I'm terrible at PvP (and PvE, to be honest) in this game, but I've played other games competitively and know that playing people worse than you just makes you worse.

I don't get this aversion to SBMM - or maybe I just don't understand this FPS aversion to 'sweating' (or 'trying', as it's more usually known). If I was good at the game I'd be looking for great people to play so I could get even better. As it is I'm still trying to grind my way to average, but there you go.

If I'd put a significant amount of time into learning the PvP side of the game, however, I certainly wouldn't be thinking ""I'm good enough now, I can stop learning"".

I'm old, my reactions are gone, and I just play games for fun now - but a 'sweaty' match that pushes me all the way (which is sadly not that far!) is still what I'm looking for. And the only way I'll slowly improve.

But, hey, what do I know. And I'm certainly aware that restaurants don't have menus because everybody likes the same things. I'd have had separate ranked (SBMM) and unranked (CBMM) playlists, with no drops, quest progression, or XP gains in the unranked. Seemed obvious to me...

At my most bitter I think that maybe if we took mental afflictions as seriously as physical ones, I wouldn't have to be trapped in my head the way I am. That's a whole new can of worms, though.

The problem doesn't lie with my best friend in the least. I absolutely love and adore him in the utmost platonic sense, he's wonderful. The rational part of my brain knows that he feels exactly the same way about me, and he's proven that over and over again. He knows practically everything about me, and he's been a comfort through all the times in the past when I used to self-harm, drink, and then call him sobbing at 4 am because I hated myself. In fact after talking to you guys on here, I had a pretty good conversation with him, and even met up with him earlier today.

Unfortunately all the rational, logical knowledge in world doesn't stand up to my trust issues. I've been burned badly before and I know he wouldn't ever hurt me, but I keep trying to push him out because I'm scared. It's not fair to him or to our friendship but I can't help it.

I'm so sorry for venting! It's been almost 2 years since I've spoken to someone about things, so the words keep flowing out. I'll stop now :)

Music is such a bright spot for me! I'm constantly creating new playlists for different emotions, different situations, different times of day, and people absolutely love it when I share with them.

t5_2vq0w,,,,False,,,,,,,DestinyTheGame,,,,,,dklz8zu,,,0,,,,IAmTheMasterVader,False,,t3_6ozsij,2,,,,,,"&gt; Bungie still has NO idea why ~~we~~ **I** like their game

Easy partner, you don't speak for everyone. I'm not sure what ""we"" are supposed to like about Destiny, but I'm sure you're about to tell me.

&gt; Three years on and Bungie is apparently still trying to make a game that nobody wants.

Clearly wrong. If nobody wanted it, Destiny playlists and the Beta would be ghost towns. Supply meets demand.

&gt; Gjally, Vex, Fatebringer, Last Word, Suros, Thorn, Grasp, Doctrine, Hopscotch, Felwinter's Lie, Clever Dragon...all of these weapons were fun as hell to find and use. Bungie nerfed and/or killed them all **because the community complained incessantly about X gun being OP (read: they were killed a lot by it) and that it needed to be nerfed.**

Fixed that for ya. There's plenty of threads documenting this phenomenon over the years; either you're blissfully ignorant, or willfully ignoring it.

&gt; Now with Destiny 2 it seems they are doubling down on the universal nerf of EVERYTHING that made Destiny fun.

Fun is subjective. Fun to you may not be fun to the next guardian. Moreover, as I stated previously, every nerf was preceded by months of calls from the community to nerf X gun or Y ability. It is fair to assume that, in each scenario, *somebody* was not having fun in the current meta, and that the subsequent nerf made Destiny more fun for them (until the next meta was solved, and they started lobbying for another nerf).

If nerfs make Destiny unfun, then why has the community spent years pushing for them? Masochism? It seems that such a nerf happy community would find Destiny 2's alleged nerf fest to be a blast, no?

&gt;  I guess it will be balanced though. But other than a tiny percentage, who really cares about true balance?

See above. The endless calls for nerfs were to make Destiny 1 more balanced. You mean to tell us that only a ""tiny percentage"" wanted the nerfs of the past? Nonsense. If an asymmetric PvP meta was so enjoyable, why did we ever push to nerf SUROS or Vex? Balance makes the game fair, and is better for the mental health of a scrub. You get killed by a meta gun in Destiny? ""Of course they're using X, that's why I lost."" You get killed by a gun in a balanced game? Only option is to get good.

&gt; Destiny is not that type of game. It's about using space magic and finding rare crazy OP weapons and having fun. That was always a part of Destiny 1 and that's why ~~most people~~ **I** stuck around.

Fixed another one for you. Your opinion != everyone's opinion.

&gt; To my original point, I don't think Bungie ever intended the game to be like it was...they wanted a balanced, competitive social shooter - basically a Halo 2.0. But that's not what we got and that's not why we all sunk a crazy amount of hours into a game that, quite frankly, lacked in content. We did so because the menial tasks of the game were still fun because of the mechanics and we had the chance to get an OP weapon.

Once again, *you* feel this way, not everyone does. There are so many different people who play Destiny. Trying to say ""everyone liked it because unbalanced PvP play and overpowered exotics"" is simply not true.

Bungie has spent years hearing the community complain about unbalanced meta followed by unbalanced meta. In response, they make the sequel a balanced game to appease them. What does the community do? Complain about balance.

Bungie is not the problem, the community is.

t5_2qofj,,,,1500781648,,,,,,,spotify,,,,,,dkldulp,,,0,,,,bytebodger,False,,t3_6oz9kc,28,,,,,,"(TLDR: This can be ""fixed"" with the API.)
 
Spotify offers a fairly-robust API (Application Programming Interface).  It's easy to use (if you're the coding type) and it's pretty well documented.  The API offers you the ability to actually push songs/playlists to your live music player in real time.  It also allows you to query all of the existing playlists and their accompanying tracks.  So here's what I did:
 
1. On my local machine, I installed the free PHP SDK (Software Development Kit) that's available on GitHub.  I then registered for a ""developer account"" on Spotify (it's free and only takes a minute or two).
2. Once I had the basic handshake (login) working via the API (this probably took me 30 minutes to get working), I pulled back all of my existing playlists (I currently have about a dozen set up).  
3. Once you've accessed the playlist, you can then pull a list of ALL the tracks that live under that playlist.  I simply dumped them into an array and shuffled them.  (Note:  I did a simple and true shuffle.  Not a song-by-song randomization.  If we use a deck-of-cards analogy, this means that I literally shuffled the songs in the playlist as I would shuffle cards in a deck before playing a hand of poker.  The overall order of the tracks is changed every time - but there is only ever one representation of each track during each go-through.  You wouldn't want to play a hand of poker where the ace of spades could, theoretically, be dealt out two or three - or more - times in the same hand.  And I don't want to listen to a ""shuffled"" playlist where the same song could be played two or three - or more - times in the same session.)
4. Once you have the newly-shuffled (REALLY shuffled) list of all the tracks in your playlist, you can push them back to your live Spotify player as a new Play Queue.  And they will ALL play in the completely-randomized order that was created from your code.  This means that once you've heard Smells Like Teen Spirit in your Totally Awesome Grunge playlist, you will never hear it again until either 1) you switch to a new playlist, or 2) you listen to all the songs in the playlist and you restart it from scratch.
5. What happens if, for some reason, I don't like the truly-shuffled order of tracks that was created by my homemade shuffler?  Simple.  I just rerun the web page utility that launches these API calls and voila!  I have a newly-created, truly-shuffled version of the same list in the Play Queue of my Spotify player.
6. There seems to be a hard-limit on the number of tracks that Spotify will show you in the player.  That limit is 80 in the current version.  But I have confirmed that if I push a playlist to the Spotify player with, say, 300 tracks in it, it will keep all 300 of those tracks in the (newly-randomized) order that was generated in my code.  So when the Play Queue reaches the 80th track in the list, it will reload the Queue with the next 80 tracks from my manually-created, truly-shuffled list.  But since it's not doing a ""fresh"" shuffle from scratch (with its own janky algorithm), this means that none of the tracks in the first group of 80 will ever show up in the second group of 80 (or the third, or the fourth, or the...)

I know that this comment isn't immediately-helpful for the ""average"" user just trying to play their Spotify music without becoming a software engineer in the process.  But I wanted to throw this up here to benefit anyone who knows how to leverage this knowledge before I can create a publicly-accessible solution, because I know that this is a huge pain-point for many users and Spotify doesn't seem to care about it in the least.  And I don't consider repeatedly copying-and-pasting my playlists into randomizing outside tools to be a meaningful solution to the problem.  
 
On one hand, it's nice that they have a robust API that will allow the technorati to ""fix"" this issue.  On the other hand, I really consider this to be a massive blunder on their part as a company.  Winamp did this feature beautifully - more than 15 years ago.  This is such a simple feature and people have been clamoring for it for YEARS.  The answers to your product's shortcomings should never be, ""Here.  We created an API for the tech-savvy to use.  Now go fix it yourself.""",,,,,,False,,True,,,,,False,,True,t3_6oz9kc,,,,,,,,,,,1500780912.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1501485501.0,,,

Resources

My workout regimen has been PUSH-PULL-LEGS-ARMS-SHOULDERS-CARDIO/ABS-REST forever, and it's been doing me good so far.  If it ain't broke, don't fix it. 

I'm a big EDM-festival junkie while also being huge into rap and hip hop.  My latest workout playlist is actually my own mix (I've been dabbling into DJing and producing as well).  Check it out if you'd like to see what my taste in music is.  It's definitely not for everyone, but it's great for crushing PRs.

Putting on a Pepsi shirt and then expecting Pepsi to pay you, as if they're watching videos looking for people advertising them, would be downright moronic, and I have no idea why you're choosing to argue against that idea when there's absolutely no push coming from me there.

What I was referring to is doing essentially what they do on Twitch, where companies pay people to wear their caps/shirts, stick a watermark in the corner, etc.

In this context nobody is putting a sticker on their mic and just hoping to be paid. They would contact companies and make deals with those companies who will pay a fee to have that product placement. Y'know, like literally every product placement deal ever. It already happens  with companies sending their stuff for free to artists who then go on to advertise them. Hell, it's the only reason 3dio has survived so long. 

On top of that, I do have YouTube Red, which is completely irrelevant in the context of this conversation because Red can't cut out ads inside of videos. We're talking about ads that asmr artists attach to their videos, not random YT ads. As I explained above, going from ""*whisper whisper whisper*"" to ""and now I want to show you this new game I've been playing where touch your phone here and listen to this thing explode"" will ensure video being totally ignored after the first view and not going on playlists that would garner more views. To quote what I actually said, I was talking about ""when a video cuts to an ad half way through, or starts/finishes with an advertising segment"". The actual video, not the gaps between videos.

The relationship that was being pushed was forced. If they'd kept it at a playful banter and some sexual tension I think that could have been great. The constant ""Will you marry me?"" and the playlist discussions were just too forced and slowed the movie down too much. 

The story was ok as well. I understand now why some early reviews were talking about how it was all universe building and very little story. You set up this grand scale backstory with the space station and talking about all of these alien races.... and then nothing is really done with them. The station never really seemed to be in danger and the setting could have been anywhere. I thought the motivation for the bad guy was fairly underwhelming too. A lot of the side characters that we met seemed like they'd have an interesting part to play but then they disappeared as well. 

If this turns into a franchise then I think they've got a great start for spin offs and far more interesting stories to tell. If this is truly a standalone effort then it really needed more time in the over.

I think the sentiment most people have here is true, that the attention grabbing songs are towards the front of the album, and the, aptly named, ""deep cuts"" go towards the back. I think this is less a case of the band saying, ""we're putting our GOOD songs at the beginning and our BAD ones at the end,"" because I don't think bands/musicians at the level of The Clash (or Kamasi Washington, Panda Bear, etc) have any desire to put out a song they don't love. 

The way I see it, the beginning of the album is there to get you hooked. In London Calling's case, it has the title track, a short, punky second track, some upbeat reggae/ska jams, a couple slower songs. As a kid, side C and D totally lost me, though. I wanted angry, brash songs and was presented with ""Lost in the Supermarket"" and ""Koka Kola"". As I've grown older, and grown with the album, I can safely say it's a masterpiece from front to back. Yes, not every song on it sounds like what you would expect a Clash song to sound like, but that's the beauty of it. The Clash had no obligation to put out a double LP, they wanted to. They took a loss in profit so it could be released, selling the album for the price of a single LP. They pushed their musical boundaries, and they put out an album that they wanted to. 

To answer the second part of your question regarding patience, I don't think it's anyone's fault if you can't sit down and take in a 65+ minute album. I think there is a time and a place for all music. That's why singles are released. If you're just trying to enjoy a range of music, throw on a playlist. If you're trying to experience and album, you need to be in the right mood for it.

Their goal is to make the free service as unusable as possible without pushing you to get rid of it right away. They want you to gradually become fed up and suicidal at the thought of using it ever again right at the time that you've become habituated to it and have all your music and podcasts set up on it so that you buy the premium version to make the bad parts stop.

SPOILERS: they don't stop. Spotify sucks all the way through. They haven't fixed problems that have existed and have HUNDREDS of forum posts in their help sections for over a year. The company is majorly in debt and can't afford customer support, bug fixing, implementation of ui features, fixing broken ui features, or improving their algorithms. Spotify played so much shitty music on its custom and random playlists that I was skipping more tracks than not. I skip MAYBE a track or two an hour on pandora at most. I've gone days without disliking any of the dozens of new tracks pandora plays for me (I've  never paid for pandora, and I use an adblocker most of the time).

Also, spotify starts every random playlist with the same first song as last time. And the same second song. All the way up to the last song you played. if you listened for a few hours, you better be ready to scroll down for a while before you find where you left off--and you'll have to scroll further next time, and further the next time. This is retarded and makes no sense, right? Yeah, it's been that way since I first used spotify over a year ago. I paid for it for months before narrowly avoiding suicide by canceling the service and picturing myself graphically murdering the company's stock price until it gets bought by a local mom and pop pizza shop for the patents to use in organizing their separate playlists for the weekend music and the weekly music.

Supers take much longer to build now, the former special weapons are now combined with the old heavy weapons in the ""power weapon"" slot, jumps feel slower.  Even in PvP, I miss the fun chaos of 6v6.  There really isn't a PvP playlist now where you can just goof off in.

Even though I had a bad experience yesterday, I am all for changing up this inflated winstreak system. If I win 2 games it shouldn’t immediately bump me 2 whole ranks up in matchmaking. That should happen AS you rank up. Not before you rank. This creates a huge wall in the ranking system that shouldn’t be there. 

If Im a certain rank, i should have to beat the players at that rank to advance. Period. Once I get to the next rank, and I start loosing to that rank, then I know where I stand. I dont care if Im constantly switching back and forth from plat 3 to diamond 1. I just know when I get bumped all the way down to plat 2, and start playing against plat 2 players, it creates bad habits. Then I push back all the way to diamond 2’s, its a completely different game pace.

 I know I should be adapting, but its just so damn different that I feel trapped in my improvements.

I’m guilty of being a MM purchaser who got discouraged in February when all my original wayhomies dropped out, and I sold my pass for promises of a more enjoyable lineup down in Boston. Well BC came and went, and I cannot deny it was magical, but it was not my Wayhome. 


When the lineup was first announced I was discouraged when (at first look) it didn’t have very many hard hitters for me. Even though I had sold my ticket, I still came to this sub and read your write-ups as you guys shared your wayhomework. Through this I realized that Spotify had been suggesting artists on the lineup via the discover weekly playlist for years, not 1, but 7 artists I have saved over the years that I just never gave the time of day to other then the songs I had on repeat that I didn’t even know the name of. 


As June crept in I found myself mentally trying to budget the money to buy another ticket, camping pass and the gas from Fredericton to Oro. At that time the only feasible way I could see it happening was to eat rice for the entirety of July. Then came the contests! I entered first the PUP contest to no avail, remember clicking someone’s post which in turn brought me to the Tegan and Sara contest and put together that there were a bunch going on. Recruited my all-star contest winner pals /u/krissp and /u/p0tat0eboy who went on to win the grand prize in The Shins and Tegan and Sara subreddits (love u guys). 


So as of today, I have a full wayhomie crew spanning the east with friends flying/driving in from St. John’s NL, Halifax, Moncton, and Ottawa. I have a jam packed music schedule for the weekend. Heck I’m even running a craft beer exchange Friday morning (shameless plug - https://www.facebook.com/events/315421575577506/).

You always hear ""show don't tell"" or ""actions speak louder than words"" but with depressed people, especially an SO, they will twist it in their minds that these actions are done for personal benefit, they aren't really doing them for me(Why would anyone want to do anything special for me right?), or that you are just going through the motions of what is expected in social interactions and really wish more than anything that you two just never got together because you're in a trap where you care just enough that you aren't willing to abandon them, but you really wish you could be dating a normal person and that you'll break up with her any day now. 

You have to be transparent and tell her that you ARE there for her, and that you do want to help her out. You have to tell her that she shouldn't have to excessively apologize for everything(Although you should make up after any sort of fight)- key word ""excessively""

Another thing, sorry to break it to you, but the fact that she hates herself isn't the problem, it's a symptom. Nearly everyone with depression experiences self-loathing. You may not ever know the root of the problem, and she may not either. My therapist said to me when I started going to one that more often than not for people with depression, it's genetic, and if you have the genes for depression all it takes is some sort of event in your life or for others its just puberty and a fact of growing up and depression will settle in for its first time. *after re-reading your paragraph again it seems that she just got a double-whammy of depression and chronic pain that feed into each other* :(


&gt;She's been feeling like she hates herself. She lashes out because she feels like she needs to drive me away from her, because she doesn't feel like she's worth me ""dealing with her."" She said this herself, too, so it's legitimate.

That's probably fairly spot-on and just as I stated before, when she tries to drive you away from her, always follow back to her. If you can make it seem to her that you are not so much a separate entity in her life that she has to constantly worry about and think about like everything else in her life she probably does, but as someone who is going to help her through. You really have to be a motivating force for her, if you are living close by to each other or will be soon once school starts, then try to get her to go outside, the sun can do wonders. Things like taking walks through town/the park. Help her out when you can when she's going through a heavy episode because depression WRECKS your motivation to do ANYTHING except lie in your bed and watch TV. 

Again, you really do have to be there for her for the sake of being there for her. If someone simply giving me a smile or saying hi to me in the hall can make my day imagine what it would be for her if you just hang out with her. I'm not entirely sure why she'll go from being just depressed during the day to turning irritable at evening. I usually am at my worst when its at night and I'm alone in my bed so it might be that but I don't know, everyone is different. If she's always thinking more clearly the next day maybe its because she just gets so worn down from the day to the point that night comes she just snaps and then she sleeps, recharges, clears her head and the cycle continues the next day but again, I don't know.


BTW depressed people hate hearing about why they never seem motivated, how they can be depressed when they seem so happy, just google ""what depressed people hate to hear"" — in fact google a lot of things about depression, a lot. The better informed you are, the better the chances are that you can help her. Some sites I think are good are the YT channel [TheMighty](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKQaSdgFK01UyVdv6-Up1mg), I would pay attention to their playlists on depression and anxiety along with some of the ones in mental health that seem applicable, of course on /r/depression there are the [talking tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/igh87/concerned_but_dont_know_what_to_say_here_are_some/) and [risk assessment guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/1c7nqf/worried_about_someone_who_may_be_suicidal_heres/). Additionally, most online sources mostly say the same things depending on what you look up because you won't find anyone that doesn't have depression saying BS stuff about depression because they have better(or worse) things to do than that. The exception is if you actively search them out. Some things I would google, are:

•""What to say to someone with depression"" — and what not to say!

•""How to help someone with depression""

•""Symptoms of depression""

•General YT videos/short films about depression give a pretty good idea

•Just read through what people post/comment about on /r/depression but be warned, it's... depressing

•[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6lz62i/please_help_me_help_my_boyfriend/) is a post of someone going through a similar situation as you with her bf that some people including me replied to 


Finally, I can't say how grateful I am that you actively oppose the stigma around depression, you have no idea how hard it is not being able to tell my closest friends about mine because they are apart of this stigma. However, chances are that you are more opposed to it than she is. I don't know her but I know that many people with depression feel ashamed of it because of said stigma and believe it themselves. You should learn to be able to talk about depression and anxiety without having to resort to euphemisms such as being just ""sad"" or going through an ""episode"". I'm not saying don't use these words, just be context minded. Best of luck to both of you fellow internet friend 

P.S. Medical help with a psychiatrist and/or a therapist is the best thing that can help her. I'm going to assume the money problem won't be an issue since she can use her parents' money. Therapy is the best thing for her and it doesn't matter how much work you put into helping her, it is very rare anyone ever just ""snaps out"" of depression without a trained professional. Therapy sessions are the best thing to start with so I would heavily encourage you to encourage her and her parents to get her help.

It's amazing to me how consistent they are in the type and quality of music they put out.

First impressions as follows:

* **The Eve:** this song is the thicc slow jam we all knew EXO had in them. **5/5**

* **Ko Ko Bop:** fan theory that this was about drugs confirmed? lol I'm kidding song-wise, but the mv seemed a bit heavy handed to me in that respect. Anyhow, I love this song because it's catchy but lower key, like Lucky One meets Cherry Bomb or something.  The bridge in this song almost killed me. (Side note: the 'Shimmy Shimmy Kokobop' in the intro instantly reminded me of Country Grammar.) **5/5**

* **What U do?:** quintessential feel good summer jam. **5/5**

* **Forever:** I think I listened to the teaser too many times and had such a specific expectation of this song that I can't fully enjoy the final result yet. The different chord progression in the first half of the chorus is tripping me up. I'm *living* for Chanyeol's rap verse tho. **4/5** with room for growth

* **Diamond:** I feel like the instrumentation at the start thinned out in this song just as I wanted it to get thicker. I've been listening to EXO's full discography over the last few weeks and can say with confidence that this song is one of the weirder things they've put out (but not the weirdest. That's still Wolf. But it's in the family with Two Moons and Cloud 9). **3.5/5**

* **Touch it:** groovy and wonderful. It's like a mellower version of Love Me Right. I think the push and pull of this song was done just right. It feels so well balanced. And vocals are on point. **5/5**

* **Chill:** I quite like the isolated music box sound, video game effect noises, and bouncy synths used in the background. This song feels very intentionally trance-y/disorienting to me. It's weird but I love it. **4.5/5**

* **Walk On Memories:** I love the piano and whole mid-tempo baby making music thing going on here. The only think kinda irksome is the hook but I'm sure I'll get used to it. Everything after the key change was pretty. **4/5**

* **Going Crazy:** instant favorite. The bass and instrumentation, I just can't. I'm rendered without words to describe why I like this but they damn sure saved the best for last. **10/5**


**The Eve** and **Going Crazy** are huge standouts to me. In my experience, EXO albums get better with each listen so I look forward to that, considering that I liked this much better on first listen than I did for Ex'act (and now I thoroughly enjoy Ex'act from start to finish).

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/ed7e2cad97d2426aae804996a25bbe4f.png)  

&gt; Elmer Gantry's Velvet Opera picked up on the British psychedelic movement after supporting The Pink Floyd as a soul/blues band called 'The Five Proud Walkers', the lineup was Richard Hudson (Hud) on drums, Colin Forster on lead guitar, Jimmy Horrocks (Horovitz) on organ and flute, John ???? (bass) and Dave Terry on vocals and harmonica. The boys took inspiration from the experience and it wasn't long before the change of both music and image. They gigged for a while playing blues based material,but gradually got interested in more free-form stuff. John ???? was replaced by John Ford and the band searched for a new name. Velvet Opera was chosen initially, which was amended to Elmer Gantry's Velvet Opera within days after Dave turned up to a session wearing a long black cape and a preachers hat and had to endure some piss-taking from the rest of the band (Elmer Gantry was the fictional hero of a Sinclair Lewis novel and 1960 film about a preacher). The name stuck and Dave became Elmer. By this time Elmer, influenced by the music of John Cage, was making experimental taped backing sounds and using signal generators on stage in the act. The band began to get quite a following and played clubs and university gigs all over the country and at London venues like the Marquee and 100 club and Electric garden. They would also occasionally play at the Speakeasy where Jimi Hendrix would jam with them, also people like Jeff beck and Eric Burdon. The band had been recorded independantly for a while by Southern Music Publishing, who had their own, four -track, studio in Denmark Street, and it wasn't long before they had secured a record deal with CBS's ""Direction"" label. The problem was that Southern Music had originally signed them as a bluesy/jazzy band and they were not very keen on trying to get new, more riotous stage act on disc.
The group were persuaded to do more ""regular"" material. The first recording was the song, written by Elmer, that the band were best known for, 'Flames'. The record was on jukeboxes all over the country and was covered live by bands as diverse as ""The Joe Loss Orchestra"" and ""Led Zeppelin"", in fact Jimmy Page recently told Elmer that Flames was the only non-Zep number that they included in their early stage-act (Robert Plant also included it in his 2001-2002 tour). However, for the average radio listener the song was too far ahead of its time and despite live popularity and numerous radio plays the song only managed to achieve number 30 in the charts. Direction did however, take faith in the band to record second and third singles and more importantly a self-titled album. The group's second single, ""Mary Jane"" was taken off the BBC playlist after they realised that the song was the slang term for Marijuana. The third single, Volcano, was written by Howard &amp; Blakely, who had written hits for Dave Dee etc. After three singles and the album, major success had still not been achieved. The agent at the time, Terry King, had booked the group a lot of shows, they were regularly appearing on the BBC on John Peel's show, among others, they were playing, touring and promoting hard, but recording success was still elusive. Colin Forster was then replaced by Paul Brett but this still didn't acheive the desired result. Disagreements erupted within the band, which lead to a split from Elmer and so the Velvet Opera was formed. Elmer Gantry remembers : ""eventually, EGVO broke up due to a change of direction within the band. Paul Brett, (who incidentally I had worked with previously and had brought into the band following our initial success) although a brilliant guitarist, had a strong interest in more folkish music and, with Hud's increasing interest in playing instruments other than drums, the band started to change direction. I did not welcome this change, and whilst I had great admiration for all the other members as musicians, was not interested. There followed a coup in which the other members of the band attempted to just replace me and keep the name. This would clearly have been ridiculous as I was already known as Elmer Gantry and the band was largely know for its riotous, envelope-pushing stage presence, not for electro-folk. The result was that they brought twelve string guitarist folk-blues guitarist Johnny Joyce in, and continued as The Velvet Opera and eventually The Strawbs and The Monks producing the novelty hits ""Union Man"" and ""Nice legs, shame about the face"" and I continued with a new line-up, formed from the Downliners sect, as the Elmer Gantry band. I also later had a lead role in ""Hair"" in the west end, recorded on two Alan Parsons Project albums, did the lead vocals on Cozy powell's album, sang and wrote with Jon Lord on his solo album.
A second album, ""Ride a Hustler's Dream"" was released by the Velvet Opera on their own, Elmer and Colin having been replaced by John Joyce and Paul Brett. The album was recorded (as was the EGVO album) at Southern Music's studios in Denmark St. Paul Brett remembers : ""It was an 8 track set up and was a real struggle to get real quality and instrument separation, but we did our best. We did lots of Radio 1 sessions and quite a few dates, the most memorable being with the Who at The Lyceum. John Ford and Richard Hudson were getting more into writing their own songs and they also wanted to perform them, Johnny and I were more into acoustic music and inevitably, we went our own ways quite amicably. Southern would have made another LP with us but we felt we needed to follow our hearts! I spoke to Hud last year about the possibility of collaborating on a new Velvet Opera LP as the bands reputation has survived and even grown over the years, probably because we have all done our own things. This is very much a possibility and I will pursue this with Hud and John. I did a CD last year with John Joyce 'Acoustic Power' that was really well received by the media. It could also be that there is another Fire LP in the future and certainly their will be more Paul Brett CD's and there are collectors issues on CD of the previous material and some unreleased Paul Brett &amp; Sage stuff via my site www.fret-dancer.com"". After the split, Ford and Hudson joined The Strawbs whilst Rick Wakeman was still a member. In 1971, Colin Forster recruited a whole new Velvet Opera featuring ex-Tintern Abbey vocalist, Dave MacTavish, bass player Colin Bass and drummer Mike Fincher who recorded one single on the Spark label. Elmer Gantry later appeared in the Seventies in Stretch singing the hit single ""Why Did You Do It?"" Stretch released four albums and some singles on the ""Anchor"" label. During the 90s, a CD of live ""John Peel BBC Sessions"" was released by ""Strange Fruit""  and a double CD set "" Stretch, The Story of Elmer Gantry"" was released on Repertoire Records. The Stretch catalogue is currently handled by ""Trojan Records.""  Elmer is now working in the drug-rehabilitation field but still gigs occasionally both here and in America. Read more on Last.fm.

Honestly, I liked 6v6 for the fact that Raid was a 6 member thing so it was good that no one was excluded if you went to go play some pvp after or if you were making a massive play, it felt rewarding to get like a 5/6 guardian wipe but at the same time 6v6 felt extremely chaotic on specific maps and in general, I felt it conflicted with the flow of the game and with the whole ability spam consistently pushing you back so I'm very open and interested in how 4v4 plays out.

One of my concerns is the pace of the game since Trials currently is extremely slow paced so do you think an extra person on both teams will open up the game? Was 4v4 fast paced in Halo? 

Ah makes sense, I have been with playstation all my life but I assure you, I'm not one of them people who starts stupid arguments over consoles. I think they're both great and personally feel bad about the exclusivity we have.

t5_2szp0,,,,1500244426,,,,,,,TrueFilm,,,,,,dkaw5hm,,,0,,,,whitemonochrome,False,,t3_6nnaa4,7,,,,,,"I caught a little bit of a Marguerite Duras bug this week. I watched:  
**Césarée (1978)  
Les mains négatives (1978)  
Aurélia Steiner (Melbourne) (1979)  
Aurélia Steiner (Vancouver) (1979)  
La Femme du Gange (1974)  
Il dialogo di Roma (1983)**     
and revisited:  
**Baxter, Vera Baxter (1977)  
Agatha and the Limitless Readings (1981)**
  
For anyone who doesn’t know, Marguerite Duras is a French author turned screenwriter turned director. She most famously wrote Hiroshima mon amour (1959). Her work is very unorthodox, poetic, and abstract, and tends to move at a glacial pace. Kind of like the words of Hiroshima mon amour over top the images of a Chantal Akerman film.  
  
A while ago in a recommendation thread, I mentioned one of Duras’ earlier films **Destroy, She Said (1969)** which is basically her version of Last Year at Marienbad. At the time, that was the only Duras film I’d seen, but since then I’ve worked through most of her filmography and she has emerged as one of my favorite writer/directors.  
 ----------  
 
  
A little about the films I saw this week:  
- The films from 1978-79 are all short films between 10 - 50 minutes and are wonderful as a 100-minute block of experimental short stories. Duras and her melancholic voice narrate the four films as we meander through a different location in each (circling around a courtyard, driving through the streets at dawn, moving down a river, resting at a beach in black and white). All four are softly meditative. Les mains négatives is maybe my favorite of the four for how perfectly the relationship of Duras’ story of an ancient cave painting and a painful desire for connection work alongside the images of an empty city and its somber score.   
- Le Femme du Gange is like an updated version of Destroy, She Said with two of the main actresses returning and the same confused sense of reality pervading every character. It’s not my favorite, but I’ll admit I had some trouble following the film.  
- Il dialogo di Roma is very similar to the first four short films but pushes the glacial pace to a rate that was a bit too challenging even for me.  
- If all this experimental, poetic narration with no characters doesn’t sound all that appealing Baxter, Vera Baxter might be the better place to start. The film has a magical essence most notably created by its rhythmic score (which literally never stops). The film treats Vera Baxter almost like a mythical character, but Duras writes her as just a regular woman. It’s ultimately a film about a woman who is (for whatever reasons you come up with) in a marriage that she doesn’t seem that interested to be a part of or to leave. It’s both melancholic and somehow joyous to watch.   
- Agatha and the Limitless Readings is another heavily experimental film from Duras. So far from what I’ve seen, it is the pinnacle of her experimental work. Empty villas, empty streets, open windows looking out to the sea, the occasional character leaning against the wall or lying on the couch, the occasional deliberate camera in the mirror, Duras’ voice telling the maybe true maybe false story of a brother and sister tangled in feelings for one another. The film is her most meditative and perhaps her most touching drama as well.  
 ----------  
 
So if you’re into slow melancholic French narration and slow melancholic photography and don’t mind being a little lost at times, then Duras is pretty awesome.  
  
I’ve found most of her work on YouTube typically in very suspect quality, but I put together a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEmU9twNWOVJFGU5uXWZapRwrkINOCXp6) if anyone is interested.

Also: **India Song (1975)** and **L’homme atlantique (1981)** are two films I didn’t watch this week but are great Duras films I recommend.

Of course it isn't his responsibility to teach her, and expecting his whole family to switch to her language doesn't sound very reasonable (especially not after four years), but most people I know get so excited about their partners learning their language! 


My boyfriend and I will take around 30 minutes every day to practice his Portuguese together and it's honestly a fucking blast. I get so proud of him whenever he reaches a new milestone, and I get to enjoy his cute heavy accent and teach him fun dirty words and expressions. I never pushed for him to learn it and he's been doing it mostly on his own through apps like Duolingo, but you bet your ass I match his enthusiasm in any way that I can. Making him lists of day to day phrases or slang, Brazilian songs playlists, watching Brazilian movies together, coming up with our own little inside jokes in Portuguese, coaching him through little pretend conversations for when he meets my parents in December etc, etc. None of it requires that much effort, at all! 


It's just so confusing to me... why the hell would he ever REFUSE to speak to her in Spanish? Does he not want her to communicate with his family? Does he not want her to a be a part of it? Or is it that she's really lukewarm about it and he's picking up on that fact?   ",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6nllkg,,,,,,,,,,,1500221568.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1501294003.0,,,

What's interesting is that I heard that other phones had screens mounted upside-down and nobody ever mentioned that or noticed such issue.

However I have one question but it is a bit more generalized. What really bothers me is why most phone manufacturers stopped putting FM radio to the phones. I get the idea that they want to push people to using Spotify/Google music/Apple music etc. but for me the radio is a very important thing. First - I listen to a lot of radio when I ride a bike, I just find it more enjoyable than just some Spotify playlist. Second - if there ever happens to be some natural disaster/war or pretty much anything apocalyptic or whatever, often the first thing that may go wrong(mostly due to natural disaster) is that services go down and the only way to hear what's going on and what the authorities might advise to do is over the radio. How am I supposed to do that if my super modern, advanced and futuristic phone doesn't have a simple radio tuner?",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6njyvc,,,,,,,,,,,1500187180.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1501286818.0,,,
t5_2t8uj,,,,1500142329,,,,,,,WorldOfWarships,,,,,,dk9fnyo,,,0,,,,Cyborg_Chris,False,,t3_6nha9a,1,,,,,,"Well, let me say this first: 

If you are mostly playing co-op and you are just getting a t8 ship, then stop playing co-op and play more ransoms. T8 is when you start seeing t10 ships that can fuck up your day, and seeing as you have rarely played ransoms as much, you might not even know a) your ship line or how to play it properly and b) how to properly angle, shoot, etc. 

I recommend you first watch an entire playlist on youtubers such as iChase, Notser, Flamu since your basically going into ransoms with your head sticking out of the windows, and, as a player who has been like that before, don't want the same to happen to you. Get comfortable with the line, know the strengths and weaknesses, and then choose whatever ship you want to play.

Also ship performance  depends on how you play the ship to its strengths and how well can you compensate for the weaknesses.

If you like being aggressive and pushing up, then the Bismarck is good for you, just watch for the inconsistent guns which will be a pain a lot of times, though fantastic armor, secondaries and hydro will make up for that.

If yo like playing more patient and instead a more supportive/defensive role, Amagi is the choice for you. She has the most amount of guns at t8, has good accuracy, and an amazing torpedo belt plus nice concealment. She has a weak belt, but also has turtle back and sits low on the water, so angling mitigates that much. She, like the Bismarck, is alright in terms of AA, but not fantastic like NC. The Amagi plays at between 16-10km, while the Bismarck plays well at distances between 13km-anything close than that. 

Overall I've played both and I enjoy both. They each have a unique style, and if played correctly, can do decent in t10 games, but you have to be much more cautious and don't push as much in t10; don't take as much risks like you can at t8.

I tend to get a little crazy though [Ticket the other month for 65 in 40mph zone] - so I'll take these down a notch.

There's a mix of nerve tips, as well as just general driving rules. You'll be fine :)

1. Enjoy the ride, don't stress,  stay in the far right lane and just chill at the speed limit (left lane is for passing i.e. faster cars!)
2. Cruise control - total life saver, helps on the feet and hips
3. Sounds and Snacks - Get audio books, or a long jammin playlist, also easy to eat snacks (you'll be driving, so want something that's easy to eat on the go) - sandwiches, fruit, chips etc..
4. Always signal, any turn or lane change - Communicate. 
5. Wait 3 seconds after the green light (if you are first in line) - cars can speed through the intersection, or if you don't want to, atleast look both ways. 
6. Sit atleast a full car length behind another car at a stop light
7. on the highway stay 
8. ALWAYS look over your shoulder to your blind spot when changing lanes
9. Depending on weather conditions, never be less than 3-6 seconds behind a car
10. If you are in the left lanes, move over for faster traffic
11. When you turn left, or do a U-Turn, or turn out onto a road, ALWAYS turn into the first lane - don't go out to other lanes
12. Don't push yourself too hard, if you have to stop, stop, especially if you get drowsy
13. Always monitor your mirrors, consistently know where cars are, be prepared for them to turn into your lane, know when you are in someone's blind spot
14. mirrors mirrors mirrors
15. Always look out to whats in front of you, look ""15 seconds"" ahead as others have said. 
16. If you feel like speeding ;) Never go more than 10% over the speed limit if you want to play it safe. Or even safer 5 over. I usually do 5 on main roads, and 10 on interstates/highways. 

Good luck and have fun! :)",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6n20yg,,,,,,,,,,,1500109937.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1501264351.0,,,

i don't have money for any of this yet, but yeah i'm building myself custom speaker and buying headphones not now, but in a couple years i just want to know what my goals in life are.

i focus my life around being a basshead. not all my music is bassy, but now that i have my he400i i can actually listen to my music (cable broke bought one) since like the athm50 can't do bass even at ridiculous high volume. my music taste in one playlist : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE_LcoYPmjja4ipzTkaR2Y1TwxUkr-u_l",,,,,,False,,True,,,,,False,,True,t3_6n7slz,,,,,,,,,,,1500026848.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1501235405.0,,,
t5_2sa4x,,,,False,,,,,,,edmproduction,,,,,,dk7dq8m,,,0,,,,alexcowles,False,,t3_6n33q8,3,,,,,,"I suggest the following few techniques which I had, for so long ignored, but in the last year or so have been adhering to in a (potentially futile) attempt to make sure that what I release is the absolute best it can be, and not merely “good enough”.

**Listen to your work in context.**

Take your mixdown or rough master and put it in a playlist or a mixtape alongside tracks that you respect. How does it stand up against your benchmarks?

How does it feel when your track drops in? Does the energy start to drag? Is there a noticeable dip in production quality? Do you think people would notice your track amidst the rest?

**Give it some time.**

I love this one. When I finish a track, I’ll stick it in a folder on my computer where I’ll leave it overnight.

In the morning I’ll get up and give it another listen. If it still sounds good, I’ll let it sit some more. Even just a night’s sleep can unearth some odd things you might want to fix.

A week later I’ll go back and listen again, if it’s still good - it gets left longer.

A month later, I’ll give it a listen. If I can still say after a month that I enjoy listening to it, and that it sounds great - then I’ll consider it release-worthy (at least in my eyes).

If you can still stand a track you’ve made a month or two down the line - that’s a good sign. The time away from the track should provide you with enough context to listen to it more subjectively when you do return to it.

Artists often get frustrated with music they’ve released too quickly and if you want to be able to continue to support your own music, perform it at shows, play it the radio and deal with people discovering your older stuff in 3, 5 or 10 years time - you have to be able to enthuse about all of the tracks you put out there.

**Think about sending it to your musical heroes.**

Assume, for a moment that you had the direct email address of your top 5 musical heroes. You knew that if you sent them this track to check, they’d definitely listen. Is it ready to go?

How do you feel about it now? Is it ready for them to check it out, or will you caveat the email with “well, it’s still in progress, so let me know where I can improve!”? How quickly will you regret sending them this track over another that you like more?

**Get your mates round.**

Have you got a few friends who enjoy similar music to you? Invite them round and play your tracks for them. Watch and listen to their reactions.

How do you feel as you press that play button? Do you get embarrassed? Do you mutter things like “well, I don’t know if it’s quite finished yet” or “I might actually look at sorting the drums here”? Do you get a bit of a pre-emptive cringe before the intro has finished? All good signs that when pushed, you feel like the tracks not good enough.

These sort of reactions might not surface when you’re alone, but having a small audience who are not afraid to tell you what they think will help.

**Consult the internet.**

As much as I feel like asking too wide an audience will always give you people who like something, and that the faceless nature of the internet means anybody will say anything to appease someone (or the opposite!), I’d suggest as a possible last resort turning to the internet for assistance.

Websites like [Fluence](https://fluence.io/) or [Audiokite](http://www.audiokite.com/) can help you determine the viability of a track by getting feedback. Fluence, from a single tastemaker or person of interest, and Audiokite, from a larger crowd of perhaps less relevant people.

This sort of thing could get you some interesting results, since many people will feel there’s no relationship or friendship at stake, and to give you honest, perhaps even brutal feedback is no big deal.

Honesty from your listener/s in this area is crucial, but you will also get those who likely gloss over how much you have emotionally invested in your own success, and respond with what they think you want to hear. This is the downside.

The bottom line here is that before you go sending music to labels, or starting your own imprint in order to self-release, stop and take some time out.

Consider your tracks. Try to set aside how excited you may be about your own work at the moment, and listen to them objectively. Try the exercises above, and see how you get on.",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6n33q8,,,,,,,,,,,1500020581.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1501234311.0,,,

I like the player character having Armor Abilities, and Spartan Movement as well. I just do, and feel that as long as the maps are designed around the player having said abilities so that the gameplay is balanced. Then it can still be a great game. 

While you feel that such a change pushes the game to far away from what you like about Halo. I am glad you are open minded, but you don't like Halo Reach, 4, or 5 for these reasons. 

If it's any consolation I despise Halo 4's multiplayer. I dislike it for having perks, Killstreak/Ordinances, lack of powerweapon control due to killstreaks, weapon feel, maps (Maybe a couple I liked), worthless armor abilities, not being able to pick grenades up off a dead foe without a fucking perk, gunfeel, and I am sure a bunch of other reasons that aren't coming to mind at the moment. I do like the Mantis though. The Mantis is awesome. (also loved the campaign, but we are talking about MP)

EDIT: my personal solution to compromising with both player bases for the game is to include a classic Halo playlist without spartan movement and classic maps designed for halo gameplay without it. Maybe add that option to custom games as well. But I am wary of splintering the fanbase the way Halo Reach's multiple playlists did (Vanilla, TU, and Anniversary).

Do not blame your teammates for sucking it happens there is nothing you can do. You biggest skill is adaption. You need to in every game adapt and fill the roll that is needed based on your teammates play styles. You will get the occasional games where everyone is rotating and such and you can trust your teammates. However usually one area is left to be filled by you. So fill that role play that roll and over time you will climb.

I got to Plat 1 Div 3 a month or 2 ago and fuck did I drop I think I dropped to Gold 2 or Gold 3 Div 1 in the course of a few hours. It was brutal. Stop playing when this happens or try a different playlist or even rock casual for a bit. Once I learned to try and fill whatever roll was needed that is when I pushed from Gold 3/Plat 1 to Plat 2 in the course of a few hours. It felt so good.

Lastly play games! I hear a lot of people saying it but for me anyway it rings true. You have to put in the hours and grind. I sometimes would play a few ranked matches and switch to play casual so it felt far worse when I broke even from 10 games or went in the negative. I played for a few hours of ranked maybe 30+ games this time and I came out in the positive. 

Lastly Lastly no matter how frustrated you get just keep it to yourself.  It is better for you and your teammates. I know myself when I have toxic teammates I tend to start playing as bad as they think I am. If I am getting tilted by easy misses and saves WHO CARES! I have been there many times I am not perfect maybe they are having a hard day. 

Keep positive do some warm up games before heading into ranked. Quit if you feel like you are not playing 100% for a bit. Forgive teammates. Grind. Fill in the needed role. Observe your teammates and I am sure you will start getting the hang of things.

Do intervals like 2 minutes at normal pace, then 1 minute at a faster pace throughout the workout.  This keeps you watching the clock, and hopefully pushing yourself so that you are focusing on breathing.  It makes the time go by so much faster.

And Dice needs to fix their mistake and start giving away the DLC's for cheap prices and give tonnes of trials for them.

Finish your tiamat into a titanic 3rd/4th. Consider a sterakks gauge if they have a lot of mixed damage or true damage.

2. No, counter jungling doesn't do any good if your lanes are dying to ganks. Voli has a strong early dueling potential. Pick fights with someone who can't run, or the enemy jungler when he is taking camps.

3. Put down wards and try to mirror the enemy jungler. Start at a different camp or take a weird route to confuse them. SWEEP YOUR CAMPS.

4.  Flank or split push with your tiamat and ulti. No one wants to fight you alone. You're a BEAR.

5.  Ping your gank in advance and urge your laner to take a trade to bait the mobility skills. Gank while they are on cooldown.

My stock head unit does fine with my iPhone, bluetooth takes about two and a half minutes or so to register when you first start up, and of course it adds insult to injury by displaying the ""device not found"" warning during that time. You can use steering wheel controls to skip tracks and control volume, but changing playlists and input (I switch from music to audiobooks on my phone) are best left to choosing on the phone itself. I don't think that the head unit supports Siri, and I haven't tried holding down the phone button to engage it and see if voice commands even work. A bit old-school, I am. The usb connection is great, with folders of music on a stick the head unit will allow you to choose folders and tracks and it all works reasonably well. But I'm still going to turf it when I hear of the definitive ""works with backup camera, steering wheel controls, and full iPhone"" capable unit.

I'll be doing the same thing I did last episode, that is, writing down what songs from the OST appear, as well as when and in what situations. This is mostly for my own curiosity (I want to remember the scenes used in most OSTs when they come up in my playlist) but I figure other people might be interested so I'm posting it here as well. Again, romanized and translated song names are courtesy of the [love live wikia](http://love-live.wikia.com/wiki/Notes_of_School_idol_days)!

This episode also includes the first washiwashi of the anime (courtesy of Maki snooping around), and [a certain fanservice shot](http://i.imgur.com/U01VHl2.jpg) I can't believe I didn't notice the first time I watched it.  
I also expect a lot of people in this thread to go around declaring Maki their best girl... If you're a first time watcher, hold your horses. (If you're not, [This subreddit's](https://www.reddit.com/r/onetrueidol/) for you) I changed my mind over who was Best Girl about 7 times throughout both seasons of the anime and I reached the conclusion there's no real Best Girl.

Coffee definitely helps, making sure that you're all packed and prepped for the next day, having a killer workout playlist in the morning and also SLEEP.

Camille is a weak laner, unlike Riven and Fiora. Farming is going to be really important so you can get your Triforce and Hydra item as quick as possible. Top lane meta right now is mostly fighters/bruisers, which are going to be better than you in laning phase, so you just need to farm and outscale them. Your farm is a little low, which is kind of hypocritical of me to say because mine is too, so try to learn wave manipulation from people like SoloRenektonOnly. Here's a playlist you should watch (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQz3yU5tzJ0&amp;list=PLzHaU28zdQ4GAMfVf_aASyiB4dheLsONx). Also, make sure to let your team know what your plan is; if you think you would be more useful split pushing, consider getting RHydra and let your team know that they should keep lanes pushed, but not teamfight.

t5_3fey5,,,,False,,,,,,,raisedbynarcississts,,,,,,dk2810k,,,0,,,,QuitePossiblyRBN,False,,t1_dk22hxu,2,,,,,,"I definitely get what you're feeling right now. I almost feel like I'm talking to myself from 10 years in the future! So I guess I'll tell you some things I might tell my 15/16 year old self.

1. Talk to your counselor about the extent of your privacy and his/her ideas about confidentiality. I'm so glad you've been talking to a counselor, but until you're completely comfortable knowing what info he will/will not share with your parents you're not going to relax enough to truly get things off your chest in a way that's going to give you relief from what you're feeling. When you're at school there's a legal concept called ""in loco parentis"" that basically gives your teachers and counselors guardianship over you in lieu of your parents being there. What it does is give the adults at your school a responsibility to protect you from harm. Counselors as a rule take student confidentiality very seriously and have a general code of ethics, however when that collides with their in loco parentis responsibilities this can lead them to an ethical grey area. If your counselor is experienced he or she will be able to explain their stance on student confidentiality to you clearly. (Take whatever they say over my understanding of things as they are the pro and I am going off a little internet digging.)

2. Your parents may not respond to your depression in a way that you anticipate. When I was your age I often thought to myself, ""if they only knew what I was going through they would help me or do X."" Often times they ended up doing the exact least helpful thing in response to my feelings when they found out which only made me feel worse. I don't know exactly what your parents are like, but from what you've said about their physical abuse and attempting to destroy your things and relationships, it doesn't sound like they hold your feelings in high regard. That doesn't mean that other people don't value your feelings, however. Start looking to other people for that kind of validation and acceptance. Turn to your friends and other trusted adults if you can and seek comfort with them. Eventually, yes, your parents going to give you your phone back and they're going to start lifting those restrictions, but they're probably going to do it when they see fit and not based on how you feel. 

3. I can't stress enough how much better is feels NOT to self harm when you're feeling down. Here are some things you can do to both occupy that time and get your feelings out. You can draw, no matter what your skill level is at. Even if you wanna just scribble and stab your pen into a sketch pad for a while. It gets that frantic energy out and drawing can be very therapeutic. If you're not big on drawing you can always write. Sometimes I'll just journal my random thoughts into a notepad. Sometimes I write poetry or sometimes letters to people in my life. Exercise is also a good alternative. I used to self harm when I had a lot of adrenaline going on inside. Doing some push ups and sit ups in my room for a while would tucker me right out and I'd be calm again and ready to settle down with a book or take a nap. Music! Hoo boy was I ever into making mix tapes for every mood and fancy when I was your age. I still do it with playlists on my Spotify. I have one for every ex (and my current) boyfriend, every best friend, bad moods, good moods, dancing, chilling out... you name it. There's something especially freeing about finding that one song that describes how you're feeling perfectly. Start trying to be kind to yourself when you're in conflict. Your problems won't go away, but you'll be better equipped to handle what life throws at you and roll with the punches so to speak. In the end, you are always deserving of care and love, no matter what signals your parents may be giving you. 

I was going to write more but jeez I just looked at the time and I have work in the morning! I hope something here is helpful for you. Remember that you CAN get through this. There is SO MUCH good on the other side. Please believe me when I say that things DO get better from here. Your heart may be breaking now but it will mend given time and proper care. Take it from someone who's had their heart broken quite a bit! Take care of yourself!",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6m4kp7,,,,,,,,,,,1499752165.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1501140561.0,,,

If they're showing up at your base by the time you get a scout unit out; you need to be scouting much earlier. I would recommend to build a scout unit the moment the game starts. Use this unit to collect resources that are further away from your base then head over to their base around the 1:30 - 2:00 minute mark. Don't forget to scout mini bases as well. Additionally, use this scout unit to see where the opponent's forces are.. if you see two armies of Enforcers pushing the right side of the map; ensure you have ample troops there to defend. 

Another thing. A lot of these early game pushes (Enforcers, Flamers) cost a lot of resources to execute. So, if you manage to hold them off; take map control and prevent them from expanding. You'll now have the advantage. 

You said you used Hellbringers, so I'll assume you play UNSC. When it comes to countering rushes, Jackrabbits might be a better choice. A decent number of them will roll an army of infantry. One ungraded turret is also a good idea. 

I hope this helps out a little bit. If you have anymore questions, add me, and I'll try to help you out. We can play a couple games, so I can better visualize what's going on. GT: sad joker95. 

I've made it Champion in all playlists, excluding blitz (working on blitz currently), so hopefully I'll be able to share some knowledge with you.

Halo 5 would be infinitely better with smaller maps and no sprint, that's the main thing that really drives me nuts in Halo 5 and makes it feel so not Halo. Performance i'm sure will be fine on the Xbox One X so not too worried about that side of things. 

They gotta really go hard and get it right this time tho, cuz while Halo is still struggling with it's identity 15 years into its life, other games are just taking more population away from it the playlists, CoD is going back to boots on the ground and considering franchising their esport, it's gonna be hard keeping people on Halo while pushing away old players and new players maybe seeing more success and fun with so many other options.

In terms of Wave I am currently just a fan mostly. I follow this sub and know of some of the bigger players in the community. I follow a bunch of up and comers on SC as well and do my best to promote them. 

One thing I'd like to start doing personally is curating more YT mixes exposing the artists I find on SC. I do not run ads on my YT mixes and they are purely designed to get artists views. I tried my hand at a few but I am realizing people on YT already know a lot of the 'bigger' songs so I think an avenue is there for taking the SC songs and putting them in mixes. 

In terms of my own music, I go by Leafygreens and I have been working on an EP with elements of Wave but I wouldnt necessarily call it Wave music alone; I just so happen to be using elements found in Wave when I found this sub and you guys. Right now my music has taken a hard left turn with popularity growing in a non wave track I had done. 

Overall, I just want to help promote producers because I am one myself. Right now the best idea I have is making mixes and trying to build a sub for beat makers/producers exclusively (think r/listentothis but just for beats or producers projects). 

If anyone has some submissions for wave style music I need to make a new mix soon! message me here or on my twitter @chillstro_music on twitter. ",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6meqi4,,,,,,,,,,,1499710872.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1501124809.0,,,
t5_30cz1,,,,False,,,,,,,RocketLeague,,,,,,dk13epf,,,0,,,,ytzi13,False,,t1_dk11f2d,1,,,,,,"Well, your first point is a complicated one. Yes - you don't have to move any fingers to quick chat, which is a valid point, but it takes people time to say a word or sentence and there is a delay on most voice streaming services: PS4 has a significant voice delay and, while not nearly as bad, Discord has one as well. I have made several posts on here (that received next to no support) about the implementation of both a ""quicker chat"" option (bind a single quick chat option to a single button push. ""I got it!"" would be especially useful) as well as auditory notifications for chat, possible customizable to allow different sounds for different messages, so that players will be sure to acknowledge them. Voice chat has the convenience factor to some extent, but a good quick chat system will always be quicker.

And back to your second point, we will just have to disagree. If we were talking about 3v3 then I would be inclined to agree with you, but I just don't see it in 2v2.

The backlash is just based on my personal experience in this game and the lack of advantage that I've seen. I simply don't believe that it is an unequal experience. I wouldn't be opposed to the 2 playlists, but I just don't think it's necessary. One benefit would be the lack of boosting, which would certainly be nice. If they want to bring it, then by all means I would welcome it with open arms. The backlash is simply aimed at what I believe to be an over exaggeration about the unfair nature of teams in 2v2. And then you have to consider that, while the user base is seemingly large enough to split it in this way, it would be even harder to create fair matches at higher levels. It's already a common occurrence that Diamond 3s face off against GCs because the match making system is lenient and there just aren't a lot of players around those levels.

But, to extend my point of view in the fairness of the current 2v2 system, I tend to believe there are a few different types of players at a rank:

1. Primarily Solo Queuers: These players are generally better at adjusting to their teammates. You can also be pretty certain they belong at the rank they are at.

2. Primarily Team Queuers: If these players have this advantage that you're talking about, then they are likely already at a rank higher then they would otherwise be at. It's not like these players join a party and suddenly become better than their current rank. 50% win rate pretty much applies to everyone. And if you are playing in a team and not doing well, then you will probably continue doing poorly that session. It happens all of the time. I experience as many falling sessions in teams as I do climbing sessions.

In retrospect I realize now the machine is aimed at 3/32"" (2.5mm) rods but I was using 1/8"" (3.2mm) 6013 rods.

Plate is about 3/8"" (10mm) thick.
Only top inch of plate was wire brushed clean before I started. Plate was propped at about 45 degrees. Earth clamp was at top left corner and connected to -ve terminal on machine.

I was sometimes stretching one rod to cover full width of plate 8"" (20cm) but other times focused on going slower. The shortest welds are remainders of rods. Did some push left but mostly pull right.

Trying to watch the pool. Welds seemed less proud off the surface towards the end.
Slag mostly lifted off by itself but some bits were chipped off.
I wire brushed the plate for 'after' photo.

I'm 44yo with shaky hands so I start with one hand holding or steadying the rod and the other the stinger before the rod is half done.

I'm interested in examining penetration but haven't tried to do that yet.

Please comment.

Summary of Comments
1. Running too cold (I need to use thinner rods or my bigger welder)
2. Overlap half of puddle in order to stack (I didn't actually have a plan other than welding lines across the plate)
3. Don't try to stretch the rod across the plate
4. Slow down
5. At low amperage (like my practicing) use thinner plate like 1/4"" to see the process at work
6. Practice with some 7018 as well to see how rods weld differently
7. Practice more to achieve consistency
8. Watch these awesome playlists from WeldingTips about stick (and mig)

Nails-on-the-chalkboard with the volume past the max is dumb.  Maybe just don't invite those unliked bands back next year.  People would rather listen to a good youtube music playlist than that.

 * Back when it worked, the automatic sliding door could be opened and closed with the push of a button on the door pillar. Or, it could be opened and closed with the push of a button on the roof console where the driver can easily reach it which I always forgot about. Of course, it doesn't work now, so the automatic sliding door motor is just extra weight and drag to make the door harder to use manually. The other sliding door was never automatic, which has now made it *more* convenient because it's lighter and easier to use.
 * There's actually a trip computer which can tell you stuff like gas mileage, distance until empty, trip time, etc. All those things you really care about when road-tripping in a minivan. I forget how to use it, so it's pretty much permanently set on exterior temperature.
 * There's a drawer under the passenger's front seat. It's not really hidden, but I'm really good at forgetting it's there.
 * There are grocery hooks on the back of the last row of seats, so when you put groceries in back, they won't slide around. This is *awesome*. Every car should have these. The van's rear volume with all the seats in is actually pretty shallow (I'd estimate less than half as deep as the Impreza's trunk) and it's still way too big to hold groceries snugly. So: grocery hooks!
 * Only the front windows roll down. The windows on the sliding doors are fixed, and the rear windows just pivot out a few inches to vent.
 * There's not really a lot to say about it. It's a box on wheels with seats bolted to the floor. The back two rows do come out, giving you a flat surface big enough to carry full-size sheets of plywood or sheetrock. Unfortunately, mine isn't stow-and-go, so the seats actually come *out*. They're easy enough to get out, but then you have to put them somewhere, and they're fucking heavy to lug around.

Impreza:

 * The headlights turn off when you remove the key from the ignition. Thus, I leave them on all the time and never think about them. (This feature applies across all Subarus. I have no idea what happens with push-button start, so god help those people. Also, there's a downside: I *constantly* forget to turn my headlights on, or off, when I change cars.)
 * The trip computer can tell you distance to empty, instantaneous fuel economy, average fuel economy, trip time, or average speed. There is no compass. In a car from 2014!
 * It has aux in, USB and a cigarette lighter outlet in the center console. The USB port provides power and can read from USB thumb drives. It also has an iPod mode that behaves really weirdly (it overrides the iPod's internal controls, and the radio controls aren't up to anything other than jumping through a playlist) and is typically better ignored in favor of the aux port. It doesn't support my Android phone, so I have to play music off of that with aux or bluetooth.
 * Speaking of which, this isn't unusual these days, but bluetooth audio is actually *awesome*. When I got the car, I was assuming it would be one of those meh features I didn't really care about, but it's pretty great. My phone connects when I get in and I can just start playing music, no messing with cords or even getting my phone out of my pocket.
 * The foam spacer over the spare tire and under the trunk floor has cubbies in it you can hide stuff in. (It's entirely possible this wasn't intentional, and they just shaped the spacer like that for weight or something. Who knows.)
 * Mine is a CVT with manual mode and flappy paddles. Normal enough. However, you can use the paddles in auto mode to temporarily override the transmission. It'll stay in whatever ""gear"" you shift it to for a minute or until your speed or revs varies enough, then go back to auto mode. This is great; you can downshift for engine braking or to pass somebody on the highway without messing with the shifter or doing anything to go back to auto mode after.
 * Speaking of the CVT, it's actually great. It's far and away the best automatic transmission I've ever used. (Eat your heart out, /r/cars.) It's smooth, responsive, and makes tiny little adjustments for small changes in throttle position you couldn't match in a manual.
 * *edit:* Aside from the two cupholders in the center console, there are ""bottle"" holders in all four doors (basically a wider spot with a retaining ear at the end of the map pocket). They are really good for bottles. (You would not want to try to put a cup in one, however.)",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6lyuyp,,,,,,,,,'05 Town &amp; Country w/299k miles; '14 Impreza 2.0i sedan,,1499518502.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1501063244.0,,,

Good point. I still don't think the menus it uses represents that game very well.

&gt;Halo 2 had no way to select skulls and by comparison to games today not a lot of customization.

Oh, you misunderstand, by no means am I saying copy paste them. There are a lot of features that Halo MCC has that the old games didn't, therefore the menus could *not* be the exact same. It makes sense to tweak them in order to accomodate those new features. 

&gt;They had to design and setup a new menu to offer all of the options they did.

Hmm... I don't know about this. I think the reason they went with what they did is because it was cheap. A lot of MCC was outsourced. The menus SCREAM, ""Eh, it works, ship it"". It's lazy. This is completely disregarding how buggy they were at launch, and still are to this day.

The Halo menus were iconic in and of themselves. There is a reason ""Halo [X] Menu"" gets millions of accumulative views on youtube. [I've got this in my bookmarks I put on my second monitor every once in awhile.](http://halome.nu/)

&gt;Between playlists, new skulls, better frame rate and graphics and the new audio engine. It isn't feasible to port a decade old game to a new system

Edit: I first started kicking around the idea after seeing [this commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=texnhicfDBs) a couple years ago on a Beta tape I had picked up, and then started looking more into McDonald's and their co-opting of African American culture. Originally I had Mello Yello as the beverage of choice because it's my favourite soda and I like to push the things I love, but I changed it to Sprite because Sprite has also heavily co-opted the African American culture (check out their twitter and look up 'Sprite P.O.U.R.').

Everything in there is real. 365black.com, National Black McDonald's Operators Association &amp; Dr Pepper Hospitality Scholarship, McDonald's Spotify playlist, everything. Really blows my mind that they're so blatantly and hollowly pandering to the African American community.

Anyway, yeah. There's a little insight into the creative process behind writing this piece. If anyone has any questions feel free to ask.

I wait until I'm used to the game and know the maps a bit before I start, but you don't have to. You'll be matched with other people at your level, so if you're playing badly enough to ""make your teammates' game experience miserable,"" it's likely they won't even notice. Real coordination in teams of randoms probably doesn't happen much until at least platinum. Earlier on, I used to run into people with mics who wanted to communicate almost every other game, but now that's fairly uncommon. That's at upper levels like diamond and onyx, I don't know what it was like down lower. 

Timezones would be tricky but not impossible. I've played with European players before and we were able to work around the six-hour time difference. I'm on summer break and only working on the weekends, so if during the week you could play any time after 3pm (your time), I could definitely join you. It's up to you!

Yeah, Overwatch ranked play can be frustrating. I'm only high silver in that so team coordination is not really a thing at this point. That said, I have run into people with mics and gotten a five-stack going before, which was a great time. I would cautiously say that in general, you'll probably see more coordination between team members in Halo than in Overwatch, at least at the low-to-middle level. This is probably because Halo has had an established pro scene for over a decade and still has fans who want to play that kind of Halo. The ranked/social split also helps, but that's not different from Overwatch. I think the amount of ranked playlists and the diversity among them does make a difference, though. You can choose what you want to play, so you'll always get people who want to be there, as opposed to in Overwatch where you could get a king of the hill match and teammates who just want to push a payload.

Overall, I would guess that you'll see slightly higher team coordination in Halo (don't expect much down at bronze, though...I've heard horror stories lol). If you want people to play with, there's always people looking to play somewhere on the internet. Browsing custom games and adding people who play competitive ones (not minigames) might be another good way to find people to play ranked with.",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6lphvh,,,,,,,,,The Helpful Halo Guy,,1499439017.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1501036459.0,,,

**lllllllllllllllllllllll**


&gt;If living means bowing down to the likes of you bastards, I'd rather die with my head held high.

Such badass line in the beginning of the series, looks like we got the idea how and what this ride is going to be like. 

&gt;One day earlier



* 1 day = 300 years

* Oh..man that blonde guy caught me off guard, the way he was moving his hands in the girl's kimono was totally hilarious.

* Poor old man tho, got bullied for no reason. 

* Fuu seems a pretty nice and courageous girl. 

* You are broke, it's written on your face...


* This guy is a total pervert, talking about 1 or 2 fingers to a female stranger. 


&gt; To serve your lord and do his bidding, is that honorable?

&gt; The other men: Of Course it is.

&gt;Even if that lord is an unimportant price of shit.

* I like how they are trying to tell us that both MCs are totally badass


&gt;Do the math, 100 dumplings for all you guys, what's that work out to? 5 dumplings a pop.


* Seriously the guy in red wasn't looking so smart by his looks, but damn he is a fucking genius. Don't judge a book by it's cover.

&gt;Watch your ass or I will try my sword someday. 


* A BDSM reference!?



* You are in middle of your...fingering, pardon me.

* What the hell? He is taking a hot bath in a scenario like this!?




&gt;Oh yeah, so you were in the bathtub with your thing going on?

&gt;No, that was a dream.

* It wasn't a dream, right?

* FeelsBadMan, Fuu seems pretty upset that her tea shop got burned.

* Jin is complementing Mugen. Looks like they have become friends now. FeelsGoodMan



&gt;ANYTHING!? You mean you can have se...

&gt;Not with you baldy! No way!

&gt;I am not bald, I have been on training for 3 years. 100 squats, 100 push ups, 10 KM run, EVERY SINGLE DAY.

* Momo is cute. 

&gt;So what's the deal with your favors?

* I am starting to like Mugen, he doesn't care about formal shit at all. Such a straightforward Character. 

* What the fuck!!! Fuu's Boobs!!? 

* That boob jiggle tho 

**Thoughts on the episode**

Imo, Samurai Champloo has probably the best pilot episode I have ever seen. It doesn't keep the viewers in darkness, almost explains what is going on and does a great job in introducing us to the atmosphere. 

The world building and Characters are really amazing.

The animation in specific is top notch, fluid and fight scenes are directed amazingly.

 The main highlight for me was the action sequences, specifically any fight involving Mugen and his hip-hop breakdance-style fight choreography. These provide the most visually stunning and engaging sequences in the episode and, along with the vinyl record scratch transitions, emphasize the hip-hop influences of the show in a really cool way.

The comedy and dialogues are just great.

The thing I like about it is that how the music is on point even it is hip hop. When I first watched it, I seriously thought that, ""how lame Hip-Hop will sound with Samurai theme"".Now, I apologize for that.

**In case anyone is wondering/don't know, Samurai Champloo is set in an alternate version ofEdo-era(1603 to 1868) Japan**

**The OP** of Samurai Champloo is probably the best Hip Hop song I have ever heard, there isn't a single when I am traveling by car and I don't play the OP.


I like how the writers have shown the strengths of Jin and Mugen showing us how skillful and strong they both are.

I really like every Character in the trio. 
Fuu is so nice and courageous, she doesn't care if it is the governor's son or whoever she treats them equal and nice. 

Mugen on the other hand is a totally broke and badass dude. You can tell the Character of Mugen just by seeing the early execution part in the episode. His fighting skills are really amazing tho, the way he uses break-dance kinda moves while fighting depicts his acrobatic skills. And you can also tell that he is an expert mathematician. I am wondering if Fuu wouldn't have offered him the dumplings, he would have helped her or not.

Jim seems like cool and smart guy but he was taking a hot bath in that fire and it makes him look like a total idiot. Not sure whether he is a nice person or not, he did helped that man on the streets but was it out of pity or he just wanted to beat the crap out of those Samurai because they were disgusting or something like that.


And I liked the cliffhanger a lot. Let's hope they make it out of there successfully

I haven't watched the subbed version so I don't is it good or not. But give the dub version a try you might just like it**

This could be highly objective as many people are leaning towards that idea more. It could take place outside the Fort where theres wildlife there to make the battle between two teams more interesting. However no real buffs would be present and Fog of War could be done away too. Basically a match to see who can capture the opposing team's base with lanes that lead up to the base.

Or they coule use star wars battlefront game modes such as capturing capsules/pods that drop from space, pushing a line( dont remember the playlist name), someone on here said something about a hunting game. That would be awesome, see which team can hunt a specific set of beasts faster given the same array of weapons and utility items so its more abiut coordination and less about who has the bigger and stronger gun. Weapons and utility items can rotate every week or 2.

Basically objective based playlists would be much better for this game. They shouldnt have anything like clash, or straight up who can get more kills, that should be left for games like destiny",,,,,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6le456,,,,,,,,,,,1499280291.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500980356.0,,,

They added a Grifball playlist back in mid-late 2016 randomly, and the maps that are in it were ported from 360 (they weren't remade in MCC... So someone at 343 had to go on the original Halo 3, pick the maps, and port them...), and there are quite a few of them. Not many people heavily ""requested"" this playlist at launch, let alone when MCC's population was dwindling...

Yet when the community actually requests something, at large, they shrug it off... There have been an absolute TON of fun/new/classic Infection maps and mini games (Halo 3, H2:A, and I'd imagine Halo 4 too), created and recreated in MCC, ripe for matchmaking, yet they won't put them in...

So 343 will add a random ass Grifball playlist, incredibly late into MCC's disaster of a launch, porting over a hefty amount of maps from Halo 3 on the Xbox 360, to the Xbox One (I'm assuming that's more work than putting maps made in MCC, into matchmaking), when no one really pushed a request for it...


... but they won't put any of the 100+ remade and original H3 maps 1,000+ H2:A maps, MADE IN MCC, ON MCC, into matchmaking... 

343 please... Social playlists like BTB, Infection and Action Sack ALL could use a refresh of maps and gametypes... No one likes playing Hammer Hill on a failed Lockout remake (Blackout) on H3...

For the ranked and competitive playlists, there are also maps...

Practicing mechanics on both ground and air as well as rotations will get you to platinum. Training packs are the way to fine tune those.

My goals are to hit plat 3 in threes and high gold or plat 1 in all my other playlists. I want to improve as much as possible as fast as possible and I'm doing everything in my power to do so. That means spending every second of non-match time in free play or custom training packs, changing controls to fit more elite mechanics, and playing as much as possible whenever possible. Thanks for asking!

Tips for a silver player.. hmm. Really all I can say is practice. Learn wall control. That's something very important to learn early on. Practice rolling the ball up the wall, jump and hit it off the wall, air roll so that you're parallel with the ground, and hit the ball again. This will get you used to the mechanics of controlling your car on and off the wall. 
Practice rotations. Learn to stay at midfield if your teammate is pushing up or centering. Learn to push up or get in net if your teammate is at midfield.
Lastly, practice aerial training packs over and over and over and over again. Being able to control your car in the air is a massive advantage over most silver players. 
A quick tip: if you haven't been doing it already, as SOON as you hit ""Find Match"" and it stars searching, go into free play or custom training. The few seconds/minutes that you could spend practicing before you find a match really do add up.

t5_2u9wz,,,,False,,,,,,,StarWarsBattlefront,,,,,,djsqbqc,,,0,,,,mecurt78,False,,t3_6lbuev,4,,,,,,"To offer a completely differing viewpoint, I *want* it to feel like a new game, because I *hated* the last.

The only thing that I liked about Battlefront 2015, aside from the obvious sound and graphics design that comes with DICE titles, was that it was Star Wars. Aside from that, I honestly didn't enjoy it. If this had been a regular sci-fi game, with no Stormtroopers or E-11s, then I never would have even purchased the title.

Somehow, even with the extreme lack of content, there would always be several weapons and cards that were broken in how overpowered or underpowered they were. Heroes and villains were the same way. Often times, the broken things would go weeks or even months before DICE finally got off their asses to fix them, despite the fix only involving changing a few numbers in the game's code. The current state of the abandoned 2015 game shows this perfectly. The Bo-Rifle is decent at blaster combat, which it honestly shouldn't be. Its entire purpose is its instant-kill melee attack, so it should be punishing the user for use at range. The EE-4 is devastating at close range as intended, often outdamaging even the CA-87, but it's just... oddly effective at medium and sometimes even medium-long range. Bossk heals with kills, and because he has a targeting rifle and a grenade launcher able to shoot about *twenty* grenades, he can easily out-heal any damage a team deals to him. Honestly I feel that he should heal a larger amount, but only from melee kills and receive no heal from blaster kills. Even some of the maps are broken. Twilight on Hoth is busted in damn near every mode I've played on it. Supremacy, the Rebels don't have a chance of winning unless they manage to push the Empire's second point. Walker Assault, the Rebels basically don't have a chance at blowing up the walkers at all because of their weirdly large health pools, and the only times I've won as them have been due to T-47s. Rebels should *not* have to *rely* on T-47s.

Fighter combat was absolute trash. Every, and I mean *every* engagement went one of two ways. Either one fighter would see another before the other saw them, and they would destroy them before the other knew they were being fired upon, or both fighters would engage each other and just fly in circles indefinitely, because all fighters had the same (or at least highly comparable) maneuverability. Then eventually someone would try to fly away to get a better angle, and they would inevitably get shot down by the other fighter.

In fact, I'd even say that the fighter *mechanics* in general are trash. Every time I hop into a fighter, I might get one or two kills out of a strafing run before I'm instantly locked onto by 1-2 Ion Torpedoes. Ion Torpedoes are absolutely ridiculous in how much danger they pose to fighters. They lock on for so long that if you can't get them to swerve into the terrain with your evasion, you have a 50/50 chance that they'll still hit you even if you start banking as hard as you can and as fast as you can. And if they hit you, that's already a significant chunk of your fighter health gone. Hell, the fact that you can't control your fighter until after the *entire* animation has finished is severely crippling, even after the fighter's finished flipping and starts flying straight, but the camera hasn't finished perfectly centering yet. Several times I've thought I could evade a torpedo and make it slam into the terrain, and I did, but my fighter continued to fly straight towards the ground. And then the animation finally ends and I'm allowed to pull up, but then my fighter erupts in a fantastic fireball because the belly of my solid-durasteel military-grade fighter grazed the fresh snow at lowest speeds. I don't know how pilots are expected to even land their ships if they explode the second they touch *anything*. Also, the worst offender of the mechanics category is that the fighters control like their pilots are outright drunk. Movements are incredibly sluggish. The faux-joystick control of the mouse is just disgusting.

DLC Playlists killed the game. There's no better way to put it. Splitting up the already dying playerbase like that... I just can't think of any way to justify it. Locking modes and maps behind a paywall? Ech.

The partner system is gross. I keep getting partners who snipe, which means I keep getting partners who run far away from the battle, which means I keep instinctively spawning on someone the game made me able to spawn on from my experience in Battlefield, which means I have to spend a long-ass time running back to the battle. And also, the very ability to spawn on people is something I've always despised in DICE games. You can wipe out most of a squad in Battlefield, but so long as one guy is alive after it all, they can all spawn right back in like nothing happened. In Battlefront, this means two guys can sit up in some hard-to-reach area by your spawn and just blast you before you can reach the objective. Even if you kill one of them, so long as the other is able to crouch out of your blaster sights, they'll be able to have their partner spawn back in and keep spawncamping. And even if it's not far-off sniping like that, they can still run around amidst the cover of your spawn point with EE-4s and bactaguard and keep spawnkilling you, with one hiding long enough to spawn in their partner should you manage to kill one of them. Both situations have happened way too many times on Jundland Wastes as Empire, mainly stage 3 Walker Assault.

Anti-cheat was laughable. Just a few days ago I was in a DLC server where someone was hacking. I just decided to quit and find another server, but couldn't. So I ended up having to re-join the server, and I got put on the hacker's team. Alright, at least I could *pretend* to be having a good time, and *pretend* that my win was guaranteed. But nah, [turns out the other team had a hacker as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/6krbzi/helicoptero11_runs_damage_hacks_report_pls_video/). Currently I'd estimate that every server I join has a 10-15% chance of having at least one hacker in it.

Aside from all of that, even the minor things in the game I despise with a passion. Like, I hate the menus. I absolutely *hate* the menus. I don't know why exactly I hate the menus, but I do. Everything is so blindingly bright. Every time you boot up the game, you have to wait those few seconds for the game to connect to the servers, which it couldn't do as it was booting up. The menus have a sub-section dedicated to **Base Command**, which is just it telling you how to get the Companion App. The menus have a section dedicated the the *Season Pass*, which just tells you how to ~~give DICE/EA more money~~ buy the season pass. The menus are the worst villain of the Star Wars franchise, surpassing even Abeloth, whom Jedi and Sith worked together to merely *slow down*. They are a stain upon the collective history of humanity.

I really started this post as a few points of why I wanted a fully new game, then figured I could expand a little. Now my text box is about 6x the original size and the scroll bar is smaller than expected. I hope that Battlefront 2017 is an amazing game, because the Star Wars franchise deserves *way* better than Battlefront 2015. And if Battlefront 2 *isn't* a totally new game and *doesn't* stray from things like those I addressed, then I'm sort of afraid that it will end up dead like the current game.

**TL;DR: I hated Battlefront 2015 because it sucked super hard in my opinion for more reasons than just ""wah this gun kilt me."" I'm pretty sure that if Battlefront 2 doesn't make radical changes then it will die like Battlefront 2015.**",,,,pc2,,False,,False,,,,,False,,True,t3_6lbuev,,,,,,,,,reality checker,,1499235205.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1500966308.0,,,

t5_2qhx4,,,,1499187731,,,,,,,Fitness,,,,,,djrspzo,,,0,,,,benbequer,False,,t3_6l3sw3,11,,,,,,"Okay, some serious advice that takes into account my recent experiences. In brief, I'm 47 and spent the last 15 years sitting on my butt, at first as a video editor and more recently as an author. I returned 18 weeks ago and I've had some successes and some setbacks. Here goes.

1. Go to the doctor. I'm not screwing around here. Go. Now. THEN the rest. I'm not kidding, I'll find out where you live. Okay, I'm kidding, but go see your doctor. Get checked out, a full physical, bloodwork (in particular thyroid and testosterone), and if your doctor feels it's necessary, a stress test. At 40, you should be fine, but we can't assume there isn't any funny business going on in your veins and arteries. Back before I became fat-boy Ben, I had a bad experience at the gym - a guy dropped two bikes over from me and died right there. Get yourself checked.
2. Start slow. Okay, you got yourself checked out and you're good to go. Don't go crazy. Listen to your body, but please, please, don't start repping 225 lbs your first week, just cause you used to.
3. Cardio. You have to do it. Cardio + strength training is the best way to go, and it's more efficient if you do the lifting first, THEN the cardio.
4. Time. Don't bother going for more than 1 hour at first, including your cardio work out. You want to get into a rhythm, of going every couple of days (or every day, if that's your thing), but it won't happen if you overdo it. Remember, there's no hurry. You'll achieve the things you want to, but like everything, it takes time. So start slow and don't spend too long at the gym at first. Later on, you can do the gym rat thing all you want.
5. Diet. This is really number 1 in priority. Find the food types and diet style that makes sense for you, but do your research, and make eating as much of a priority as everything else. Some people say that what you're in bad/poor shape diet is 80% and exercise is 20%. Whatever the true number is, it's high, so take your eating seriously. Whether you go Peleo or go heavy protein (chicken and broccoli 5x a day), or whatever, make sure you're serious about food, and that you're doing what works for you.
6. Get a wireless set of earbuds. I know, it's a silly thing, but do it and make sure you charge them every night before a workout day. Oh, and get into podcasts. You like building stuff? There's a million podcasts about it. Like cats? Just search, download them onto your smartphone and bring them into the gym. It's a nice change of pace from whatever music you're into. 
7. Playlists. Make a 30 minute playlist for when you're starting. Then make a 45 minute one, then a 60 minute one. Or several, but use the music to help you as you gain in physical ability. It'll help push you, and when the list is done, you know it's time to leave. This will help keep you from being burned out.
8. Drive. This is more personal, but make this a priority. Let your family know that it's a priority. Eventually, they'll give you your space and start encouraging you. But feel like it's one of the most important things you need to do, and if you can, make it a scheduled event. I drive my daughter to school at 7:15am, then hit the gym for 1-1.5 hours, depending on how I'm feeling and what my daily workout is. But make it an important thing, and make sure that everyone knows about it. This weekend we went to visit a bunch of family at a lake house one of them owns. Mornings, I woke up at the hotel and did the crappy machines they had and some treadmill. My family knew that I gotta get that in, then the rest of the day comes. Or else I'm cranky :)
8. Diet 2.0. Cheat. Cheat often. Do your best, but don't be a jerk about it. Having a family it's going to be hard, in particular on weekends. My girls like to have a big breakfast at a place we love down the street every Saturday. I'm not going to deny them that. So monday - friday, I eat my foods, my way. Weekends, I'm more lax. Don't be a slob, but be realistic, and if the kids want to have pizza and coke, do it! But have 1-2 slices and 1 glass of coke. So, in summary; cheat, but with limits. Yeah, that sounds better.
9. THE WAY. Some people will try to sell you on one particular type of diet, or workout, etc. There's no one way. Cross-fit works, Martial Arts works, Paleo diet works, Keto diet works. It all works if you do it right and if it's right for your body. So do your research, see all the alternatives, find what works for you, what you like. For example, I love intermittent fasting. I'm still getting the hang of it, but I try to eat my last meal as early as possible, like 6-7pm, then I try to have my first meal of the next day as late as possible. I can make it to noon-1pm pretty readily, and that's considering I do my workouts in the morning. I love it, but no, it's not for everyone. Find out what works for you, what you respond to, and get good at being polite at ""no, thanks'ing"" that dude that's telling you that hot yoga is the best thing ever.
10. (edit) Stationary Bikes. Don't bother. Really. Anyone comes here and says they're the best thing ever can go pack sand. Don't start on bike. Start on the treadmill. Now, those bike classes - freaking murder. Do those when you're hard as nails.

Some background on me. I'm 47, ph. D. in ass-sitting and novelist of late. I love sitting at the computer, reading reddit/twitter and writing my stupid stories. But I got a scare when I went to visit my doctor in my visit on Feb 2017 - I had high blood pressure and I needed to start taking a pill. That scared me and pissed me off, and sent me down a rage spiral that brought me back into the gym. I started with a friend (who's since fallen off the wagon), but I've been going 6-7 times a week for 18 weeks now. I have a good program, designed by a fitness guy, and while I may go a lot, I don't lift very heavy and I'm careful of my joints and tendons, in particular my shoulders which are total bastards - any funny twitch and I'm in agony. (They're fine, I'm being facetious).

At 14 weeks, I started to notice the lack of results. Both in muscle growth and in lack of reduction of my fat stores. I was weighing the same exact amount - 240 - which is like 40 lbs too much for a guy my height and thickness. I know that the growing muscle should weigh more than the fat I was losing, but at 14 weeks, I expected more. A quick visit to the doctor and we discovered I have low testosterone. This week I should be getting a prescription. 

Anyway, long-ass post, but I hope you get something out of it. I know a lot of guys that know a ton more than me will come here and try to correct me, but I think the point is that you've got to find your own way, do your own research. There's no ONE WAY. My sister keeps trying to sell me on Paleo, and while I'm glad it works for her, I have different needs.

Most importantly, good luck, and don't quit.

Have you ever heard of string theory? I only know of it generally, but this sounds a lot like it - with us all being connected  by common threads.  

Here's how it happened.  My fiance and I love music, and were on our way back from fireworks last night.  This song came across on his playlist. My fiance (who is the more avid Eminem listener, although thanks to him he's grown on me, because he does push the first amendment to its limits [which I also noticed during some of his older edited songs, that, even though they were edited, there were unedited versions of the albums available at the time as well.  I don't doubt that if it were 'the left' in power then, then he would've been labeled as hate speech and jailed or something]) was singing along with it (of course he has it all memorized haha).  Now me, I always like to find ways to tie songs back to real life, or stories, even if it's not something you would think to tie it to at first.  Idk, I guess I just like analyzing things. 

 We had been joking about all of the green and white fireworks being signs of Pepe and Kek (hey, there were quite a few that occurred together!), so while listening to the song, and thinking of an old friend who has nearly unfriended me for supporting Trump, and how I had been in some of the same situations she's been in (she basically has been miserable her whole life and thinks she is owed by the world, so don't talk bad about her ~~socialism~~ communism), it reminded me of how it feels to be a T_D member, where you don't have to walk around on eggshells all the time.  I'm not even sure if there's anywhere else (besides with my fiance) that is like that.  

I had meant to make it it's own post, but I read your post and it felt like the perfect place to put it =) 

I've also heard the reason that the Berlin wall failed was because the one side could hear Laughter on the other side.  =)

Debbie gets him to open up, and talk, and share things he kept to himself like his playlists. He only shared these when forced (i.e. when Buddy asked not so nicely, or when Bats literally took his music).

Bats pushes Baby to actually murder someone. Where in the beginning he would avoid people getting hurt, and would take whatever shit was thrown his way if it meant less trouble (for example, keeping quiet about Buddy planning to kill Bats after the heist for Darling).

&gt; Jessica Hilda Mauboy (born 4 August 1989) is an Australian singer and songwriter who rose to prominence on the fourth season of Australian Idol in 2006, placing second behind winner Damien Leith. Since Idol, she has released two solo albums which were certified gold and platinum respectively.  She has multiple singles from her second album ""Been Waiting"" that  have charted extremely well particularly the #1 single ""Burn"", ""Running Back"" and ""Because"".  She was one of the support act for Beyonce Knowles on tour ""I Am..."" along with US Singer and Rapper, Flo Rida.

&gt; Jessica Hillda Mauboy's father is of Timorese-Indonesian origin while her mother is of Indigenous Australian, Native American and English descent.

&gt; At 14, she won the Telstra 'Road to Tamworth' competition, with the grand prize being a single recording contract with Sony BMG.  She then recorded a country version of Cyndi Lauper's ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"". Years later, during Australian Idol, this contract became a source of controversy, with certain media reports stating that already having a recording contract was against the rules of Idol.  Grundy Television said Mauboy's experiences in Tamworth had no bearing on her involvement in Australian Idol and that she no longer had a contract with Sony, allowing her to participate in the competition. 

&gt; Jessica cites Mariah Carey and Michael Jackson as her musical influences; naming Carey's hits ""My All"", ""Anytime You Need A Friend"", ""Butterfly"" and ""Hero"" as personal favourites.

&gt; In the summer of 2006, Jessica auditioned for the fourth season of Australian Idol in Alice Springs. She sang the Whitney Houston hit ""I Have Nothing"" and her powerful rendition impressed all three judges Mark Holden, Marcia Hines and Kyle Sandilands. Marcia stated that Mauboy was one of the most naturally blessed singers she had ever come across.  She made it through to the theatre rounds with a unanimous ""yes"" and performed at the Kimberley Moon Experience.  She came first runner-up in the finale.

&gt; On 10 December 2006, it was announced that Mauboy had secured a recording contract with Sony BMG, with company spokesman Denis Handlin stating that her debut album would be released in mid-2007. 

&gt; On 24 December 2007, Mauboy performed ""When a Child Is Born"" and Mariah Carey's ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"" at the annual 'Carols by Candlelight' event in Melbourne.

&gt; Rather than rushing through a debut album as most Idol contestants do, it was decided that while Jessica recorded her first studio album, she would release a live album containing performances from her appearances as a contestant on Australian Idol, in order to keep her in the mind of the public.

&gt; On 24 February 2007, Mauboy released The Journey, a live album containing her Idol performances.  The album debuted and peaked at number four on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified gold for the sale of 35,000 copies.

&gt; On 26 September 2007, after much speculation, Mauboy was introduced to the public as the new member of The Young Divas - a group of four female contestants from Idol who cover old songs.  Mauboy replaced one of the group's founding members, Ricki-Lee Coulter, who had featured on the group's debut album, but departed in June 2007 in order to concentrate on her solo career. The first Young Divas single to feature vocals from Mauboy, ""Turn Me Loose"", was released on 17 November 2007, and after debuting at number 21, the song peaked at number fifteen. The group's second studio album (and first with Mauboy) 'New Attitude' was released a week later on 24 November and debuted at #10.  The album was quickly certified gold for sales of 35,000 copies.

&gt; On 28 March 2008, after six months of apparent inactivity, the Young Divas' record label, Sony BMG announced in The Daily Telegraph that due to the under performance of ""Turn Me Loose"", a second single would not be released from New Attitude. However, it was also stated that the group were not being dropped from the record label's line-up of artists and would continue to record music.

&gt; In early June 2008, Mauboy signed on to the Australian Government 'In2Oz' program, designed to promote closer ties with Indonesia.   As a part of this program, she travelled to Indonesia for a week long trip performing around the country. She also performed on Indonesian Idol, singing ""Crazy in Love"" and ""Sempurna"" (Perfect) with former Indonesian Idol stars Mike, Judika and Lucky.

&gt; On 24 August 2008, following months of rumours, it was officially announced that after a year with the group, Mauboy had decided to quit the Young Divas in order to focus on her solo career.  Founding member Paulini Curuenavuli had also decided to depart, leaving Kate DeAraugo and Emily Williams as the only remaining members of the group, though their manager David Champion stated that the Divas would undergo a third line-up change following the departures of Mauboy and Paulini, with a third album to be released later in the year.

&gt; Mauboy's debut solo single ""Running Back"", featuring American rapper Flo Rida, was released for download on 23 September 2008 and physical sales commenced on 11 October 2008.  The single peaked at number 3, spent nineteen weeks on the singles chart and achieved double platinum status for sales of over 140,000 copies.  It has also peaked at number 1 on the ARIA Urban Charts.  The music video was filmed in the Docklands area of Melbourne, Victoria in Australia.  Her debut studio album 'Been Waiting' was released on 22 November 2008 and debuted at number 16 peaking at number 11 on the ARIA Album Charts in its ninth week.  It peaked at number 1 on the ARIA Urban Charts and was certified platinum for sales of over 70,000 copies.  The album was released in Japan on April 22, 2009 and she will promote the album there later in the year.  In March 2009, it was announced that Mauboy would release her debut album in the UK and would start promotion in June after signing a contract with the Ministry of Sound label.  The deal made Mauboy only the second Australian Idol contestant ever to sign a UK record deal, after Ricki-Lee.

&gt; Mauboy's second single, ""Burn"" was released on December 6, 2008 and debuted at number 30 but after 7 weeks of rising up the ARIA singles chart it hit the number 1 spot, making it Mauboy's first number one single.  It spent over twenty weeks on the chart and achieved platinum status.  Like her first single, it too peaked at number 1 on the ARIA Urban Charts. The single made its debut on the Japan Hot 100 at number ninety-two on April 25, 2009.

&gt; On January 26, 2009 at the annual Australia Day concert Mauboy announced that the title track of her album ""Been Waiting"" would be her next single.  The song was meant to make its debut on radio on February 16, 2009 but was pushed forward due to Burn being removed from most radio playlists in light of the devastating bush fires in Victoria.  The single was officially released on 14 March 2009 and Mauboy performed it live on Funniest Home Videos on Saturday 4 April. The single peaked at number 12 on the official ARIA charts and at #6 on the ARIA Urban Charts.

&gt; In the week of 25 May 2009, fourth single ""Because"" was the number-one most added track on Australian radio.  The single was released on June 12 and debuted on the ARIA Charts at number nine.

&gt; Her fifth single, ""Up/Down"", is expected to be released in September 2009 to coincide with her appearances supporting Beyoncé Knowles and Flo Rida on their Australian tours.

Han &amp; Norra's Infinite Playlist  
===============================  

99 points  

Pilots  
------  

Norra Wexley (37)  
ARC-170 (29), R2-D2 (4), Push the Limit (3), Nien Nunb (1), Alliance Overhaul (0)  

Han Solo (62)  
YT-1300 (46), Push the Limit (3), C-3PO (3), Gunner (5), Millennium Falcon (Evade Version) (1), Engine Upgrade (4)  

------  

**Changes**  
Han Solo  
Removed nothing.  
Added Gunner &amp; Push the Limit.  
Gunner simply adds a LOT more consistency to Han. Roll out your attack dice and if you get 1 or fewer hits then you reroll them using Han's ability. If that attack goes poorly again then Gunner triggers and you get your second attack. If you roll 1 or fewer hits on that second attack then use Han reroll (since this is a new attack). Also with Push the Limit you can Evade + Boost / Focus EVERY turn which will make Han a real terror. This is my pretty standard Fat Han build I've been using for ages and I love it.  

Norra Wexley  
Removed Expose, Experimental Interface.  
Added Push the Limit.  
Normally Expose is just bad. It's 4 points to spend an action to get +1 red die at the cost of 1 green die. And here it's the ONLY green die you have! Given Norra doesn't even have an Evade action even with R2-D2 she'll die very easily. PTL allows her to focus + target lock EVERY turn. On the offense this means a 4 die attack with a guaranteed damage on one of the 4 die. Very importantly on DEFENSE this gives her the equivalent of an evade action that also focuses her 1 agi die if it happens to roll a focus! In addition to R2-D2 / Nien Nunb this gives her a powerful combination of attack / defense that should make her frustrating to deal with!

All in all my proposed list gives you 2 ships with lots of space coverage (primary weapon turret and a ship with a rear firing arc!), highly consistent damage (Gunner + Han, TL + Focus on Norra), and good survivability (13 hp on Han with 2 guaranteed evades / turn with Evade &amp; C-3PO, 9 HP on Norra with TL + Focus for pseudo-evade).",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6kxhwo,,,,,,,,,,,1499093400.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499868017.0,,,

I like a challenge. I'm going to try and help you, man. Few things hurt worse than when no one replies.

Clicked the second one, recognized the sample (again, I think many people would) but liked the retool of it as a beat. Both songs definitely have that cool badass walking music vibe. I decided to look into their genres and specifically Rob Dougan to see if anything interesting came up, and I'm going to list all the things I did to look into him, and share what I found.

Did a music-map and a jump off Taste Dive ([both are pretty useful,](https://tastedive.com) [in my experience](https://www.music-map.com)), and even did a quick last.fm search… and **of course** the first recognizable things that pop up are Matrix soundtrack related. Still, must be for a reason, so definitely check out the Don Davis-composed music for the Matrix. He also did music for other films, but no one seems to remember any of those (don’t worry, he’s still getting work; he’s composing the live-action Tokyo Ghoul movie due out at the end of July).

Juno Reactor helped Don especially on the last movie/album. The final fight in Revolutions was scored to “Neodämmerung” (and Juno Reactor remixed it later for the credits in “Navras”).

Lunatic Calm I had to refresh my memory. The song “Leave You Far Behind” (and/or whatever remix was on the first Matrix soundtrack) reminded me of a song from the Cowboy Bebop soundtrack, “Pushing the Sky.”

Uh, other common names I saw that I recognized were Fluke, E.S. Posthumus, Royksopp, and Clint Mansell. Fluke (I thought it was Flume, like the trap artist lol) did soundtracks for Sin City, the Matrix, Need for Speed games, things like that. E.S. Posthumus is one of those “epic music” groups that does music for like, trailers and stuff. Don’t think either of these are what you’re looking for, but are worth bringing up. 

Royksopp also came up. [“Royksopp Forever”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM_txL43iFM) takes about half the song for the strings to come in, but it’s definitely worth it.

Clint Mansell actually, maybe it’s not him, but someone remixed his song “Requiem for a Dream” into something more palletable and people love it and use that version all the time. [“Requiem for a Tower.”]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaioIutcHKI) You’ll recognize it.

After this, I looked up Rob Dougan on Wikipedia (the most reliable website), see one of the genres he's classified as is ""neoclassical dark wave."" Click to look into it. Abney Park is classified as such, but I disagree based on [what I listened to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EX11Xi4pak) (more like steampunk rock or something). Bands like Arcana ([their cover of “Enigma of the Absolute”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkTvKGr87TY) was used as a soundtrack in a video game, so that’s something) came up too, but overall I don't think this is what you're trying to find.

Trip hop was another genre Mr. Dougan was said to be, and you know what? It’s not neoclassical or anything, but Massive Attack could be something you’re looking for, vocals and otherwise. They did the theme to House MD, [”Teardrop”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7K72X4eo_s) which is a good jumping in point.

(I'm also kind of reminded of Glitch Mob, which you might like .)

Thinking of this, and of your specific request for dark and foreboding… my mind went to the opposite for a bit. Post-rock music. Stuff that’s, not upbeat, but feels more… positive. Sound that engulfs you, more than melodies that make you feel. Stuff like Explosions in the Sky! That’d be something I’d want, you know? The music from Friday Night Lights.

Basically, I’m at a loss for stuff that’s like legit similar to what Rob Dougan does. This is beyond me. To be sure, I did do a quick look on iTunes (looked up him, clicked on a song, lead me to an album he did. At the bottom, ""people also bought"") and I found one I liked: [""Clutter"" by Ronald Jenkees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBcZdNY6LdY)

After all of this, I basically traversed a lot of music subreddits, old threads, to see if anything came up. They don’t ask for the exact thing you ask for, but they seem worth bringing up.

Stumbled upon an album, *Wide Awake* by Hybrid, which was a recurring name I've seen over and over. From what I can tell, they seem to be the gold standard for this kind of music.

In addition to that, the Venetian Snares' album *Rossz Csillag Alatt Született* is a breakbeat album with classical strings and brass. Sounds promising. Fun fact: title was referenced in Marvel comics featuring the character Winter Soldier.

[“Chaos Light”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL9pS09Pm9w) by Lunar starts with building up, and it gets some DnB development, but it still to me has that vibe. 

[“Reign”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkSi6bTrPu0) by UNKLE and Ian Brown also has this sort of sinister vibe to it, which is part of what you’re looking for. It has vocals. Don’t know if that’s a turn off.

Though it’s short (all the songs on the album are short!), “Retro” from the Notre Jour Viendra soundtrack could be put on a similar playlist. The rest of the album seems to mostly just be the classical route, not the beat route.

This reminded me, though, of the Chemical Brothers’ score for the film Hanna. There was a review somewhere that praised the music for its mix of violence and innocence, so maybe check that out too. I personally like [Hanna’s theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWd6wUh3mGo) ([here’s the vocal version as well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZtEtiJxQxM)). 

All the songs I shared I put on my iTunes wishlist or is already in my collection, which I hope says something. I apologize if this isn’t what you asked. I hope you find what you’re looking for.

EDIT: Oh heck, you know what? The John Wick soundtracks are really freakin' great. Definitely look into those. Also, [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_PVt231FBE) sounds a bit like it could fit that Clubbed to Death feel.

You have all been amazing and I am so glad to have found such a cool and supportive wedding related community during this often lonely and emotionally fraught process.

My husband and I got engaged last fall and planned our wedding within eight months — no small feat in New York City! We were originally gunning for an early fall date, but we found out that our preferred venue was closing for what we were told were private kitchen renovations over the summer and through the early fall (which, in fact, ended up being a full renovation of the entire restaurant) and figured, what the hell, let’s push the wedding up a few months. I was afraid that the short amount of time that we had to plan would severely restrict our choice of vendors, since so many book up a year or more in advance, but every single one of our first choices were available on our wedding day. It was a pleasant surprise, and all of our vendors were absolutely fantastic and I would recommend any and all of them to anyone getting married in NYC or the metro area. (Let me know if you want names.)

Both of us are fairly introverted and huge food/beverage people, so we prioritized a small guest list and incredible food and cocktails. In the end, we invited 27 people, with 25 RSVPing with a yes and all 25 attending, and we got married at a 3 Michelin-starred restaurant where not a single person ended up with rubbery chicken.

I’ll provide a more extensive budget breakdown if anyone wants one, but we ended up spending in the neighborhood of ~$30k for everything. “Everything” includes the venue (which hosted both the ceremony and reception and which took care of the space, food and alcohol, our wedding cake, guest favors, floral centerpieces, place and escort cards, and setup and breakdown), our officiant, our photographer, my wedding gown and accessories, my husband’s suit and wedding band (my band is a heirloom), invitations, our ketubah, my bouquet,  hair and makeup for myself, my mom, and my best friend, and our hotel rooms. We saved a little money by not having a DJ and not having bridesmaids/groomsmen, but that was more the result of having an intimate wedding rather than an attempt to cut corners. We received a generous gift from my family, which softened the financial blow a little, but I will say that we did not spend beyond what we could afford.

I was fully expecting so many things to go wrong on the day, but other than a few little snafus, everything was absolutely perfect. Frankly, the fact that the hotel concierge held my bouquet until I called up for it (which I only discovered after calling my florist in a panic when my bouquet was an hour late, of course), or that the ketubah’s overlay fell off the easel upon which it was meant to be displayed, or that the cocktail music playlist was initially put on shuffle by the captain when it should not have been (an error that was very quickly corrected), did not matter at all. Getting married in a beautiful and meaningful ceremony in front of our closest friends and family and throwing a party to celebrate our love during which everyone ate and drank and talked and danced with gusto and left telling us that it was the best wedding they’d attended — that’s what mattered, and I’ll never forget it.

I’ll probably hang around here for a while to come, but in case that ends up not being the case, thanks for all the fish, and best of luck to all of you awesome marrieds-to-be!",,,,blue,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6kxc04,,,,,,,,,married! | 6.3.2017 | NYC,,1499050212.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499857814.0,,,

1. Study harder than you party

2. Party as hard as you possibly can

This is pretty flexible depending how your program works. General requirement classes are *pitifully* easy. Build good habits so you know how to buckle in and study when the classes get tough, but definitely take advantage of the early classes to expand your social circle and take advantage of some extra time. 

In terms of workouts, 3-4x a week is good. If you're an especially scrawny guy, you should be focusing on getting stronger, healthier, and bigger in general (this was me when I started as well). Please, for fuck's sake, don't skip leg day. Guys and girls alike make jokes out of guys who only train arms/abs. 

When it comes to girls and pickup, college can be hilariously easy if you build the right lifestyle. Your priority should be personal growth and having a blast, and these include both individual and group goals. Build social circles around your interests, join clubs/teams you might like, and talk to *everyone*. Talk to people on campus, in class, at the dining hall, etc. If you can socialize with anyone it becomes much easier to talk to that cute girl over there. 

If you don't want to be in a frat, that's fine, but don't bash the greek life. Frat guys have *incredible* access to huge groups of attractive girls, so getting to know some greeks and getting access to the events will only push your progress forward. They're a rowdy bunch but they can be a damn good time (and the chicks can be fucking fantastic lays). 

Fashion is mostly about fit. You don't need to wear a particular style of clothing and you *definitely* don't need to wear expensive, designer outfits as long as the style you go for includes clothing that fits your body well. I don't normally recommend /r/malefashionadvice because they're very one-dimensional, but if you go through that sub and look for posts just about fitting, you can get some good advice. Alpha M also has a good [playlist] (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyqPLT4V7ooLJ7QYNguRX2d-xXhzywfvV) on style that you can browse through for some more visuals. 

I don't wear band shirts nor would I recommend them, but if that's your style and they *fit*, go for it. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6kwd13,,,,,,,,,,,1499042990.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499855595.0,,,

Also, I went out with friends tonight (hence the failure to stay under my limit), BUT this amazing thing happened: I ordered a plate of falafels with salad, ate the salad and some of the falafels, felt full and *stopped eating*.

Hey all,We are pretty close to wrapping up beta 2.4! We are now working on the finishing touches, and will soon begin bug testing (as soon as we can get a stable development branch build). Stay tuned for more updates on that via our development discussion forum or via social media/Discord.Beta 2.3 PostmortemBeta 2.3 turned out to be our biggest major update to date, followed by some of the biggest minor updates as well, all the way up to beta 2.3.3. During this period, we were also developing the multiplayer update (which will most likely be beta 2.5 based on player feedback). Beta 2.3 introduced some highly requested features such as character customization, custom seeds, and more. A lot of the changelog in beta 2.3 focused on improvements, because we feel it is important to improve the game and fix bugs rather than just keep adding content. In beta 2.4, we are shifting this a bit in response and adding quite a bit of content this time around.Beta 2.4 PreviewsWe've been releasing a fairly steady stream of beta 2.4 previews. If you have been out of the loop, here's a sampling of them now:Kindling GroupsAnd much rejoice was had by all! Introducing kindling groups (and wooden dowels). No more wooden pole stockpiles or searching for tree bark!Dismantle Item PreviewsNew Plant &amp; Tree GrowthThis sped up preview shows the new growth stages with custom graphics for each stage, ability to plant and grow trees just like any other plant, and the new harvest ability.Caves OverhaulForest BiodiversityIf you want to keep up to date with Wayward and these previews, come join us on Twitter, Facebook or Reddit!Player SurveyRecently, we released a player survey to help us get a better, data-driven look at what Wayward players think about the development of the project and to rate their experience with the game. We realized relying on Steam Reviews alone doesn't give us the full picture, especially for a project that changes so rapidly.It should only take a few minutes if you want to participate: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIKSwYgcZn3lktb-ZC5r8IpfQ7NU0ce_GSxQy7RWWmWheDwg/viewformBeta 2.4 Wishlist/PollSpeaking of player feedback, our wishlist and poll for beta 2.4 this time around attracted a pretty large turn-out. Luckily some of the highest rated items were items we already wanted to focus on, like new fruits, veggies, growth stages, non-destructive harvest, renewable tree growth and more cultivation goodies. That, and a healthy dose of UI improvements. We are now also seeing a healthy amount of requests for NPCs, so that will likely be pushed sooner rather than later. Next though, it's likely you'll see a multiplayer update for beta 2.5 based on the response in the past.Wishlist: http://steamcommunity.com/app/379210/discussions/0/1318836262657142382/Poll: https://poll.ly/#/GgOABNxzFeatured ModsWe always get a good feeling when somebody likes Wayward enough to create mods for it. Here's a few recent one we want to showcase.Equilibrium by YenwoodGiven enough time, everything reverts to its natural state. Malignity and benignity will slowly return to 0. The rate of this is configurable through the options.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=932165902Beards by Adrien S EnzoAdds a set of beards and alternate hairdos to the character customization screen. BECAUSE BEARDS!http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=901300138Philosopher's Stone by TheDuckPancakeThis mod adds a philosopher's stone item which can be used to transmute common items like leaves or stones into more valuable ones like iron or coal.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=899709064DiscordThe ""Wayward Kin"" Discord is definitely the place to be as a Wayward fan. You'll see weekly-ish updates (as they happen to the development build), discussions on Wayward itself, previews of upcoming features, and probably the occasional discourse on random global economic issues or whatever. Come hang out!https://discordapp.com/invite/0W1JEHHVVKmaxyP9Wayward Let's Plays ShowcaseThere's been a couple long playthroughs of Wayward recently, some by the likes of:RoguelikerAs the name suggest, Rogueliker, AKA Chris, has a channel filled with roguelike gameplay. He has covered tons of roguelike and roguelite games, recently added Wayward to that growing list.Wayward video playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDJGj71kLY5Uk1xA8q96xcs_tQUE__NQULong Journey DividedLong Journey Divided, AKA ""ACryInShame"" focuses on strategy and RPG games, with most recently a lot of Factorio gameplay, but also recently mixed a little bit of Wayward into that routine.Wayward video playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQB-JZPK0X3cIlC_Pi30aO2JX4QCAAdWd

### Songs of the Storm — Specialists ###

Blizzard Entertainment / Blog post

[{Image}](//bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/blog_header/mj/MJ8EX46T43XH1495834158049.jpg)
Inspired by the release of [the official Heroes of the Storm soundtrack](http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20819271/heroes-of-the-storm-soundtrack-5-30-2017), we started compiling unofficial playlists for each role in the game, starting with the game’s [mighty Warriors](http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20812214); we moved on to their kind, gentler counterparts with [Supports](http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/blog/20861967/songs-of-the-storm-supports-6-22-2017). Now, we’re on to Specialists. It can be hard to define what makes a Specialist a Specialist, given how each of the different Heroes in this group brings their own unique flavor and style to the battlefield. But what makes them all . . . err, special . . . is that they can manipulate the ebb and flow of battle in more complex, graceful ways than their counterparts (damage-dealing Assassins and armor-heavy Warriors).

 

So what do they all listen to? What’s Abathur pumping through his slimy space slug earbuds while pushing out one lane with locusts and simultaneously supporting his allies in a teamfight with his magical Zerg hat? Let’s find out. 

**Azmodan** 

+ [**Space Jam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrMOxASAmP0) by Quad City DJs

*Azmodan might not be the greatest evil in the Nexus—the number-one spot is taken by Prime Evil Diablo, of course. But “Azmodunk” is the undisputed Lord of the Court and has all the best trash talk. The Lord of Sin puts Steph Curry to shame with his long-ranged Globes of Annihilation. You only get to the top of the ladder with a lot of practice, of course, so how often do you think Azmodan does push-ups to the Quad City DJs?* 

**Zagara** 

+ **[Creep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlZydtG3xqI)** by TLC

*There was a lot of discussion internally over whether to use Radiohead’s or TLC’s “Creep” for the Overqueen of the Swarm. Ultimately we settled on the TLC track because of the tone of the song. While Radiohead’s is undoubtedly a classic, it’s also a song about the alienation and shame of being a social pariah. TLC’s Creep, on the other hand, is an empowering anthem about a woman taking back control of her love life from an unfaithful lover. Zagara is not ashamed of her monstrous nature; she takes control of her battlefield by laying down her own Creep—but she doesn’t even bother keeping it on the down low.* 

**Sgt. Hammer** 

+ **[War Pigs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQUXuQ6Zd9w)** by Black Sabbath

*Those on the frontlines of the Terran army don’t always know the real reasons why they go to war . . . but whether she’s fighting for precious minerals, her home planet, or just another General’s leaderboard position, Sgt. Hammer turns up the Black Sabbath and rains down some hellfire.* 

**Murky** 

+ **[Yakety Sax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zcq_xLi2NGo)** by Boots Randolph

Murky, to the tune of Yakety Sax: 

*“MRGLGRGLGLBRGRGL aurrrrrrrrruuuuggguglugglugglugluguaa rwlrwlrwlrwl—“* 

*\*Slaps The Butcher in the face with a fish.\**

*t—rwlrwlrwlrwl MRGLGRGLGLBRGRGL aurrrrrrrrruuuuggguglugglugglugluguaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!”* 

**Sylvanas** 

+ **[Banshee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dW56jXJBKE)** by Dance with The Dead

Once the proud Ranger-General of Silvermoon, Sylvanas got really into eighties-style horror synth pop after she was slain by Arthas and began to dance with the dead. 

**Nazeebo** 

+ **[Voodoo Child](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZBlqcbpmxY)** by Jimi Hendrix

With his penchant for communing with otherworldly spirits, handling psychoactive toads, summoning spiders with his incantations, Nazeebo is easily the most mind-expanding hero in the Nexus. Can’t you just picture his Ravenous Spirit shredding a guitar solo? 

**Medivh** 

+ **[Raven Wing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAKvZKRk_Rs)** by Iced Earth

*“I am the wise shape-shifter / and I am always there.”* Medivh is the nosiest of specialists—hovering insistently above his enemies while they take mercenary camps, thwarting their every attempt to execute an ambush against his allies. He’s always there, the mystic spirit guide of any team comp he’s part of, flying on blackened wings. 

**Probius** 

+ **[The Robots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXa9tXcMhXQ)** by Kraftwerk

Kraftwerk was one of the first bands to prove music could be funneled through mechanized devices, rather than traditional instruments, to produce true works of art. So too did Probius, the Probe with a soul, convince his bigger and more formidable-looking peers that even the tiniest and most mechanical of Protoss units can still boast overwhelming power. *We are the robots!* 

**Gazlowe** 

+ **[“Crawling from the Wreckage”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4p8RYoJ9DQ)** by Dave Edmunds

Where others see a heaping pile of junk, Gazlowe sees opportunity. The Boss of Ratchet knows better than anyone else how to turn bits and ends of distended metal into a formidable killing machine, giving new meaning to the phrase “Crawling from the Wreckage” with his famously irritating turrets and gravity bombs. 

**Abathur** 

+ **[“Wear My Hat”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbhgzA98IAY)** by Mac Miller

Abathur’s Symbiote is the most powerful hat to enter the Nexus, granting its wearer an extra layer of protection and damage to dish out against their enemies. Just make sure you give it back—the space slug can be very territorial. 

**The Lost Vikings** 

+ **[“Me Myself &amp; I”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJEzEDMqXQQ)** by De La Soul

Erik, Baleog, and Olaf might *seem* like three separate entities. And on one level, they are. But they’re also part of the same whole. No matter how many different lanes they split-push down, they always seem to end up back together as one at the end of the day—just Me, Myself, and I. 

**Xul** 

+ **[“Thriller”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOnqjkJTMaA)** by Michael Jackson

*The foulest stench is in the air* 

*The funk of forty thousand years* 

*And grizzly ghouls from every tomb* 

*Are closing in to seal your doom* 

 
The Necromaster Xul can be one scary dude. Just like his [Diablo counterpart](https://us.battle.net/d3/en/), he summons skeletal warriors and zombie walls to take down his foes—and to keep him company, because being a brooding, dark anti-hero can get lonely sometimes. But he’s not without a sense of humor, which makes us think he’d love disco-funk in addition to communing with the undead. 

Do you agree with our choices, or do you have other sweet bangers to suggest? Let us know what you think of the songs so far, and what you’d pick for the Assassin heroes coming up next week!

 

**Rock on, heroes. We’ll see you all in the Nexus!**

Here is the typical obligatory post everyone makes about masters! Made it towards the very end of ToTG so no new memes allowed :( but I know some people like to check this stuff out anyways [so the full playlist is there if you wanna see the grind -&gt; trials]!

Proof pic [always hated this post and like to just take people's word for it]: http://imgur.com/a/6pR3L

^ thats not really proof after realizing what I took a screenshot of LOL so check the video otherwise


Decklists used here: http://imgur.com/a/j6zHD

- Dragon - the main choices here for the deck were the inclusion of enough storm in the deck to beat some unfavorable matchups [aegis, maybe dshift] and lightning blast [nephthys, dragon ouro]. Overall the deck is very dragon but could use more $$ as always haha

- Shadow - the choices here are pretty standard, but I did think a 3rd phantom howl was HUGE in contributing to wins, eachtar and reaper were super strong but phantom howl required so much less setup to be effective. Overall pretty standard and could use another Cerberus, but evening out all decks instead of focusing one finishing ONE is more my style lol

- Blood - the main choices here was to -1 grimnir because you dont hit 10 value often and being more aggro was the plan, then -1 imp lancer because although it is aggressive in terms of immediate storm the problem is it bricked just a bit too often to be a 3x, and finally the addition of +2 flowerbeds made the list VERY AGGRESSIVE and on curve devastating in how much damage you can push [especially with a turn 4 belphegor, the flowerbed will usually only hit you for 1 damage after belph vengeance proc]. Overall FEELS GOOD MAN was the most fun deck to play to get lethal and almost lethal yourself too haha

All these lists during the time of climbing did pretty well and all had winstreaks of ~8+ at some point [blood being the highest at ~20 at some point then a loss then another almost 20 haha]

It might be worth a watch if you're not so familiar with it all. The first few videos in the playlist should explain the history around the battle they're marching in memory of: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD3A90D6D409BB4BE

Simplifying it, these guys march every year to commemorate the [Battle of the Boyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Boyne), where the Protestant forces fighting under Dutch Prince William of Orange defeated Catholic forces who were supporting the deposed Catholic King James II of England. It marked not only the end of Catholic monarchy in Britain (England and Scotland back then), but it also essentially ended any threat to British rule over (largely Catholic) Ireland. Up until that point, the minority protestant population of Ireland (which largely arrived there during waves of English and later Scottish colonisation of the island), had felt themselves outnumbered and under threat from the Irish catholic population. Irish protestants saw the Boyne as the point where the the tables were finally turned for good in their favour, and so commemorated it every year afterwards as a show of force.

In Glasgow, we have a large population descended from Irish settlers (both Catholic and Protestant) who came over mostly in the mid-1800s to escape the Irish famine, bringing their heated sectarian rivalry and traditions with them. It's toned down a bit in recent decades, but to this day there is a small but significant protestant population that still takes to the streets every year to commemorate this battle. Basically, there's no real good reason people would march to commemorate it other than bigotry. It's a public show of force designed to make Irish Catholics remember that they were 'quelled', and that the Protestant population had now gained power. 

That of course bears no relation to modern Scotland, but there you go. If you were to ask these people of the detail of the history, I reckon they'd be hard pushed to explain it to you, maybe aside from the most hardcore marchers. Most do it cause their dad did it, and cause his dad's dad did it, and so on and so on. It's ingrained as a tradition at this stage, carried out by bigots and morons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6kb5q3,,,,,,,,,,,1498772369.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499774668.0,,,

The very lowest is Bronze 1, division 1. At the end of each season Psyonix gives out cosmetic rewards based on the highest rank you achieved during the season. So toward the end of a season, which is right now, people try to push to the next rank so they can get swanky rewards.

The current season end July 5th so if you haven't played ranked yet go play your placement matches in a playlist so you at least get some rewards! You need to play 10 placement matches per playlist, and after 10 games you'll be given a rank like Bronze 2 Division 3.",,,,plat3,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6kasla,,,,,,,,,Diamonds are for never :(,,1498770336.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499773812.0,,,

(and of course, I get lucky with procs)

Honestly its mostly laziness. If there was an optimizer built into the game I would definitely be using that to double check my builds. I know it is very easy to learn and use, but I just don't want to bother with needing to get certain apps and transferring files.

We didn't have a lot of the traditional 'wedding' stuff and I found The Knot and stuff like that incredibly ridiculous in terms of the expectations (no I do not need a welcome dinner, a brunch, proposal boxes for BMs, ten BMs, two flower girls, a cigar bar, and matching kimonos to successfully get married) I mean it's great if you want those things but I found the tone to be pushing you to feel like you were an asshole if your wedding was just a wedding and not a three day, uniquely curated celebration or something.

Break things off in manageable chunks as well. And prioritize. Figuring out the playlist is important but can be done closer to the day, whereas booking a caterer and setting up rsvp stuff needs to be done sooner.

Most of the time is to avoid to connect to a weak hotspot (like the ones my internet provider offers), some ones are pretty good, but on the train it tries to connect to those hotspots just to get disconnected when the train moves away, but when I get to the office I better turn it on so data is faster than my carrier. But then many sites (entertainment, porn, lifestyle, sports) are blocked so I need to turn, again, the Wifi off, then after work to turn it off again when getting back on the train and turn it on again when at home. 

With the new toggle, I leave the house, then when the hotspot is trying to connect, hit Wifi and get disconnected, at work will auto connect, if a site I want to visit is blocked, hit the toggle again, etc. When reaching home, it automatically connected again. 

When do I want to keep Wifi off the whole time? I don’t!

And since it’s proved that Wifi and Bluetooth had zero impact on battery life, why do I need to turn Bluetooth off? Only scenario I can think of is when at a friends house when I want to start the party and connect my phone to the Bluetooth speaker play some of my playlists, get booed and another guy push me over and now he wants to put some different type of music, I don’t have to turn Bluetooth off since all I need is disconnect my phone from that device, on my way home I may want to listen some music and put my AirPods on but they aren’t connected because I forgot to turn Bluetooth ON again!",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6jym3d,,,,,,,,,,,1498722693.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499757066.0,,,

I listen to that every week, but it's just two hours, and I like to explore all the time.

My solution is to use Spotify's ""Create Similar Playlist"" (right click) option. I scan through the result and remove stuff I've heard recently or don't like, add some tracks from my favorites to replace the losses, and then I listen. Then I repeat. The playlist morphs in character over time and sometimes I stumble into whole new genres. It's a lot more work than pressing play on Pandora, but I like the results.

Spotify's radio is a travesty. Spotify's radio development team recently created Your Daily Mix, which is better, but still too repetitive, and it rarely if ever plays an artist that you've never ever played before.

You should also consider Google Play Music's ""I'm Feeling Lucky"" option after it knows you a bit. Not everybody seems to like it, but I get good results. For example, in the last 10 songs it played, I only recognized two artists, and according to last.fm I had never heard three artists and the rest of the artists I had heard only 1 or 2 times before (probably on Spotify.)

We do try to set deadlines for ourselves, typically with the goal of having them done well in advance of our yearly concert so that we can learn them all. However, those deadlines this year have gotten pushed quite a bit, and now we're putting the finishing touches on 5 new songs by this weekend. The goal being: ""Learn them all by the concert at the end of August"". It's ambitious. We're basically going to have to learn a new song each week, and then polish the ones we learned the weeks before! Looking forward to it actually...

**EDIT:**

Oh, so songs are arranged first - then auditioned after we have learned it. We usually sing the song a few times with whomever is auditioning as the lead. Then we each get two closed-eye votes. Can't vote for yourself. Winner gets the solo, runners-up gets the understudy. If there is a tie, there is a run-off.

On occasion, a client will ask us to arrange a song for a gig. So we'll charge extra for that. Part of the money goes to the arranger, and part goes to the group for learning it. The cost for that arrangement is based upon the difficulty of the song.

On occasions, we'll arrange with certain people in mind. Certain songs, only certain guys can hit those notes. Or, for instance, our musical director just arranged ""The Book of Love"" with the intent on giving our basses a chance at a low solo. (not ""who wrote the book of love"").

We try to arrange our songs with 4 parts, 5 max. This allows our group of 9 to double up on parts, and also is helpful if attendance at gigs is low.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6k1qzn,,,,,,,,,,,1498699308.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499750482.0,,,

I don't want to go too ""High Fidelity"" but some of that was very true - you want a belter for an opener, but then actually take it up a notch. No repeated artists, try for a plateau then a mellow closing song - same on both sides. A 60 minute tape for music like punk, 90s for genres with longer songs. 

They don't always fit a theme, but there is usually something quite loose. Songs of a specific year, genre, artist. Single artist compilations I try and go for a rough chronological order, depends how the band developed really. Also mixes for people - it has to be stuff I think they will like, but be quite clever. A few songs I *know* they like, but then push it slightly. Similar artists to ones they like, songs from bands they know but are underrated or obscure. What I never want to do is make a mix of stuff they *should* like, like some music snob guide to genres they have never even heard of which will just turn them off entirely. 

It hasn't changed much since CDs but you can jiggle things around a lot easier, make an mp3 playlist and listen through a few times to tweak. Tapes were a real labour of love, you had to sit through and physically do it, you could find timings didn't work, a run of songs didn't sound great, even volumes could be all over the place. Not going to romanticise that too much, it is just the way it was. I tended to make a cover rather than shove them in a CD wallet as I do now, but I do sometimes if they are a gift. The only difference in philosophy from tapes is the lack of two sides and they are slightly shorter. 

I have been making a series recently to go in the car as it has a CD player and the phone attachment is awkward. Going through every year and making a 80 minute best-of. One artist only per year still. It has really allowed me to explore my record collection too, as I know I love some albums of a particular year, but the top track of each might not actually fill a CD, or I couldn't actually pinpoint a single song. Led to some excellent discoveries and immersed me in a whole year of music with and end product of a mix CD at the end. 

Another is a ""new discoveries"" type series, partly off ther back of the best of each year CDs. So stuff I already owned or had on mp3, but only really discovered how good it was recently. How the hell had I never heard ""Dear God"" by XTC before? I had one of their records, various other post punk bands entire discographies but this song just passed me by.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6jvchx,,,,,,,,,,,1498665039.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499734569.0,,,

Like a mix tape or playlist where you'd listen and think, 'move those 2 songs apart...'

Otherwise, I agree that some of these are the best songs they have written, but I wonder if the time is soon to (again) stretch themselves and work with a new producer(s)? I know Rick Rubin is a guru and respected and great and all, but Steve Lillywhite eventually forced U2 to work with other producers because he knew that's what they needed to grow as a band. I wonder if it's time to push the envelope yet again by trying someone new in that role.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6jo553,,,,,,,,,,,1498660483.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499732479.0,,,

&gt; Yes is a British progressive rock band which formed in London, United Kingdom in 1968. They are best known for 1970's ""I've Seen All Good People"", the 1972 9-minute US Top 20 smash ""Roundabout"" and their 1983 #1 hit ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"". Despite many lineup changes, occasional splits and the influence of the many changes in popular music, the band has endured for 40 years and still retains a strong international following. Their music is marked by sharp dynamic contrasts, lush harmonies, often extended song lengths and a general showcasing of members' instrumental prowess. Arguably one of the most musically ambitious bands of their genre, Yes manages to use symphonic and other so-called ""classical"" structures with their own blend of musical styles - including some innovations - in a happy constructive ""marriage"" of music.

&gt; The original line-up consisted of Jon Anderson (vocals), Chris Squire (bass, vocals), Peter Banks (guitar, vocals), Tony Kaye (keyboards), and Bill Bruford (drums). Personnel changes brought musicians Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman into the group in 1970 and 1971 respectively. Steve Howe appears on the cover of Time and a Word, even though soon-to-be-ousted Pete Banks is the guitarist on the album. Alan White then replaced Bill Bruford in 1972.  These changes had arguably the biggest influence on their music and subsequent success. The early 1970's saw Yes as one of the few influential mainstream progressive acts.

&gt; For some fans, the double-album, four-track 1973 recording Tales from Topographic Oceans - symphonic and oddly mystical, marked a point of departure. It generally received a critical mauling in the press yet went straight to No. 1 in the UK album charts. Those listeners taken by the Tales album would be enthralled by 1974's Relayer - the only album that Patrick Moraz played keyboards on - which mixed progressive rock and a jazz fusion style that at times was very free in tunes such as ""The Gates of Delirium"". Far from their pop beginnings, this album marked a milestone for the band and for progressive rock as a whole.

&gt; During the rise of the progressive genre, Yes pioneered the use of synthesizers and sound effects, gaining large popularity with their unique brand of mysticism and grand-scale compositions. Fragile (1971) and Close to the Edge (1972) are considered their best works - symphonic, complex, cerebral, spiritual and moving. These albums featured beautiful harmonies and strong, occasionally heavy playing. Also, Fragile contained the popular hit song ""Roundabout"". With the advent of punk in 1977, many considered progressive rock dead in the water. Yes, however, proved them wrong by releasing one of their most successful albums - Going for the One, which contained ""Awaken"", a rhythmic tour-de-force.

&gt; In 1979, Anderson and Wakeman left the band after unsuccessful recording sessions in Paris.  Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes (from the new-wave band The Buggles of ""Video Killed the Radio Star"" fame) were recruited to replace them, and the band recorded Drama, their first album without Anderson on vocals.  The resulting sound was much heavier than previous albums, particularly the opening track Machine Messiah, and a strong synth-pop influence due to the involvement of Downes and Horn, which drew some criticism and the dismissive label ""Yuggles"".  While the new Yes was well-received in America, the band encountered more hostile audiences in England.   The group split up in 1981.

&gt; The band reformed in 1983 with a new lineup featuring Squire, White, South African guitarist Trevor Rabin, and the return of Jon Anderson on vocals and Tony Kaye on keyboards.  This line-up, which was eventually nicknamed ""Yes West"", recorded 90125 and Big Generator and enjoyed a resurgence in popularity.  During these years, Yes championed digital sampling technologies and sold millions of records, influencing a generation of digital musicians with hits such as ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"" and ""Rhythm of Love"".

&gt; By the end of the 1980s, Jon Anderson formed a side project with former Yes members Steve Howe, Rick Wakeman and Bill Bruford, releasing Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe in 1989.  This led to a merger in 1990 and the album Union and the following tour with all 8 members.  However, while the tour and album were commercial successes, many of the band members were dissatisfied with the album.  Union was comprised of a demo recorded by the ""Yes West"" lineup attached to what was originally recorded as the second Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe album, and was finished using session musicians.  Bruford has disowned the album entirely, and Wakeman was reportedly unable to recognise any of his keyboard work in the final edit.

&gt; The ""Yes West"" lineup went on to release Talk in 1994, but sales were poor, and in 1995 Rabin and Kaye left the band.  Howe and Wakeman re-joined to produce the albums Keys to Ascension in 1996 and Keys to Ascension 2 in 1997, which featured both live performances and new studio tracks, returning to their progressive style of the 1970s.  Wakeman left the band shortly thereafter due to disagreements about the albums and tour.

&gt; The band collaborated with Billy Sherwood to produce the album Open Your Eyes in 1998, and Sherwood became an official member at the end of the sessions due to his significant contributions.  Igor Khoroshev also performed on a few tracks and performed on the following tour, eventually becoming a full member as well.

&gt; Moving through the 1990s and into the new millennium, the band has moved back towards progressive influenced music and today keeps pushing the boundaries by using the latest hard-disk recording techniques.

&gt; In 1999 they worked with Relic Entertainment, providing the song ""Homeworld (The Ladder)"" for the PC game Homeworld. Although Sierra Entertainment later released a CD with the soundtrack they, for no apparent reason, chose not to include this song on the CD. It can however be found on the 1999 album The Ladder.

&gt; After the departure of Sherwood in 2000 and Khoroshev in 2001, Yes recorded Magnification in 2001 without a keyboardist, instead featuring a full orchestra.  Rick Wakeman re-joined the band the next year, and in 2003 the band recorded five tracks that were added as a 3rd CD in the compilation Ultimate Yes: 35th Anniversay Collection, including acoustic versions of ""Roundabout"" and ""South Side of the Sky"".

&gt; In 2008, when the band was about to begin their 40th anniversary tour, Jon Anderson suffered from a throat infection and was unable to participate.  Benoit David, from Canadian Progressive Rock band Mystery and Yes tribute band Close To The Edge, was recruited to fill in on vocals for the tour.  In 2009, he was named as Anderson's permanent replacement.  Rick Wakeman's son Oliver Wakeman also joined the band on keyboards.

&gt; The band recorded Fly From Here in 2011, their first new album in 10 years, with David on vocals and Trevor Horn as producer.  Before the album was completed, Wakeman was replaced by Geoff Downes, bringing together the Drama lineup and a similar sound.  The title track was originally conceived in 1981, and it was refined and extended into 20-minute six-part epic.

&gt; In February 2012, after contracting a respiratory illness, David was replaced by Glass Hammer vocalist Jon Davison who, like David, was discovered while fronting a Yes cover band.  In 2014, Yes released Heaven &amp; Earth with Davison performing vocals.

&gt; On May 19, 2015,  Chris Squire announced that he would be unable to join the band on their North American tour with Toto due to being diagnosed with Acute Erythroid Leukemia (AEL), an uncommon form of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Billy Sherwood would perform with the band in his place.

&gt; On June 28, 2015, Yes released the following announcement:

&gt; It’s with the heaviest of hearts and unbearable sadness that we must inform you of the passing of our dear friend and Yes co-founder, Chris Squire. Chris peacefully passed away last night (27 June 2015) in Phoenix, Arizona.

&gt; RIP Chris Squire 1948-2015

Cruise around back and forth, just go out with the mindset of having fun and fucking around on your board. When the weathers nice, go out and enjoy the day for a bit, take in the breeze and sun, and push around a bit. Take your board everywhere, even if you don't plan on really skating much.

And if you are having trouble balancing / staying on just cruising around, make sure you are bending your knees slightly - lowering your center of gravity will make it easier to balance. 

Another thing that helps is just balancing on your front pushing foot, make sure you are putting weight on your front foot, if you transfer too much weight to your pushing foot, you can lose balance and it feels awkward.

Silver and gold is the same. After that, its pretty much all just advancing subcategories of each broad spectrum of the game. Rotations, aerials, dribbling, offensive ball pushes(passes and shots), agility. Everything in the game falls somewhere into those 5 categories. Sure people learn big subparts of those between gold and plat, but only in those first 2 tiers do you really see an unlocking of one of those 5 branches. Aerials, rotations, and agility are the biggest 3 in my opinion. They are constantly being improved and have to be in order to stay relevant as a player. For aerials, at high plat you start to see bad redirects and double touches. At diamond you see standard, ""eh that was cool...ish"" rebounds and triple touches. Champ is when aerials get rediculous. The gap between me, a Champ 1 and a midtier GC is astounding. They hit rebounds way more consistently, they judge the ball better, they know how to angle their car to hit it juuuusst right to squeeze it top corner. Its crazy. Rotations really explode at diamond. You stop seeing the whole ""I have 1350 points and you all have 400"" thing because rotations keep everyone relevant. Platinum is a bit better than gold, especially high plat. Midtier diamond is when you start to see good, solid rotations where(most of this will be relevant to 2s) 1 person is really pushing and the other is finding a chink in the defense to either go for a demo or open up for a pass play. At champ, the game is so fluid and often times doesnt see more than 4 goals before 1 team just kinda gives up. Its just really fluid and everyone knows where to be and when. Agility is so important in Rocket League, especially in the plat area and the high diamond to all of champ. In platinum, you separate the actually good players from the people who have peaked. To be good, you need to be fast. Gold play is very clunky and slow. It takes 6 hours for someone to go up for an aerial, 4 people chase the ball at once and it just kinda goes around the map doing its thing. In plat, a fast player can control a game. Half flipping, wave dashing(wait till diamond), being decisive. These separate the diamonds from the platinums. You gotta be fast. At champ, its hard to compete if you arent fast. You dont have to play fast all the time. Dribbling is encouraged, passing plays all over the place, whatever. But you have to be able to, if need be, play fast. If the other team is fast and you dont know whats going on, yiure dead meat. And if the other team is slow and you see this and you pounce with all kinds of quick breaks and counter attacks that hit them right in the Achilles Heel, youre gonna go forward and they wont. You have to be able to go fast, slow, and accomodate for things you arent expecting.

Now onto the minor two,  dribbling and major offensive ball movements where you actually hit the ball with a purpose like shooting and passing. Now some may call me crazy for saying dribbling is nonimportant and how I must not be a 1s player if I say that. Ill admit it, I hate 1s. I suck at dribbling, I never put time into it, but look where I am. Im Diamond 1 in 3 playlists that I dont play and Im Champ 1 in 2s which I pretty much play exclusively. Can I sometimes pull off a nice flick or something special? Sure! But I dont find it to be as important to 2s or 3s as some may think. The higher the level of play, the faster it typically is. I find that its hard to find time, especially in 3s, to dribble around the field or even have time to get a few touches before they strip it or I pass it off. Its important to know your car and how the ball reacts, but not as important that you can do a musty flick or 180 flick. Call me crazy, i just dont find it as important as other skills. Now offensive attacks. Passing gets VERY important the farther you get. Solo plays wont be enough anymore. You can squeak 1 or 2 by, sure, but dont expect to carry a team. Me and my 2s teammate often find that our best games are when we have the same amount of assists as the other has goals for both of us. Getting good at putting a pass across and getting open or rotating back is extremely important and hard to practice outside of real game situations. Shooting actually falls off the radar a little. Honing your skills every couple days is important, but the difference between a platinum and a Champion is the difference in the situation they are shooting from. While the platinum finds hinself shooting from the ground a lot, I find myself shooting from the air(assuming thats at least 3/4 of the goals height) at least half the time. Shooting just becomes another part of aerials really, falling into the redirect and rebound category more often than not.

**Hero Balance and Card Changes**

It’s a bit earlier than our normal balance cadence, but for V.41 we want to make some interim changes sooner rather than later. We focus on Phase, Revenant and Morigesh, as well as a variety of bug fixes and quality of life changes to Kallari, Wukong, and Dekker.

 

But wait, there's more! We are smoothing out cards like Bounty Stalker, Portal Stone and Tainted Magick to function more in line with our other card updates.

We’ve got new Polished Novaborn Greystone and Instructor Feng Mao variations coming to Loot Creates in v.41. Check them out here: [Image](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Paragon%2Fblog%2Fv-41-release-notes%2F600x600_Loot-Bundle_v41-Misc-600x600-6c97092147f335792cddbd8c4dec5df696c46c66.jpg)

Although i'm not 100% satisfied with my 2s rank, i made some nice progress in 3s. Last season i finished in Shooting Star and was a pretty poor 3s player. Over the last weeks i made the push to Champion 1 by solo queuing, so i'm very happy with that.  
I didn't play too many 1s and Solo 3s, but they're between Diamond 1 and 2.

Obligatory Leoric [meme theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6-ZGAGcJrk).

Rexxar [meme theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jenlSf2E8o).

Sgt Hammer theme is Flight of the Valkyries [obviously](https://youtu.be/hh9rUe_JARE?t=21).

Every support in QM is represented by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa8xiDaWqpg).

But for real don't use the above. Here's the real list:

* I think Iron Maiden suits Falstad. Something like [Losfer Words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kLafYgKCTU)(instrumental only) or [Aces High](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HukVeVBva2k) or [Run To The Hills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZlDZPYzfm4). Aces High especially if you're going for music that is about something related to the character.

* Diablo could also use [Iron Maiden - Number of the Beast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-iRf9AWoyE) if you want character describing music.

* Li Ming feels like an electronic sort of character, but a faster kind like some variant of Drum n Bass. [Matrix &amp; Futurebound - Magnetic Eyes \(feat. Baby Blue\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnD99FSYD30) and [LAOS - Back No More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g477J651Mo) are nice because women singers feel like they suit her a bit more. Also a lot of the stuff by Pendulum like [9000 Miles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTXFAZwoCi8) (long buildup) are good but usually not the same tempo. Though I think Li Ming would probably listen to KPop or something similar if it were up to her.

* D.Va should be something KPop. Or something Mecha Anime like [Evangelion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU2bF2-Gwdw), [Gundam 08th MS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PKgztP0zw), or [Getter Robo Armageddon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pYduET6PwI) (maybe too manly).

* Genji's theme is obviously [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3472Q6kvg0), though [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RlSgnpLbro) from the same game actually suits his story.

* For Kerrigan; I've always liked [Rock Queen - Future In My Hands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SOm82nXdr0) in my fast rock playlist for all carries but it actually suits her character post infestation. Or you could go classic and literal with [David Bowie  ;_;7 - Space Oddity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYMCLz5PQVw) except instead of Major Tom going crazy it would be Ground Control that went crazy.

* I think Raynor would suit a lot of classic rock like Led Zeppelin, The Who, maybe Aerosmith, but especially Lynyrd Skynyrd.

* Zagara would definitely be Nujabes, maybe Dehaka too. [The Space Between Two Worlds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUGEdttx04k), [Arurian Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9hwjQBQFIo), and [World Without Words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuKcl8e_7J0) are totally ""minding my own business split pushing and being a zerg"" feeling.

* Chen could be [Spirit of the West - Home For A Rest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crIk87-mPzY) or [Flogging Molly - Drunken Lullabies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89NjEeHku8o), as cheesy as that is, they're both fast and fun enough to play to.

* Artanis feels like a [Digitalism - Miami Showdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfMdV-SE2bs) kind of guy.

I think Illidan players must have Dope - Die Motherfucker Die playing on repeat which explains why they tunnel vision so hard. Brightwing might also have it stuck in her head. Please don't include this one though, it's awful.

* But actually I feel Illidan suits [Rise Against - Give It All](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhldbymXK-8) gameplay wise and current story wise, or [Savior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtKy8tj5kzk) for his pre-death story, though I doubt these will be very popular songs.

* Nazeebo suits [Chemical Brothers - Escape 700 (Hanna OST)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqKnoXXL-yI) for more split push shenanigans.

* Li Li feels like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHozn0YXAeE) which is surprisingly fun to play games to once in a while. Not even kidding.

* Jaina's character suits [Persona 4 - Heartbeat, Heartbreak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9dZeXv6EdY) I think. It sounds lovely and happy but the lyrics are so sad.

* Lucio should have something Deadmau5 because tributes.

* Xul and Leoric feel like The Misfits kind of characters because death and monster related lyrics and look at Xul's fist pumping when he wins games; he's totally into this music. Maybe American Psycho, Speak of the Devil (catchy af chorus melody), Dig Up Her Bones, or Halloween.

* Also Malthael with [Misfits - Astro Zombies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZJPPOLBDcc) because the lyrics somewhat suit him if you change alien to death incarnate.

* Varian suits the lyrics of [Stan SB - Throne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0J1_9Au_EwI) (that's the best quality recording out there) but I don't really think the music style does.

If you don't have a skatepark near you, or you feel a little intimidated to go to one (I totally understand that, I know i am, but I've started going finally!), then look for a basketball or tennis court, that's where I started.  And if you want to know how to even go about learnig to skate, I've been going along with Skateboarding made Simple by Aaron Kyro of Braille Skateboarding.  Here's their Youtube Learn to Skateboard playlist:

I bought SMS on Google Play, you get more in it, but it costs money.  Basically, he has a progression that helps: Start with getting comfortable on the board pushing, carving turns, kickturns, stopping, that kind of thing.  Then ollies, frontside 180's, backside 180's, shuvits, pop shuvits, heelflips, kickflips.  I got up to frontside 180's, then realized I could barely ollie while rolling, so went back and worked on that, but then i went to the skatepark, and I've been playing on the transitions a little, learning how to kickturn on them and drop in, it's fun!  Sorry if it feels like I'm pimping my own YouTube channel, but I've been recording and posting videos of my practice sessions, helps keep me motivated, and hopefully can help motivate and encourage others like yourself if they see a 43 year old dude out there learning and falling and having a good ol' time!

The first think that happened was me adding some 300 songs individually by pressing the heart. Only later did I found out that they don't collect the hearted songs to any playlist. For that I had to go into a sub menu and push a plus button that always gave a small animation, making every click take 8+ seconds, add in some odd lag and the process took waaay to long. Then my phone got smashed and I had to get a new one and... every song was gone. I found dozens of stupid decisions that all taken together made my blood boil.

Compared to the other Brooklyn Steel shows I've attended, this one was a tad bit rowdier and dare I say younger? I noticed (and evidently James noticed as well based on his comments tonight) kids dancing/mashing with their elbows out, lots of video recording phones, and generally overzealous crowd (one guy just kept forcefully pushing phones down--James appreciated the sentiment but asked him to stop doing that). I admire the energy! Though I could tell some folks around us were getting perturbed. 

Nancy looked lovely in green. Gavin still looks like he's a polish mother hanging her laundry in 1934 Brooklyn. Compared to other shows, band was noticeably less playful (they're probably tired). 

As mentioned before, Yr City's a Sucker was a welcomed addition. Have only heard it once before, but this time it was timed with the disco ball which added an epic flair to it. Yeah was off the playlist again, much to the chagrin of many people around me. My hope is that the future tour includes it--I would rather sacrifice Movement or I Can Change to make room for that barn burner. 

I got to hear Change Yr Mind! I'm very happy about that. Jungle bass line backed by a sequencer similar to Tonite and accompanied with a palm muted rhythm on Al's guitar. There was also a screening sound throughout that sounded like a bird. First impressions is that it reminds me of Suicide (particularly Ghost Rider) combined with Too Much Love (specifically the ""with no memories to keep you up at night"" part). It's definitely not a ""monolith"" as Al had described, but it definitely adds some layers to their already stacked catalog. Some lyrics i picked up on were ""it's impossible..."", ""I'm just too old for it now,"" ""seems to be true...thoughts keep them to yourself,"" and of course ""if you change yr mind"" 

Ok goodnight all

You said the kid you're taking care of is annoying. If you plan to continue on with this job for awhile longer, there's things you can keep in mind to make the job not so taxing. I'm not going to go in depth on this because that would take too long and I don't feel I explain these things as well as the people on YouTube that I'll recommend to you.

Basically, practice leaning into your feelings. If you feel annoyed with this kid because he/she is bothering you in some way, accept that feeling. It wouldn't be wise to act on it, to take it out on him/her. Though just don't resist these feelings. Resisting what society labels has negative feelings will only intensify them. You can overcome these feelings in healthy ways. Practice mindfulness and experiencing your feelings without resistance. This is a true sign of strength. Even though it may be easier than other things that you have done, doing this will make your life much better. Please give it a shot before turning it down. I know self-help really push meditating and mindfulness and it probably seems like a cliché by now, but I can tell you I've found certain forms of meditation and mindfulness that have had and continue to have a greatly positive impact on my life.

If you want to get intellectual about mindfulness and know with certainty that what you're doing is the right thing, look up Alan Watts on YouTube. Here's a playlist of my favorite Alan Watts pieces on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7e1dTEeQ0WFyr4dsJy3fwNzsJhugMCJb

If you want to get right to the point and practice meditating and mindfulness check out Miracle Forest's guided meditations.

That's just the tip of the iceburg for me. A big factor is how they push public playlists.

People get on there and think they're fucking DJs. Fucking idiots don't know how music flows. Not gonna lie, I get really triggered at that.

What's most important is how you know how to use lines, shapes and perspective. Say you want to later learn anatomy, you can't do that without knowing how to set cubes in perspective. You actually can't do anything advanced if you don't know the aforementioned.

But even before lines shapes and perspective it's important to know how to sketch. 
it's important to keep things light, if you really push on the paper too hard try a very soft pencil, here is a [list](http://www.incredibleart.org/lessons/elem/images/gradation.jpg) that might help figure that out. Also try a top grip instead of the normal grip, D and E as shown here (http://www.scielo.br/img/revistas/jped/v85n4/en_4a13f2en.jpg), this forces you to use your elbow and arm and not your fingers and wrists.

After having that all down, try looking for fundamental books. You can find loads online, legal and illegal. You can use this in combination with various youtube videos. Here is a whole [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1HIh25sbqZnkA1T09UtVHoyjYaMJuK0a) of them.

I do agree Drake is more popstar now than anything but he's still a hip-hop icon and he still raps a lot (I wish he'd rap a lot more however). He's not much of a genre pusher or experimenter, but he definitely brings many new sounds into the mainstream. I agree with your previous comment of More Life sounding like a bunch of B-sides but that's why it was released as a ""playlist"" whatever tf that means to avoid people expecting a cohesive album. But I think it further showcases his talent in both singing, rapping, and having an original sound (Passionfruit, Gyalchester (my favorite on More Life), Sacrifices, Portland all have varied sounds and are still well done).

Just put on something you haven't heard before when you're driving, or like a spotify discover playlist. Rate those things so it'll curate better.

* Write a hit

* release your song with a music video, push for shares to gather awareness in your local music scene. Co-ordinate with online blogs to announce your release with a press kit you give them. This often includes an article you've written that they can publish.

* Get on radio stations, if the song is good enough this shouldn't be a problem. Music is often decided by the music director

* Spotify watch radio charts, if your song is doing well it should ideally chart high enough that Spotify will add you onto their official playlists. This builds social proof, meaning you're more easily able to convince people you're a band worth paying attention to

* this will gather thousands of plays online if you get onto these play lists. Eventually hundreds of thousands.

* Use your charting and plays to show promoters that you're relevant. This part is important, promoters of festivals and large scale tours often don't need to see that your music is awesome, they need to see that you're relevant and have gathered a following that will buy tickets

* Tour on the back of your single, and support larger tours / festivals. This is easier once you're relevant.

You need to find a way to 'exist', this is called building 'profile'

This happened with our debut single, before it came out nobody knew who we were and we had a very small following to sell to. Our following was gathered from radio play and touring with big bands / playing to large audiences.

You clearly haven't played any good Bull users. Also, I'm pretty sure there is some form of trophy based match making, but you often get matched out of your trophy range due to there being so many playlists, and so few users. You may also be playing with team mates who have a low trophy count/high trophy count and against a high trophy player with a low trophy team mate which can throw the algorithm off. I'm pretty sure the algorithm was confirmed by a youtuber I want to say?

I did manage to get LibreElec working but there were some hangups and issues. I'm going to post an ELI5 version of what I did to get it working.

Installation media had to be created on my desktop, which currently has no working speakers, which is why I'm not using it instead of my HTPC. 

I tried using their Live USB binary but it couldn't find my USB stick. A check of the LibreElec forums had no information on a workaround, so I downloaded the image and pushed it to the USB using Rufus, DD Image option.

Once USB media was inserted to the Revo I had to press F12 to force it to boot from USB. Installation went smoothly but there were still the issues with overscan and no audio.

Overscan was fixed by going to settings -&gt; system settings -&gt; Click ""Basic mode"" 2x to get to ""Expert mode"" -&gt; Video calibration.

This video calibration screen is supposed to have handles in the top left and bottom right corners of the screen that you can click &amp; drag to resize the display. In my case the handles were **completely off the edge of the screen** so I didn't see them on my first two trips into video calibration. I finally reached around into the area off the screen and found them, dragging them in to where they were fully visible.

Sound was solved by going into System Settings -&gt; Audio and switching output source from NVIDIA analog to NVIDIA HDMI.

You cannot actually get out of Kodi in this distro. It's JUST Kodi. To view Youtube you have to install an add-on. Addons -&gt; Download -&gt; Video Addons -&gt; Youtube. (Note that it's easier to use a remote control than a mouse - my mouse's scroll wheel was way oversensitive.)

If you are using playlists in the Youtube addon and want to autoadvance, you need to then put down the remote, use the mouse to right click on the video you want to start with, and select either 'Play from here' or 'Play all.' I haven't seen yet if the Youtube addon has ads or blocks them. Will find out eventually I'm sure.

Haven't figured out yet how to get a uBlock compatible browser addon installed, but /u/NedSc says below that it's possible so if I do start getting ads I'll try that route instead. (I know, I know, ads help the creators, but when you're trying to keep a consistent BPM and can't hold the remote on your person it's rough to get a 3 minute long ad.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6iynvt,,,,,,,,,,,1498256856.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499608625.0,,,

I would say the biggest factor for me personally was my mindset when playing. Some days I played great, while other days I played terribly. It was important to recognize the days I was off and stop playing before I got tilted and lost even more ranked points. I would like to say that I don't get mad about teammates and everything is okay, however it's hard to stay calm when you lose an 8 minute overtime because of a stupid mistake on your behalf. Even if I think I'm okay, I may start rushing more than usual or not trusting my teammate as much which can screw the rotations. 

I always play with a friend nowadays. It's good to play with people you're familiar with so that you know their play styles and can predict what they would do even before they tell you over voice comms. 

I've had multiple runs from platinum 3 division 4 back down to division 1 and back up to division 4. One day we just clicked and we're we're working well together. We pushed a six game win streak and got me to diamond 1 while my friend got back to diamond 2 in doubles. 

Even though there isn't a ton of time left, I would recommend to realize when you're not playing your best and opt out for a break from the game so you don't lose more points. Maybe come back in an hour and just watch previous replays of random games you've saved from your teammates perspective, that always helped me notice inconsistencies and flaws with my gameplay. 

As for my playstyle I'm definitely more defensive since my teammate is more offensive. Sometimes he would try to go for crazy aerials or angles on shots that I wouldn't dare take. But you know sometimes it works out for him and he gets results that I would never get if I was in that situation. So I try to play the midfield until I'm sure of a goal or try to dribble and slow the ball down for a flick past the defense. I noticed after watching my replays that I was too hesitant in certain situations and if I was a bit more aggressive I could challenge for favorable 50/50s instead of being afraid and going back to defense. 

So overall if you're trying to get to the next rank in general, realize when you're playing badly and take breaks, watch past replays from other perspectives to see your flaws, and try to recognize what you need to change in order to improve to make the leap. 

Whenever I worried about my rank we seemed to lose more than we won. When I was having fun talking to my teammate more than just the game, it seemed like we were winning more than we were losing. I'd chalk it up to my mentality and not feeling the pressure of having to win every game. ",,,,diamond1,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6j2x1x,,,,,,,,,Diamond I,,1498252176.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499606574.0,,,

For example: I visit my mom in England twice a year. The night before my early morning flights I can never sleep, so I end up sitting in the main room from around 11pm-4:30am. Since I'm making a long trip I will have already downloaded all the recent youtube videos and shows I want to watch, so I just kinda brows. Well, a few months ago I was doing this and came across ""Moon Hooch"" (now that I think of it, thanks reddit! It was because someone got a post to the front page about Moon Hooches video where they act as a human alarm clock for the people who let them crash on their couch.) that lead me to find ""Too Many Zooz"" and finally (my new personal favorite) ""Lucky Chops"" all three of which have been played daily during my smoke sessions or commute.

Its generally in a moment of pure boredom where I just begin clicking random stuff. Just last week i listened to the Chinese rap group the ""Higher Brothers"" for the first time because I had seen some Instagram picture of Lil Yachty watching their video, so I figured why not check them out. Despite not knowing most of what they are rapping about, me and my other friends cant stop blasting them. 

In my opinion, the best way to find is to not look. Just naturally roll in to stuff. If you push yourself too hard, you may not like it just because it's not the right time. I tried to force myself to listen to ""Pink Floyd"" multiple times with no luck as a teen. Then a few months ago I drop some acid, and a five hour psychedelic visuals playlist with their music comes up. Best five hours of my life.

I am not great at dribbling, I still FeelsBackFlipMan from time to time, I can’t air dribble, my high aerials don’t have great accuracy or power, and my wall hits often leave something to be desired.
 
That being said, here are the main things (in approximate order of importance) I worked on that helped push me into Diamond last week!
 
 
- I was critical of myself (Both in game and watching my replays) to identify my main weaknesses. Some were obvious to see and work on (half flips, dribbling), but others were much more subtle (I hesitated on some shots and missed scoring opportunities, too often my saves would either be weak saves or clear to the middle of the field instead of the corner which gave my opponents another easy shot). Once identified, it’s usually easy to work on it in training/unranked. This grew a TON of my skills, but the final one before getting into diamond was wall clears/passes.
 
- I got MUCH more consistent and powerful with the common passes/shots/saves, mostly by grinding custom training/unranked. This usually led to an extra point for my team every other game or so simply by not missing an open net or by making a weak clear/hit.
 
- I got better at setting up passes a variety of ways instead of the classic roll/hit to the corner: Following the ball up the corner for a second touch, Aerial hit onto the backboard/midfield, cutting the ball into the midfield with a chip shot, getting a quick dribble flick, etc.
 
- I got better on offense at recognizing when the opponent would have an easy clear and I should position defensively or when the opponent might not clear it well and I should position more aggressively for a shot or easy rebound shot.
 
- I played 3v3 more often, a playlist which accentuates my strengths (teamplay, passes, rotations) and hides my weaknesses (hesitation, dribbling, solo plays). There’s a lot less time for solo plays/dribbles, and I hesitated less because there’s less punishment if you miss an aerial/shot/wall hit, as you have two teammates to still back you up.

that said, i still think that the skinner box stuff would have worked if 343 didnt feel the need to push it so hard (really, the playlist menu always had infinity modes first), in the end it became basically just team fiesta only people actually choose their weapons once everyone unlocked everything. then there is the fact that the DMR and BR are basically the same weapon once they got patched, which seeing how no other weapon had anything like weapon variations (which is one of the few things halo 5 does right) it just seemed like it was there to make it seem like the weapon list was big enough to justify loadouts. also, CTF on big maps lost all of its tense moments due to the game allowing you to use the magnum while carrying the flag, which made team work much less fun since it wasnt like the rest of a team was helping a VIP, if anything is more like team slayer on bungie's games only instead of power weapons to you had the flag.

btw, really enjoying this discussion, im never able to discuss halo with anyone because my friends dont play it :P",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6iohj0,,,,,,,,,,,1498239995.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499600927.0,,,

t5_2rh4c,,,,False,,,,,,,hiphopheads,,,,,,djai9a9,,,0,,,,jahrastajedi,,,t3_6iyjj0,13,,,,,,"Gonna do a live listen opinion. Already gave it a first listen and I thought it was straight trash. So thought id listen again and just write how I feel listening to the songs. 

1. If you fuck with Sizzla the first song is a vibe until DJ Khaled comes and ruins it.

2. Shining has been out for a while and I still dont really fuck with it. Too much change up and I’ve just not been fucking with Hov's music since Blueprint 3. 

3. To The Max has been removed from the album outside of the US. Thank fuck cuz it would have made this trash album even more trash.

4. Wild Thoughts prob best song of the album. He sampled Maria Maria got PND to write &amp; Rihanna and Tiller to sing. That deserves a grammy tbh.

5. I fuck with I’m the One only cuz I really miss Wayne and I eat when he releases new stuff. This song is really just for pop culture getting Chance, Quavo and Bieber on the hook. 

6. Dont really have much to say about On Everything. As soon as it started I wanted to skip. Ross was okay, Sean was better. Travis trash.

7. Back to back Trash hooks for travis. This has to be the worst combo ever. Putting Nas verses between these trash hooks. Smh Khaled.

8. Betty Wright is a queen. Not sure I have anything else to say about that.

9. Nobody isnt as bad as on second listen but maybe cuz Alicia Keys sing good. That Nicki Verse was pretty shocking.

10. Finally reached the Chance song. I actually wanna pull up on Khaled and ask him how he could possibly get Chance to make such a trash song. He gets chance to sing the ABC's goddamn bruh. How the fuck is this song 5 minutes long. Worst song on the album for me. 

11. The Dont Quit beat is a vibe. This is better from Travis. Fuck with this song, will probably be in rotation for a month at least. (On a side note: kind of looking forward to the Travis feature on Calvin Harris new digs. His part in Know No Better and the other Calvin songs released have me hyped). 

12. I Can't Even Lie is actually wavy. Only thing I have against it is that future spells out B-A-B-Y. Even Nicki verse fire. A little too much 'bitch' but still vybz.

13. I fuck with the PND hook on Down For Life. Still dont know why Future spelling out shit. Sound whack to me. Ross kills it, his part is short but this song too long. Also, I dont know what it is, but I cant stand Kodak's voice. 

14. Some of the hooks have been too long for me. Major Bag Alert another one for me. Would have preferred a Quavo verse. Offset goes in and so does Takeoff. Can't find many flaws in the song but I still dont fuck with it and I fuck with Migos hard. Quavo a real superstar. 

15. Wild Thoughts &amp; Good Man are probably the best takeaways from this album. Push and Kiss on the same track spitting bars. Pusha asks Khaled not to pair him or compare him unless its a rare breed, so Khaled gives him Jadakiss. Thank you Khaled.

16. Really feelin this Isley Brothers sample on Billy Ocean. Just not really fucking with Fat Joe. Chef flowing nice quite like his verse.

17. Even though I am not a big Kodak fan, Pull a Caper starts well with his hook and the Gucci verse real smooth. Dont think Ross fits here tbh, he doesnt have a bad verse but I feel a vibe change when he comes on. 

18. That Range Rover Came With Steps is hard. Future and Gotti spitting bars on a fairly minimilistic beat. Doubt this gonna be in rotation tho, cant really catch a vibe just straight bars.

19. Not really a fan of the Future hook on Iced Out My Arms and I would really have liked more Quavo on Migos verse. 21 &amp; TIP kill this song. This beat is really fire though. (Side Note: Does T.I. come in anyones Top 10 DOA? Man constantly makes hits and bangers but seems to never be in consideration). 

20. When I first saw the tracklist was looking at Whatever to be a guaranteed banger. Unfortunately this is quite disappointing. The album started with trash Travis hooks and seems to be ending with trash Future hooks. Was also hoping for EBBTG Thugger on this but got some SS1 thugger. 

21. This Belly interlude is actually one of the better songs on this album. Is Belly slept on? Man makes really good music. Seriously though, Khaled would have been better off making a 23 track album with more one verse Interludes like this. Better than making a mess out of all the songs by stacking big name features. 

22. I must be high. I have not heard Khaled’s voice since the beginning of Whatever. This Mavado song a good vibe though. Will be going on my wind down playlist no doubt. 

23. Instant classic. 

I only really fuck with 4 songs out of 23. Was hoping for much better. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6iyjj0,,,,,,,,,,,1498216173.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499591874.0,,,

Second... there are actually a lot of things keeping me motivated this time around. The biggest (and by far the nerdiest) is a cosplay I'm currently working on. We'll be going to EGX in September and I'm working on a Cora Harper cosplay from Mass Effect: Andromeda. It's kind of slow going as I haven't been sewing consistently in a while, but I think we'll get there! 

A little bit before that, we'll be going on our first trip back to the USA since moving across the pond. We're spending a week each in NV and MI with each of our families and it also falls over not only my birthday, but my nursing school bff's birthday as well. I'm just SO looking forward to running around in summer clothes feeling confident and badass. My little brother has also been working out quite a bit recently, and in the interest of sibling rivalry AND camaraderie, I think it'll be a blast to both be rolling around our hometown way more fit than when we left.

In the beginning, there was [disco.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfHjoqo7ANU ""Let No Man Put Asunder"") Disco gave rise to [techno](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiCEGXGm-z0 ""Strings of Life"") and [house](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUDWbTJiclI ""Can You Feel It"") in the late 1980's, in Chicago and Detroit. House and techno quickly spread to [the UK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLxDRePUwEY ""Pacific State"") and [NYC.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALsHox5sYCk ""Energy Flash"") Within a few years, NYC and London had become the dipoles of the global rave axis, and in London, house and techno, with the influence of hip hop and dub music, morphed into [jungle.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5w63kym-45E ""Narra Mine"") 

Also centered in London, the music moved in other new directions, like [ambient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHixChYgGRI ""Little Fluffy Clouds"") and [trance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM5q1o7ofnc ""For An Angel"") (also known as [progressive house](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTFrCbQGyvM ""Born Slippy"") when it's slowed down a little bit).  Meanwhile jungle soon evolved into [drum &amp; bass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Obv477QfDI0 ""Circles"") which then gave rise to [techstep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg2aTcWQEx8 ""Funktion"") and [jump-up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hJ4OROIvxY ""Warhead"") and various other subgenres. 

When jungle was slowed down a little bit, it became known as [breakbeat.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2blsHcPj6s ""EP 1 A2"") The jungle/hip hop influence also gave rise to a slower sound that was first known as [triphop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Epgo8ixX6Wo ""Protection"") but eventually was just called [downtempo.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4E60Ffa9yQ ""Organ Donor"") 

By the late '90s there was a lot of cross-pollination between genres, and house with a strong d&amp;b influence birthed a style that was originally known as [""speed garage""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYWYDJNzPCw ""Sugar Is Sweeter Remix"") but soon was labelled [UK garage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHPp2JvRY-o ""RIP Groove"") (the original [garage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yK5V7czvpXE ""Don't Make Me Wait"") style came out of NYC between disco and house, and it was named after a gay club called the Paradise Garage, just like house was named after Chicago gay club the Warehouse). Another style of house known as [deep house](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5vnIX1niDQ ""House Music"") had its first big revival around this time, although it had been around since almost the beginning of house.

Throughout this time ambient had also become more and more eclectic, to where the category was so broad it could mean almost anything, but generally implied the music had a laidback vibe. Good examples are [Aphex Twin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AWIqXzvX-U ""Rhubarb"") and [Biosphere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_QoIvnkN7w ""Hyperborea"") and [Stars of the Lid.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZ60j24Tr2M ""Requiem for Dying Mothers"") 
____

Post-2000:

[2-step garage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02KRAshCG0w ""Sincere"") came out of UK garage. The styles mutated, and when MCs were added, [grime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8zbaIo3ZEw ""Stormy Weather"") was formed. Further mutation led to the nascent [dubstep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDU1Cy152S4 ""Midnight Request Line"") sound. This was all established by 2003 or so, it's also worth mentioning that almost all of these UK styles from jungle to d&amp;b to garage to grime to dubstep owe a lot to London's [pirate radio stations.](http://rinse.fm/) 

Meanwhile Berlin had become a new capital for the techno sound, and before long transplants like Richie Hawtin and others had created a new style known as [minimal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2lt3bitHkQ ""Orange Mistake"")  Soon everyone was really fucking sick of minimal, house was rediscovered yet again, and [tech house](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaQV7UhYAM0 ""Sandcastles"") had a big resurgence. 

At the same time in NYC rock and roll was refusing to die and indie seemed actually to be bigger than ever. As tired as the whole rock schtick had become, some inventive house-heads realized that they could take a little bit of that and a little bit of this and a little bit of E and they came up with a fairly innovative style of [""dance punk""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7u3Po15_L8 ""Casual Friday"") or whatever the fuck you call it, which is also related to [electroclash.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTYJZtnUuF0 ""Rippin Kittin"") 

Straight [disco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36yymtzpbpk ""Backwards Is The Best Way Forward"") also made a comeback when all the hipsters realized where all the dance music first came from. And from electroclash, the [electro house](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cnY9KXF14g ""Kinda New (Dub)"") sound became very popular. In a similar direction, [a more rocking French take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD4XqUzeJXA ""Fast Track/Never Be Alone"") on this style also got big. Eventually in order to make it seem like they weren't just reliving the glory days of Studio 54 and the Loft, artists took to making [edits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvFcCGnvH38 ""Skylarking (Caribbean Sunrise Rework)"") of classics from disco and other genres.

On the London front, true dubstep and garage were being pushed out by the massive popularity of brostep, and those styles got [weirder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hTN19x1DyM ""Maybes"") and [harder to define,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Q4Jrom7-J4 ""Heard That"") until eventually everyone said ""screw it, we'll just call it all [bass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znMKJELCXN4 ""Too Polite"") [music.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmHWC4O1azk ""Sicko Cell"") Drum &amp; bass also felt the dubstep/garage influence and got similarly [weird,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AnyCPvYg9s ""Watching You"") but [deep house](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eik39PmTDe0 ""Sing (FP Remix)"") and [tech house](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9yemsWxeJ8 ""OAR003-B"") were bigger than ever. 

These days it seems like most of the original dubstep/bass artists who aren't just resting on their laurels are once again exploring the music's roots in techno, deep house, and disco.  

Also I'd highly recommend the documentary [Pump Up The Volume](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1HpY65cXDA) and the classic book Energy Flash (formerly known as Generation Ecstasy) for strong histories of this era.

In fact, only two posts say anything in the song is bad, with one mentioning the transitions while another mentions the synths sounding dated. I won't claim expertise on transitions because that would be dumb, but I personally didn't like them either. I will claim moderate expertise on synths, and say that they are dated, and for someone into synthesizers, boring.

Some people obviously don't care if music pushes boundaries or tries new things, and there is nothing wrong with that. If innovation actually mattered in whether a song was good or not, we wouldn't have mashups on youtube showing the same chord progression in 100 popular songs. However, some people do get tired of hearing songs that play it safe, and there's nothing wrong with that either.

Personally, I don't care much either way. I don't care if it sounds like 2ne1 because I've never listened to them. I love summer pop songs. I don't care if it follows the standard pop song formula, my band's more popular songs do too. 

As someone who is into the technical aspects of music, I'm still hugely disappointed in this song, not because it's bad, but because I expect more from BP. The production on the first four BP songs is ridiculously good, with interesting and creative sound combinations, a lot of dynamic depth, etc. Pretty much the same reason ikon's new songs fell flat for me. This song is really good, and it will absolutely make my main playlist, but I doubt I'll be going back and listening 10 times in a row like with Playing With Fire.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6iyu8s,,,,,,,,,,,1498195777.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499587860.0,,,

You should absolutely have a 3-D printer, dont skimp though, the Lulzbot Taz 6 is a perfect printer, it costs $2500 though, might be worth it if you dont have one.

Pair this with TinkerCAD a free online 3-D modeling program and you can print what you want. This is free btw.

For the smaller kids they can learn logic, you can build programming skills this way. For instance an algorithm is just a set of instructions we give a computer. Well simply put youre giving the PC a list of what to do. Move right, move up, light up etc.

If there is a middle school tech program coordinate with them to build skills so they are ready for middle school tech.

Chance's big debut into the mainstream was given to him on a platter by Obama's including Acid Rain on his Summer Playlist before Coloring Book came out. That didn't happen organically, Obama *knew Chance personally*, and Obama knew damn well what that inclusion would do to his career. 

When Coloring Book came out, Obama and his kids all played it a ton (publicly). Those little things pushed Chance in a way no independent could possibly do himself. Chance without Obama would not have won a Grammy.

Chance came from an upper-middle-class family, had most everything handed to him, and he got to do what he wanted. That alone is more privilege than most rappers will ever get. Again: Dude put in work, he's a good man, and he deserves respect.

#The Only Trance Era (1-3)

Personally, I think it's 1,3,2 in that order. At the time these came out, I think that was the general consensus as well. The first is a masterpiece that was hard to top, and 3 edges out 2.

This era was classified by only using trance songs from the time.

#The Double Disc Era (4-7)

I'd probably go 4,7,5,6. It's so difficult though for some of these. In all honesty, it's almost better to talk about discs separately. Albums like Disc 2 for ISOS7, to me, was a masterpiece of mixing without any vocal tracks (sort of rare during this era).

From my understanding at least on this subreddit, I may be in the minority thinking 7&gt;6, but I still stand by it.

This era was not just classified by the double disc introduction, but also by addition of progressive house tracks into the mixes.

#The Durand Era (8-13.5)

8, 9, 11 (Myon &amp; Shane54 mix was superb if you enjoy their style),12,13 (lol BT's mix),10 (lol CD3 ""classic mix"").

I'll be honest here. I think Durand's best works were probably the first two ISOS compilations he pushed out. But they still both pale in comparison to anything that Tiesto tocuhed.  Tiesto just had that knack of developing a journey, using songs that weren't necessarily club or mega-hits. Durand just does not have that same eye for songs and setlist.

I also think that as the compilations entered the ""let's add big room sounds to trance"" era, he introduced that as well into the mix. And, to me, a sunrise mix shouldn't even have anything remotely close to that in the playlist. 

I do appreciate the guest mixes...I think that's an interesting idea. Personally, while it's more house than trance, I really enjoyed M&amp;S54's mix. You have to appreciate their style of song selection, mixing, and mashups, but they did a solid mix. Personally, while it would be a huge shift from Tiesto's ISOS sound, I honestly wouldn't have minded Myon &amp; Shane54 taking over the ISOS series instead of Durand. They know how to do their style of summer sounds, especially when it comes to their remixes (Summer of Love) and good mashups (both in mega-mixes and normal).

BT's mix was bad, especially considering his ability as a producer.

The ISOS 10 guest mix was the user-submitted contest entry for using best of ISOS tracks historically. Not only was the mixing bad, the progression was whack, and the song selection pretty much ignored the first 3 ISOS albums, which historically have been considered the top tier.

Anyway, this era is basically Durand's era, and despite listening to all the mixes multiple times, there have only been pockets of songs that I still remember to this day. Contrast that to Tiesto's albums, which I can practically play in my head.",,,,us,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6ip5hm,,,,,,,,,Secret Top 40 Fan,,1498084240.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499548461.0,,,

As for competition with RLCS, they are likely coordinating with Psyonix themselves and I have full confidence in Psyonix to help NBC pull this off superbly.

Why not push more 2's in the competitive scene? Its something that a lot of people have been waiting for and could help in expanding a viewer base. I could see it becoming a problem with roster shuffling/org contracts, but I wouldn't be surprised if it never becomes an issue.

Yeah, it can kinda bring new people in, but that's not really it's primary purpose. It's best for keeping existing fans engaged. Boost important posts to make sure your fans see them. After that, the engagement depends on the quality of the post.
If you just want Page Likes, you're better off finding another band or artist in your scene and trading Likes with them. You invite your friends to like their page and vice versa. This will be far more effective and it's free.

So you want people to hear your music. I wouldn't suggest using Fiverr or a service like that. The views will be fake most of the time and really, you're trying to cultivate real fans not just views. If 1000 people played it and didn't like it or weren't even real in the first place then what was the point? A bot's not gonna come to your show and buy your shirt and vinyl.

I would put time and money into Spotify and YouTube since not only are there massive audiences looking for new music but they are both monetizable.

Remember that Spotify crawls Hype Machine as part of its algorithm to push new music into playlists, so I would use SubmitHub and target Hype Machine listed blogs. Throw $30 in it for premium credits to start. Seek out as much blog coverage as you can. At the end of the day, the only thing social media numbers indicate is how good you are at social media, not how successful you are.

I do want to explain some of my thoughts on Halo 5 though just for kicks, because I think about this from time to time. Here's my theory: There is a fairly large group of fans of OG Halo who've been frustrated since the Bungie days ended. Since 343i took over - the general vibe is that they've taken a solid franchise and pushed out games that lack the true Halo look/feel. There are a ton of reasons why people don't like the 343i releases, but basically Bungie = good, 343i = bad in the collective mindset of this group. 

Leading up to Halo 5, these people were already expecting the game to suck (due to the drop in quality after H3/ODST), and I think a lot of the same people even wanted it to bomb - if only to spite the developers for previous failings. So Halo 5 comes out - the same people read about some of the new features and the lack of hallmark halo elements (split-screen) and they write it off.

I personally agree that 343i mishandled the visuals and many gameplay features in Halo 5, I can understand just about every complaint that I see about the direction that 343i took Halo in. However, I think that if you play this game with an open mind, and look at how 343i handled this community during the time since Halo 5's release - you will find good reason to be an excited Halo fan again. 

343i really nailed the multiplayer on this game. I have to commend them for the routine free DLC, featured multiplayer playlists, patches/updates - I think they must actually care about the community after playing this game for over a year. I will say I am not a big fan of the microtransactions - but since they give players reasonable means to unlock the crap just by playing the game, I generally give them a pass there. 

Some may disagree with me here, but this is the best Halo multiplayer since Halo 3. I feel like this is almost a hidden gem that more fans should experience. I can't say the same about the campaign - but I think that 343i has been very attentive to how this past campaign was received, and I would bet that they want to find a more true-to-form story for Halo 6 as much as everyone else. 

Basically, there are a lot of minor issues a Halo fan might have with Halo 5 - but if you are able to see past those issues I think you'll find a game that might just prove to be the foundation 343i will build upon to bring the next series of Halo games back to being the amazing, hype-inducing blockbusters we all hope they'll be.

Also, just want to say i'm not a 343i shill, I low-key hated them for a while - I am just at a point where I am looking at the whole situation in a glass half-full way. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6igx1c,,,,,,,,,,,1498012490.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499524051.0,,,

Plus, it's hard to know what kinds of songs to choose for it if I don't know your current or past musical interests. Anyway, here are my top 10 songs to introduce people to country music. Most of them are the songs that turned my head when I started paying attention to it:

If I was making this a proper mix or a playlist, I'd title it [""Both Kinds of Music.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSZfUnCK5qk)

* Hank Williams - [You Win Again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvYDQBIokz0). This was one of the first country songs I heard that I actually liked. I like the simple emotion of the lyrics. I like the fact that it's a song that's pushing 70 years old, and it still resonates because it's about a universal human experience - feeling out of control because you're so tied to your SO. Plus, Hank is the undisputed king of country music.   

* Johnny Cash - [Folsom Prison Blues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDktBZzQIiU). Johnny Cash is up there with Hank in terms of country music royalty, and this is one of his signature tracks. It's got an absolutely killer lyric - ""When I was a baby, my mama told me 'Son, always be a good boy and don't ever play with guns.' But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die."" That's a badass thing to say.  

* Willie Nelson - [Can I Sleep In Your Arms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHj2HaUeYGI). This isn't one of the tunes that would likely make it on a ""greatest hits"" compilation, but it's an absolutely arresting track from maybe one of the top 5 country albums ever made - ""Red Headed Stranger."" You really should spend some alone time with that whole album. Get a solid pair of headphones, a few beers and a shot or two of whiskey, and listen to that record all the way through. If that doesn't convince you that country music is soul music, you ain't got no soul power. 

* Ryan Adams - [Come Pick Me Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM0mjukDGRw). I'm not a huge fan of Ryan Adams, but this song and the album it's from are killers. Adams isn't among the ""canonized"" country stars like most of the others on this list, but he's a helluva songwriter, and this song proves it.  

* George Jones - [If Drinking Don't Kill Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY-epx63Dd8). Country music's greatest male vocalist of all time also had one or two brutal addictions in his life. One of the greatest stories in country music lore is the story of George Jones' wife taking all the keys for the cars with her when she left the house one day so his drunk ass wouldn't drive to the liquor store to get more booze. So he jumped on the riding lawn mower and went there anyway. 

* Patsy Cline - [She's Got You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWCUh6tf7PA). This is the anthem of every dumped lover. Patsy's just so damn elegant and her voice just drips with emotion. Country music is often about heartache and the problems of adulthood. This is a perfect example.   

* Loretta Lynn - [The Other Woman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gowANbNewo4). Loretta is queen bitch of country music. In this tune, she's singing from the perspective of a woman who's sleeping with a married man. She's slamming the wife throughout the song, too, which is pretty funny.  

* Dwight Yoakam - [Two Doors Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gDRz0SBhsU). If you can find the version of this song on his acoustic album ""dwightyoakamacoustic.net"" or the one on his most recent album, ""Swimming Pools, Movie Stars,"" then check those out. Even with this recording of the tune its tear-jerking power is unparalleled for the sad and lonesome. 

* Reverend Horton Heat - [Bales of Cocaine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpoE6yzZrxo). You like punk rock? Drugs? Funny stories? This'll scratch that itch. 

* Gram Parsons - [Sin City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rVzsEXk3kQ). Ok, this tune is actually by Parsons' most well-known band, The Flying Burrito Brothers, but it's Gram Parsons who you need to get to know. He played with The Byrds and inspired their flirtation with country music - a killer album called ""Sweetheart of the Rodeo"" - then the Burritos, then he discovered Emmylou Harris singing in a bar in Baltimore and convinced her to sing duet with him on two solo records. He also turned Mick Jagger and Keith Richards on to country music. In fact, the Burritos were the first band to record the Stones' classic ""Wild Horses,"" and really their version is better than the Stones' in my opinion. 

* Hidden track: Dolly Parton - [Jolene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGEubdH8m0s). Dolly Parton won the lottery. She's gorgeous, multi-talented (helluva guitar picker, voice is instantly recognizable, and she even acts!), and she's just so down-to-earth. Been married to the same dude, an electrician, for her entire adult life. This song features Dolly pleading with Jolene - who must be a total knock-out given what Dolly Parton brings to the table - to not steal her man.

I'm entitled to my opinion on the matter. I'll go through some of your comment while holding to my own opinion.

Do you not know what ""ad hominem"" means? I didn't insult you a single time in my original reply, let alone attempt to strengthen my argument based on an insult. 

&gt;TTK does not promote movement or camping by itself. It's not as if the TTK changes based on how if someone is moving or standing still.

It absolutely does, though - there's TTK and then *perceived TTK*, the latter of which is directly correlated to how reliably and often the optimal TTK is achievable (which also has implications on the skill gap). 

With a lower TTK, in the specific context of a game like TF where movement is (or should be) king, mechanics like aim-assist require far less from their user to kill fast-moving enemies in a short time-period. A higher TTK seeks to address this shortened skill gap, the same way a reduction in AA would. Higher TTK just doesn't screw with the aim mechanics, and was the smarter starting point, IMO, for Respawn. Not everyone can aim very well and I don't want them leaving the game. 

&gt; Higher TTK is actually a detriment to smart positioning approaches as I understand them. If I can just run around and take a couple of hits without any significant % of my health decreasing then positioning and approach matter LESS

But, that's where you're wrong - especially when you consider how slight the increases to TTK actually were for most weapons. We're talking about 1-2 more bullets to kill within intended ranges. This amount of change would mean very little in a game without a focus on movement. But, in a game like TF2, even slight adjustments make breaking LOS, using the environment, and maintaining speed/momentum considerably stronger tools in engagements. 

&gt;It pushes it more towards Regular CoD vs. Hardcore CoD

I have no clue what this means. But I'll end with this - this new playlist, IMO, is intended to cater to the players who embraced the movement mechanics long ago, all the while being forced to deal with campers or otherwise boots-on-the-ground playstyles who had a leg up in engagements just for standing still. 

The high-TTK playlist offers some breathing room for people who can leverage the environment and movement mechanics to control engagements.

&gt;Do you care to address my point of it High TTK Game Mode just turning into a melee and firestar contest or have you not even played the game type yet?

It's sad that you think these are the only two answers here, lol. I simply disagree with you that it has turned the game into a melee and firestar contest, and that's *because* I have played the playlist quite a bit already (but also, because of common sense).

Does COD do any kind of competitive playlist? (Something like Rocket League, Overwatch, CS:GO.. i.e. Ranking based on W/L. More strict rules vs. the normal playlist) CSGO and Rocket League both have 2 kinds of ranks. One more based on time, and another based on competitive skill. (Ranks and leveling maybe, idk the termonology for it. I actually never did any Overwatch comp, but I imagine its similar)

From what I've read, Call of Duty players have been in this mode: ""I unlocked everything, I maxed prestiged, then I got bored and stopped playing."" which is an attitude I've never subscribed to.

You can get a lot more hours out of a game, for me anyway, if you instead push the players to grind over a more a skill based rank. (INB4: W:L) rather than items. (So I would also argue, a competitive environment should have everything unlocked.

But I just want my damned loot boxes. And I'm sick and tired of spending 2hours plus in mayhem with people picking

Soldier. McRee. Widow. Tracer. Symmetra. Genji. 

Whyyyyyyyyyyy????

Even picks like Roadhog, Pharah, and Junkrat aren't that great. 

It's mayhem. It's been 4+ weeks since it's been in the playlist. You've probably played hours of Mayhem already. 

You should know by now. If you genuinely want to win. Please pick Lucio. Zarya. Winston. Sombra Mei. 

I just don't understand why people continue to pick shitty picks for Mayhem. When most of those picks their damage is essentially negated by the super fast cooldowns. Lucio, a Good Ana, and Mercy will just out heal and rez every play you attempt. 

Zarya will and should be overpowered every time. If your Zarya isn't. She's not doing her job. The problem will be enemy shields. And Mei. 

That's why we need a good Sombra. To constantly hack Mei and Lucio. To keep them from infinitely staying on the point. 

Most DPS is otherwise completely useless. Your fast cooldowns on your abilities don't really mean muy when the enemy team can out heal or shield your damage.

Winston otoh can Deal constant damage AND hide inside his shield. Team up w a Sombra hack or Mei freeze and Winston will kill most squishies before they can break free. Add to that. His Ult can knock back enemies giving you time to potentially cap the point / push the payload. 

You've had your fun. You've had your laugh. You died and the enemy capped the first point. Please switch off whatever shitty DPS or Def or other not really viable hero and actually try. 

And for those of you that say it's about having fun. Idk how those people who are Constantly dying or Not making ANY progress or contributing to the objective are having fun. I mean I guess it's the same as those who enjoy trolling or bad mannering. idk. 

Sure Mayhem can be mindless whatever. But are you really having fun or even just relaxing when you are constantly dying? Ugh. Go watch tv and be brain dead please. 

PS. Fuck You Symmetra for putting your tele on a cliff. 

Ugh. It was funny that one time. But I hope that the report system will get asshole Symmetras like you banned. I'm sad it won't. But it would be great justice if it actually does. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6i30u2,,,,,,,,,,,1497979811.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499509871.0,,,

Not to mention playlists like ""Taking Their Time – Some of the longest *songs in your collection*"" (emphasis mine). 

This is pure strategy tax, crippling on product (Groove local app, OneDrive music integration) to push another one (Music Pass).

i know exactly what you mean by the ""mystery"" thing and not guerilla marketing or being lame pop etc. but honestly dude, i shot myself in the foot with that mentality and you have to give yourself some wiggle room on that and compromise on things especially since you're lacking on finances. i don't know how else to convince you that i am also a conceited hipster about my music (i also like animal collective too?) but i am haha.  for me, i wanted to stay away from the things that my favorite artists don't do and be just like them, but it took me some time to realize I AM NOT THERE YET. i romanticized about the Weeknd's fucking ghost release like 7 years ago where he appeared to ""anonymously put out a track that went viral to pitchfork and drake"" and wanted to replicate the same, seemingly low-effort homerun based on ""merit"" of music.. but all image that is bull shit stuff with tonnes of inner workings below the surface and years of networking that happened beneath the surface.  i've let go of that mentality and i'm now serious as fuck about this as a business and brand. i still get into fights with my publicist about being ""too hipster for shit"" but hey it's a good balance and we find creative solutions that we are both happy with a lot of the itme. i honestly don't think i've compromised my allure and mystery and sold out to being another annoying laptop artist.. but maybe yeah i do post about my new vinyl on social media a bit more than Arca does and snapchat my cat a bit too much for FKA Twigs... for me, i didn't want to guerilla market and distance myself, not self-promote be a bit mysterious, separate myself from others etc. and i managed to do just that. how? by saving a tonne of money and hiring a publicist who ""gets it"" to push my stuff for me. like , everything costs money so i'm perplexed on how you're going to do anything. touring isn't the only thing that costs money. for my project, if i didn't spend big bucks on pro mixing/mastering/designers/photographers/cinematographers i wouldn't have great content in the first place. in my experience what has been useful in going from being a nobody debut artist with a first release, to getting on Huffington Post, Vice, Earmilk, AlbumOfTheYear.Org, Hype Machine 9 times, and getting booked for a US tour (im from Canada) all in 3 months since my release...is two major things: making great content, and being a great human being... One takes LOADS OF time/money/talent/hardwork, the other is free.  idk man everyone has their own journey... sorry to rant fuck... just seems like the finance thing and the friend who's doing other things is the biggest issue right now.. dm if you want.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6ibykn,,,,,,,,,,,1497938499.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499497795.0,,,

Wasn't seeing growth or anything. so i got depressed and stopped. i think i stopped around 45-50ish followers. i stopped for like 6 months or so and didn't pick up streaming till march 2017. The new Mass effect game was comming out so i did a lead up by playing all 3 mass effect games with one character. 1 a week till the game launched and then we jumped in. I set a schedule and started taking it seriously. I have since march streamed 5 days a week and aim for at least 4 hours. though nowdays i found my viewers wanted more and now stream upwards of 6-8 hours. trust me. its hard. its depressing, but if you can stick it out. push through those slow times its so freaking worth it. i suffer from chronic depression and since i started taking it seriously i have not really had a moment where i was crazy depressed. If im not on stream im cruising this subreddit, if im not doing that im managing my twitch channels youtube page, exporting, tagging, descriptions, playlists etc. or im scripting for my bot to bring new things, try new things or even messing with obs to find new ways to do things. expiriment on your free time. But if you want to take it seriously find a way to balance it out as it can and will take alot of your free time. :) i used to be on telegram, steam, etc all the time talking to people, and just plain dinking around. now days i don't really get a chance. im always working on something to improve, working on myself to make it all better. 
i've yet to find that perfect balance.

The next single she released, [""Rollercoaster""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvKewY8gAeU) is a cheesy bad song, that one I get being forgettable, but her second single was made for being a uniform piece in pop. 

There just seem to be some unknown reasons for why her momentum went to a complete halt. Again, she had a Top 10 international hit on Republic, so they had the resources and reason to at least push 2 more singles out of her. Even Ruth B, whose single ""Lost Boy"" reached #24 with limited international success has released an album already.

Stop trying to dodge. I challenge you to back up your smear about democrats. You made a very serious accusation about them and now it's time to back them up with actual links. Either you do  that or I just call you a lying sack of shit and ignore everything you say.

No you made the accusation that Republicans and Democrats were the same. This means you need to link to actual elected officials or pundits on television saying the same things. Some random person on some unnamed web site at some time doesn't work.

&gt;
&gt;Waking up in the now familiar room, I lost that sense of fear and dread I once had since the first time I woke up here. Each time something changes, it makes me wonder if I'm skipping days in this other life, even weeks. I've started to leave the house now, only for a little while. I still find it difficult getting ready to go out as Kate. When I shower, I close my eyes out of respect for this body that is not my own. My hair takes so much effort to wash and dry, I've never had long hair and this is ridiculously hard work. I sit on the bed in the mirror with a hairdryer and a brush and I am hypnotized by this girl. Even with wet hair blowing everywhere, she is hard to take your eyes off. She has grown thinner and paler since the first morning I woke up in a vomit stained bed. I feel a sense of concern for her.
&gt;
&gt;With her hair dry, I walk around the room trying to find clothes to wear today. I go for black high waisted jeans and a basic white baggy t-shirt tucked into the jeans. I see a red lipstick labelled ""Man Killer Red"" and laugh to myself as I apply it to her lips, I mean, this is the only chance I could ever have the excuse to wear a lipstick with a name like that. My real self would look like a little kid who tripped and fell into her mother's makeup bag if I attempted it.
&gt;
&gt;The sun was bright when I left the house, after going through her laptop and phone I have worked out where it is I'm supposed to go to class. I can't cope with the loneliness of sitting in her room anymore, the fear of being out in her world is still as intense as ever, but figured that maybe this can take my mind off it until I go to sleep and leave her again. I got on the bus with her bus card that I found in a little heart shaped tin on her dressing table and sat down, looking out the window during the journey with her earplugs in and listening to more of her playlist. This time it was 'Hold On' by SBTRKT, a dreamy electronic track, her taste in music always surprises me. We drove through street after street, women pushing their babies in prams, kids running around with their dog. This is a small town which is about 4 hours from where I live.
&gt;
&gt;The thought has crossed my mind to find my old self in 2015, unfortunately if I did that I would be living in Johannesburg, South Africa. We lived there for 3 years before moving back last year. Joburg gets a bad rep, but we had a good experience in our time there. I actually preferred it to Cape Town, which is often a favourite of visitors. 
&gt;Our house was in one of the nicer areas, with big houses all displaying security signs outside the big metal gates and big cars in the driveways. My favourite place was a street downtown which was considered dangerous by my parents and their friends, but I have been there a couple times in secret with friends. It's where everything happens, street vendors, cool shops which double up as salons, traditional art galleries next to cola shops which only sell cola but in dozens of varieties. What I loved most were the signs on the buildings, old painted signs advertising products which have long died. It's hard to find character like that in the more richer areas. Nothing bad had ever happened to me there but I had heard stories from girls I knew who said they had been stopped by criminals at night, who mugged them and left them there alone.  
&gt;
&gt;The bus stopped with a thud, abruptly ending my trail of thought. We stopped about 3 minutes from my destination according to the maps app on my cracked phone. I got off and started walking toward the gates of the university, and proceeded up the steps to the main reception. A friendly looking receptionist greeted me as if she hadn't seen me in years. ""Kate! Wow so great to see you back here, do you want to know where you're meant to be?"", I said hello and that I'd love that. That was exactly what I needed. She walked me through the wooden halls, her heels tapping and making the loudest sound. Some guys in passing were looking at me, that's an unusual feeling for me, guys generally don't look at me like that.
&gt;
&gt;We walked through some doors and through another hall, the building was actually pretty cool, very old with traditional detailing on the ceilings and the walls. She opened the big wooden doors at the very top of the building and we walked into what I can only describe as a large attic studio. There were about 20 people in there, some half hidden by their easels and a naked man in the middle of them, casually waving at me. Everyone was very quick to come say hi and give me a hug, apart from the naked model, thankfully. 
&gt;
&gt;I have to say, the weirdest part of this day was that for someone who can't draw a stick figure, it was the oddest sensation to confidently pick up a charcoal stick and start sketching. I'm thinking it is muscle memory, but something just took over me and my hands knew exactly what I wanted to do. And there it was, an impressive sketch of this man in front of me. My teacher came by and complimented me on a job well done before going on to the next student. I just stood there looking at my hands which were now black from the charcoal, and possibly my face too judging by the chuckles from the guy next to me. It was a very weird sensation. And I really regretted wearing that white t-shirt.
&gt;
&gt;At the end of the day I was stopped by Theo, the guy who first contacted me when I had no idea who I even was. He has class at a different part of the building but he had heard I was back from some of the uni gossips. He was very cute, fluffy blonde hair and a ridiculous shirt that screamed ""I'm a film student"".
&gt;
&gt;I felt a bit of a fraud talking to him as if I knew him but what else was I to do? ""Oh hi, just so you know, I may look like Kate but I'm actually a really boring nursing student borrowing her body for a little while"". You could tell he had a lot to ask me but was biting his tongue as to not scare me off, but our casual chit chat was interrupted by the funniest car horn I've heard in a while. It was like an old 1940s siren. I looked in the direction of the noise and there was a car parked outside the gate, it was a small white 80s ford with some guy driving it who seemed to be gesturing to me. The horn went off again and Theo rolled his eyes and said begrudgingly ""I guess you're going to go with him then?"", am I?! Oh god I froze on the spot, am I supposed to know this guy? I didn't want to make a scene so I did possibly the most stupid thing I've done in a while and said my goodbyes to Theo before walking in the direction of the stranger in the car.
&gt;
&gt;As I got closer I saw the driver. He didn't get out. I opened the door and sat down. The man next to me smiled before leaning over and kissing me lightly on the head. Theo shot me a look from the entrance like I was an idiot, I could see his eyes roll even all the way from the car. The atmosphere changed as soon as I was in the car, the stranger was blaring ""International Dateline"" by Ladytron on his tinny sounding old speakers. One song I actually knew, surprisingly. I analyzed his face as we drove, I won't beat around the bush here, he was extremely attractive. I couldn't help but think just how much Astrid would have gone crazy for him, absolutely her type. He was tall, I could tell even as he was sat down from his long limbs. He was skinny, his black hair mostly covered his dark eyebrows and brown eyes ...And he was American. It was undeniable his accent was American in the very few words he said to me.
&gt;
&gt;He stopped the car near a docking area, we still hadn't said many words to each other and it was getting dark out. The only noises were seagulls and large trucks with containers driving through the area. It wasn't exactly the most romantic scene. He lit a cigarette and looked at me, ""what's with the lipstick, man killer?"" He said jokingly as if he knew me well enough to even know what the name of my lipstick was. The smoke he exhaled as he said it made my nose hurt. I hate smoking, but it seemed to suit him and the stereotypical look he was going for. He then processed to tell me he was thinking of leaving and as we haven't known each other that long, he wasn't sure if I cared or not, just that I should know. I felt once again like a fraud when I replied ""ofcourse I care"", do I? I don't even know him. He said he might leave to work abroad with his friend, also American. He didn't say what kind of job and I didn't dare to ask. I later found out his name, he is called Damien, like that evil kid from the Omen. I watched that film to death with my dad when I was a kid, I love horror movies.
&gt;
&gt;He placed his hand on my knee and leaned in to kiss me, suddenly a dark figure appeared standing behind one of the trucks. It started screaming. And then... it flickered. Like an old tv. And then the truck flickered with it. Damien didn't seem to notice it because he asked me what was wrong. I looked up at the birds and they were flying in circles, faster and faster and I couldn't tell anymore that they were birds until one flew into the car and smashed into the window, splashing red and feathers, with its eyes looking at him. I passed out.
&gt;
&gt;I woke up in bed again, except it wasn't Kate's bed. It was my bed. I had blood on my hands and on my pillow too, frantically I jumped up, knocking a lamp and breaking the glass on the wooden floor in the process. I ran to the mirror on my dresser and there it was, red smothered across my lips and cheek. It was the lipstick Kate had been wearing. Man Killer Red.

t5_2vq0w,,,,False,,,,,,,DestinyTheGame,,,,,,dj2tvwc,,,0,,,,sc_slayerage,,,t3_6i0e4x,161,,,,,,"I've said since a month after Destiny came out that Destiny should have a ranked playlist or two. However, as much as I would like that personally as a hardcore player (as would many others), Destiny has always been a game where the skill required to do the hardest things isn't super high.

I've come to accept there is a good reason for that. Destiny is just not a game that is designed to let hyper skillful players stand apart from the  dedicated player base, and even though I don't really like that, I have come to terms with it. The reality is that a ton of players fall into the category of ""dedicated,"" as in hundreds or thousands of hours played, but simply will never be as good as the ones who constantly try to push their skill levels to the limits. For most people, I would suspect that enjoying themselves trumps investing the thousands of hours that are necessary to be the best pvp player. Bungie's design philosophy creates an environment where dedicated players feel that they have done and seen it all, and they don't want to foster a community where those hyper skilled players run the show and create a ""level of play"" that the aforementioned dedicated players will never experience.

The most significant reason behind that philosophy is that the furthest reaches of the endgame will always get the most attention once everything else runs dry. Take for example Trials these days on Twitch - it's always been the most popular to watch because it demonstrates the most skill. Ranked playlists would make ranked pvp, in all likelihood, the most popular thing. The community would focus more on it, and we'd have a community less focused on fun and more on being the best. Not to be a total doomsayer, but I do think it is extremely likely that the Destiny community being the great place it is is due in *huge* part to Bungie preventing skilled players from running the show however they can. I feel it is very likely that, if ranked play were introduced, the Destiny community would look a lot more like the Overwatch community. For those of you who haven't experienced ranked Overwatch, it's really not that uncommon to get trash talked for a mistake in competitive play. It is a good game, but the community can't hold a candle to Destiny.

My point being: I fully understand their reticence with ranked play, and I too have concerns that if it were implemented without proper regard for how it will impact the player, it would do much more harm than good.

I don't agree with his statement that they are making sacrifices in pve to make the pvp experience be better, and I also think he makes it sound like too much of a foregone conclusion that better pvp balance should lead to ranked pvp. I think it's a bit silly to imply that improving something would somehow mean it needs to go a different direction.

Still, I do agree with the most driving point Datto makes throughout his video about following through and creating meaning behind the gameplay. Ranked or not, Datto is completely right about the need for more substance behind some game modes. Rankings may be the best solution, but I'd rather have a game where I can't stand out as much versus getting yelled at for not using my ult right. This is a topic Bungie has to be careful to do right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6i0e4x,,,,,,,,,,,1497817759.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499458090.0,,,

I don't think a ranked playlist really caters exclusively to the top 1% though (this is Datto btw).  I really don't think it does.  I think everyone at some point gets interested in seeing where they stand.

I don't want Bungie to take away the casualness of the game; of course that would ruin the experience for FAR more players.  All I'm asking for is the slightest greater focus on those players who DO stick around day after day, month after month.  If you shut us the hell up with stuff like ranked playlists, scoring leaderboards, etc, then we're entertained for thousands of more hours and they can focus on more casual stuff.

It's like in RoI they came out with Outbreak Prime, put in the hard mode raid, wiped their hands and said, ""Aaaaaaaaand hardcore players are satisfied.""  Well, yeah, we were for that short time.  RoI probably isn't a fair comparison though.

Every time I make a video like this, I have a little voice just nagging me saying, ""You know Bungie is never going to do the stuff you ask for, pretty much ever, right?""  But I say it anyway because I don't know.  I just feel like a slight investment into the people who play the game far more than someone who just completes the story and bails would be better than Bungie thinks.  Unfortunately, I don't think we'll ever get the data on that theory.

I saw someone else say that I don't appear to be very enthused with D2 or whatever as well.  I'm still VERY excited for this game, both as a YTer/Streamer and purely as a player, trust me on that.  I'm just concerned right now about some things I've seen and that concern will not go away until we get the game.  I've spoken with some Bungie folks about various things in the builds I've played at E3 and the D2 reveal and every time I have a bit of feedback, I get ""oh, that's different in the new build,"" ""that's gone in the new build,"" so it's tough to try to give that feedback to them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6i0e4x,,,,,,,,,,,1497812535.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499456188.0,,,

To expand on what GJL928 said, if you're constantly fighting 1v2+, one of two things is happening. Either the enemy is wolfpacking like no one's business and just playing well in general to separate your team, or you're lone wolfing it all the time and constantly overextending. If it's the first one, then you better hope your team has mics because if not, you're basically screwed.

If it's the second one, then just remember that it's a team gametype and you should be with your team or supporting them during 99% of the game. The 1% is when important plays need to happen fast and you just have to do something, e.g. the OS just came up and your team needs it but you're the only one with a chance to contest it, so you peel off and leave them for a a few seconds. You don't have to stick to your team like a tick, but you should be doing your best to work in concert with them. If they're setting up, fill in the gaps. If they're making a push, get on the front line, flank, or support from the side.

 Also, knowing when to chase and when to chill is extremely important. If you're in plat 6, it's possible you have a decent understanding of this already, but I'll throw it in here anyway since not understanding it is a common cause of your problem. If you have a tendency to chase kills and forfeit positioning in the process, this is absolutely the root of the issue. Halo plays much faster these days, but it's still a game of patience. Getting a guy one-shot doesn't mean you HAVE to clean him up right now. If you have to give up a good position and put yourself in danger to do so, leave him. Call him out and hope a teammate can get him, but if not, it doesn't matter. It's not worth your life and your setup. High level Halo is a lot like high level chess-- positions are just as important if not more important than the pieces.

Going off of that, a deficiency in general map knowledge and awareness can cause your problem. Again, you might be fine in this area since you're upper-mid in the ladder, but it's worth​ mentioning. Map knowledge at a basic level entails knowing the layout of the map, but further than that, it means knowing how to play the map. I mean things like how to push certain areas or how to defend certain areas, or how to put pressure on enemies without endangering your team, or what the most common routes are and how to control them and use them. Awareness, then, is being conscious of how these things are being used at any given time. Knowing​ that a target's team can quickly  save him from a push and knowing how they're likely to do it is just one way that these things can keep you from having to fight 1v2+ encounters.

Above all, getting a team to play with will have the biggest impact on your games. In regards to 1v2+ encounters, you still have to follow the guidelines I laid out, but it will be much easier to do so with a coordinated team. Communication is how you control positions, so communication is how you win games (and get that sweet  onyx).

I hope some of that helped! If you have questions just ask and I'll try to explain better.

Edit: Almost forgot-- review your gameplay! Theater mode is an amazing tool for people trying to improve. If you can't figure out what went wrong in a situation, go back and watch it.

I'm a bit of a word nerd though. I do remember being impressed with how the structure of his sentences related to the topic at hand (for example, in one chapter about pushing and popping onto stacks, he has a sentence with lots of embedded clauses such that the verbs all get ""popped"" at the end of the sentence).

But breastfeeding can be awful, and I don't think most moms prepare themselves for just how much it can hurt. I don't think most moms consider deciding on how much they're willing to handle before they're willing to quit.

And everyone thinking about breastfeeding needs a reality check that it isn't always this beautiful harmonious connection between you and your baby, despite how it seems like most women who bring up breastfeeding in their birth stories say ""he feeds like a champ, it's great.""

I was completely unprepared for the newborn phase because I was unprepared for the excruciating pain every time my son latched. I was prepared for things like lots of baby crying... lots of diaper changes... lots of spit-up... and maybe 2 weeks of discomfort with breastfeeding. I thought it would go away after that and I did not realize that the amount of pain I was in wasn't normal. I didn't think I would be in so much pain I would cry and my entire body would tense up for the first 30 seconds or more of every feeding. 

We had major latch issues, my son had a lip tie I never even noticed, I was stupid and thought the nurses would have looked for it. And he struggled to get a deep latch because he wasn't opening his mouth very wide.

My nipples looked like raw hamburger. Blood and all. They were cracked, chapped, and SO tender. And this shit lasted 8 weeks. It was almost better around week 6 and then I got a plugged milk duct that ruined progress because I had to pump and dangle nurse constantly to try and get it out.

If you're planning on breastfeeding you NEED TO DO SOME RESEARCH. Watch some videos about getting a deep latch. It doesn't just come naturally and babies have some weird reflexes that can make them hit the boob and arch their backs away from you, and... damn. Yes. Just prepare yourself. Because breastfeeding amplified my anxiety, it made me cry a lot, it made me feel like a failure thanks to hormonal mood swings, and I wanted to quit, but I also was so scared of my husband being disappointed in me for not pushing through the pain, and I just was not prepared for any of it. 

So watch videos. Watch a bunch of them, bookmark them, add them to a YouTube playlist or whatever. And go see the lactation consultants if you're suffering.

Here's some stuff to start with. 

http://www.naturalbreastfeeding.com/

https://youtu.be/-l5BpqllTLg

https://youtu.be/deKN3wJ17Mk

https://youtu.be/Zln0LTkejIs &lt; about the 3:40 mark on this one shows a good latch - in the hospital they just shoved my baby's face straight on and it wasn't working, but when you try to have their chin touch your breast and make them reach for the nipple with a wide open mouth, that's going to have a better chance at getting a deep latch. 

Remember that you can also use a breast shield. Or you can pump and feed with a bottle. 

And there's always formula. Do not beat yourself up if the pain, anxiety, and sleep deprivation make you decide that it's better for your situation to choose formula. The MOST important thing is that your baby is fed and growing. Torturing yourself because someone told you Breast Is Best is a slippery slope straight to postpartum depression and anxiety, fights with your spouse, and really dark thoughts.

While breastfeeding is natural, and babies are born with instincts to find the breast, that doesn't mean it's easy and painless. I suddenly realized... huh... maybe this is why some animals abandon their babies? Maybe they kick the runt out because their tiny mouths can't get a good latch and the mama says NOPE, OUCH! I don't know, but it suddenly seemed like a really plausible factor behind why some animals die because they're rejected by their mom. When my son would latch on and clamp down on my cracked and inflamed nipples with his hard palate, it felt like being stabbed with knives straight through my back, shooting pains down my back and arms, and my entire body would tense up and my toes would curl into the carpet. Don't let yourself just accept this as ""normal breastfeeding pain"" because it isn't normal. Something isn't right and it needs to be fixed.

Be prepared. It's scary to think about, but if you're willing to listen to what might happen if you have latch problems, you'll be better equipped to manage the stress and think clearly when you're in the glider (or reclined really far back on the couch like the naturalbreastfeeding site suggests) with your baby at 3am and you're running on 3 hours of sleep.

This time around... I told my husband I'm giving myself a month to get it figured out. I told him I'm not going to do 8 weeks of that shit before it finally gets better like I did with my first. Because I wholeheartedly believe it was a MAJOR factor in my postpartum depression and anxiety, and I hated myself during those times. I'm not going to force myself to do that, I'm just not. I told him I did it because I was scared of him acting disappointed in me, and I want to go into it this time KNOWING that he will have my back if I decide we need to formula feed. 

This won't happen for everyone but I hope that more moms will decide before their baby is born how much they're willing to handle and at what point they're willing to try something else.

I've been messing around a lot with MIDItorio over the last few days and decided we needed a shuffle function to add on to our factorio music libraries so we can have a programmable jukebox.  This builds on to existing MIDItorio blueprints and allows for randomized playback of any number of songs without ANY input from you (besides pushing the 'on' button).  After you turn it on it will continue playing all of your songs in a random order until you turn it back off.  If you want to watch the video, it demos the setup and explains how it works and how you can build it in your base.  If you aren't a video fan then I'll do my best below to give a summary of how to integrate it into your base.

Instructions for use (the video will probably be much more clear here since you can see what is going on as I explain it):

1) set up RNG variables--constant combinator in the middle of the bottom row (with the light below it): 
variable D should be set to 1 more than the number of songs you will be shuffling through (i.e. set to 6 if you have 5 songs).  This sets the bounds for the number generator.  Turning this combinator on and off controls whether the entire setup will play music or be turned off (hence why 'shuffle' is spelled out on it).  Keep it off for now.

2) building decider combinator for each song:
You will need to add 1 decider combinator for each additional song that you want to include.  Each of these combinators will be set to ""C = track number"" (start with c=1 for the first song's combinator and increment by 1 to match the track number as you increase the number of songs and therefore combinators.  This means that the combinator for song 4 will be C=4.  The output command will be the same for all of these combinators: red signal of 1.

3) wiring it all together:
   build enough poles along your line of music so that you can attach red and green wires into each song.  The wires are pre-wired on the number generator side (blueprint) so you will just need to worry about the song side.  The red wire will connect to the output of the first decider combinator in each song (the one that the 'play' and 'reset' constant combinators are attached to in the MIDItorio blueprint).  The green wire is attached to the input of each song's 'track number' decider combinator (the one we built earlier).  One more green wire is then attached from the output of this combinator to the output of the same decider combinator that the red wire was hooked into (so both green and red wires end up attached to the same point).  

4) Finishing it up!
Set each song's 'play' constant combinator to 'on' (yes, this means that all of your songs will play through once before you can use this setup) but leave the 'reset' combinator off.  Now when you turn the constant combinator next to the light in the number generator setup on (from step 1), everything should turn on and you should have shuffling music!",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6hji3i,,,,,,,,,,,1497577147.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499387227.0,,,

Just about every moba is 70% making the right decisions at the right time, 30% everything else. It's the difference between watching Imsko 1v1 someone late game in enemy jungle while you get dunked by 3 people who rotated on you trying to do the same thing. 

It's really hard to go over the small nuances of it, but I feel the best way to better understand the game and improve this game sense is to find one hero or role you REALLY enjoy and really focus on trying to master that. Once you feel you are actually strong at that role... find another hero in another role you feel attached to and try to master them! Eventually you will have a better understanding of what other heroes in your game are doing or want to be doing which is really valuable to becoming a stronger player. 

Above all... STOP FOCUSING ON YOUR ELO. Get off of Agoragg. Stop prioritizing your KDA over your enjoyment of your hero.

The comments and rudeness will always come from middle schoolers no matter what you try that is new and pushes them out of their comfort zone, but if it's something you believe in and have passion about all that silliness and nonsense subsides, especially when these new ideas become routine. 

It turns from ""Wtf is this, why are we breathing for a minute, why am I being asked to clear my mind, this guy is crazy"" to ""Awesome I finally get a minute of silence, something I never get since people are always talking in class, parents yelling at home, Hmm if I actually try I can improve crazy idea I always thought I had to be born smart, I love this time of silence where I feel safe."" 

From GoNoodle I use the channels Flow and Think About It for mindfulness, Empower Tools for some classroom yoga, Fresh Start for class exercise breaks for those periods with more boys than girls, and I did try Blaze Fresh but it's a little too cheesy for my students so I just made playlist channels on YouTube of Just Dance songs from the game and they love taking dance breaks to that over Blaze Fresh. This is central Los Angeles so dancing hip hop and old school is not really something kids at my school are shy about, yes you get some laughs here and there but a brain break is a brain break I wouldn't be so hard on making it rigid and controlled - appropriate yes. 

Again if you're uncomfortable your students will be, I don't mind looking like a fool trying to dance to Daft Punk and it's a nice time to get those students some space to show their strengths of something beyond writing notes even if it is for only a couple of minutes. The general idea is to build relationships and learn about your students so that you can use those things as motivation to get what you really want from them which is to listen to your directions and do well academically.

PvP is an absolutely non-essential part of the game, there are 2 types of server PvE and PvP. I play on PvE because its way more fun for me to be able to chill and quest and not worry about getting ganked. There are PvP options but I'd say PvE is the focus of the game for sure. You won't need to read guides if you start a fresh character, the game is pretty intuitive and the guides are more there to maximise your effectiveness which is absolutely unnecessary if you plan to play at a more casual level. By this I mean unless you're pushing into raiding at heroic level you can usually just fart arse around and you'll be okay as long as you keep pushing buttons. The game usually introduces you to the abilities in a way that you pick up the right order anyway. Theres hundreds of hours of easy content to push through and personally I've found it to be one of the better game investments in my life. You might see a lot of complaints about grindiiness of the game or whatever but a lot of it come from players who have been playing the same expansion for a year and a half and need something fresh to chew on. 

If you need a bit of inspiration this is what I did when I started mulling over joining the game (which was only just earlier this year and I'm currently in a guild that plays at the highest level of raiding so it's easy to pick up and improve quickly!). I am a bit of a nerd too and I love to story of warcraft and it made playing the game a really enjoyable adventure instead of just strange collections of names and places. SO i watched Nobbel87s youtube series on the lore of World of Warcraft [Link Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ__nRnO2mE&amp;list=PLV3Yvqnl3FYcsI4px2GaIxUQ8io4kuZ2s). It got me super into the atmosphere and I enjoyed the levelling and the gameplay and story of the later expansions made it an absolute blast to play. I think you'd quite enjoy it, strongly recommend watching the first video in the playlist its sort of a short here's the story and it is a pretty solid summary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6he5dt,,,,,,,,,,,1497529748.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499367531.0,,,

But early on, having pressure from someone else to study really helped them! I think it's really important to schedule out time to study so you don't put it off. I also schedule breaks, too.

If you have space, I also recommend making a study area! My room has a built-in desk that I use for my laptop, stationery, fake succulents (for the aesthetic), a bag with Chapstick/lotion/etc because you never know, and a fidget cube. Having a separate place that's solely for studying also motivates me 👍

I hope that helped! Don't push yourself too hard but work to make studying a habit :•)

What you think of as a negative, I believe would be a positive.  The boosting issue aside, by restricting party rank, matchmaking could become more accurate.  No longer will the game have to pull in random people to match up against groups such as you and your friends.  Other popular online multiplayer games do this for their ranked playlists. Example being League of Legends won't let a a diamond and gold player party up and play ranked together (Unless it has changed since I last played).

&gt; Boosting players is not such a massive problem that it is worth ruining the game for others simply because you got yours and you couldn't give 2 shits about other people.

Your intention is not to boost, but your still causing problems by having matchmaking try and put together a fair team for you to play against.  

Currently you are free to play ranked with anyone, and we can't fault anyone who does because the game currently allows, but I would like to see it change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6h85ui,,,,,,,,,,,1497475645.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499352133.0,,,

Though I'd be shocked if Google doesn't catch up inevitably.

It boils down to taste. Right now if your goal is to simply have a solid music platform, GPM is probably the best bet. If your goal is to expand your tastes through discovery, collaborative playlists with fellow enthusiasts, and you have a willingness to be pushed outside your genre comfort zone, Spotify is simply leaps and bounds ahead of the competition.

DJ's have some say in what they play, but the vast majority of their selections must be made from a fairly small, predefined playlist. DJs at Go 96.3 probably have more input into their daily playlist then the Current's on-air talent. APMG have made a business decision to go after a wealthier and older audience, one more in line with traditional public broadcasting audiences than when the Current first started and that means a highly-controlled, bland and uncontroversial playlist.

Most of the Current DJ's hate the music that they play, but it's a sweet gig compared to other radio gigs in town that aren't for KFAN or Dave Ryan-level personalities.  The Current has basically moved into being the station for middle-aged people who no longer pay attention to music but still want everyone to think they are cool, the niche that Cities97 used to occupy before the Current pushed them out and they had to move into KS95's space. 

If they play anything outside their narrow band of easy-listening ""indie rock"" the station gets deluged with complaints.  God forbid someone plays a rap song that isn't Atmosphere/Doomtree/Chance because the phones will light up.  Similarly hosts aren't allowed to play anything that trends to far towards hard rock/metal or EDM. For a station that claims to play music based on it's artistic merits, they manage to avoid about 75% of releases that make they year-end lists from respected pop-music critics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6gzzmv,,,,,,,,,,,1497394533.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499324540.0,,,

My understanding of Clause 4 as a child was obviously incomplete, and as you rightly point out my appeal to northerness is a bit of a cheap shot. I was brought up by hippy communists essentially, my Mum never went to Greenham common but she brought home a few friends who had. Clause 4 was certainly a talking point in our house, but I doubt it was in many households on our street. I have some very distinct memorys of my 'dad' (mum's fella at the time) waxing lyrical on it while we had Radio 4 on in the car. 

On the indoctrination point, I'm going to wait till my lad is at least 10 before I drop words like bourgeois lol, I'm curious to see how much he figures out on his own. My mum, despite her left tendencies, thought metal was akin to devil music, guess who went to Slipknot's first UK gig! Gently does it as far as political indoctrination goes, we have a couple of Michael Rosen books in our library and that's as far as I'm willing to push it right now.

I read Jone's article today, and although I agreed with parts of it, especially where rewarding talent goes, there are gaps in his argument. Surely even he wouldn't see Abbott retaining her current position. One lesson Labour should learn from the Tories is not to air our dirty laundry in public, the stakes are too bloody high for that. A concession in the next shadow cabinet is necessary, and if Corbyn is to build on his success, there needs to be a couple of headline grabbers to that end. 

Also, thanks for the Partridge gif, I'll stick that episode on first tonight in my telly to fall asleep to playlist. Sniff my cheese!

t5_2qy4s,,,,False,,,,,,,rally,,,,,,diurfyo,,,0,,,,jeremiahishere,,,t3_6gsnar,2,,,,,,"I rallycross regularly in an [old bmw](http://i.imgur.com/ORJJByK.jpg).  It is not my daily driver but I have a 2 hour drive home after events.

In 2.5 years of rallycross, I have never had a something fail in a way that I couldn't get home.  On the other hand, I drive around ruts and holes when possible.  I slow down for things that could be jumps.  On the smooth courses, I am near the top of the RWD.  On the bumpy or rutted courses, I lose a second or two every 60 seconds of run time.  You need to decide if you will still have fun driving at 8/10 instead of 10/10.

One caveat is that you should never rallycross on steel wheels.  They fail in interesting ways, often with [the bolts still attached to part of the wheel](http://i78.photobucket.com/albums/j85/irish44j/2016%20Rallycross/IMG_20160424_155540485.jpg).  Alloy wheels occasionally bend but I have never seen one fail catastrophically.

What region are you in?  Different rallycross sites are hard on cars in different ways.  For example, Middle Georgia, outside of Macon, has a smooth clay lot that turns into bumpy tarmac once the top layer is gone.  In Central Florida, we run on sand.  It doesn't build ruts but we do dig holes.  Maryland has a gravel lot that develops ruts deep enough that your oil pan gets blasted with gravel.  [This playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf0SepbCe06rHJ77urM0-NPg4IkJp8MV7) has 5 different surfaces in the first 10 videos.

With all that in mind, the Fiesta ST is one of the better cars for the Stock and Prepared classes.  It is lightweight, narrow, and has enough power to get out of it's own way.  All you need to be competitive in Stock class is a set of snow tires, a skid plate, and a disconnected front sway bar.  In Prepared you get to upgrade to an LSD, increased boost, and rally tires.

There are two concerns with the Fiesta ST that I don't have in my car.  

It is a top heavy car.  There is a small chance of rolling the car when you are pushing hard.  You won't get there in your first event or even your first year of events.  Keep it in mind if there are any off camber corners where the car is sliding.  You are in charge of your own safety in this case.

On most FWD cars, full throttle at full steering lock results in a broken axle.  It is pretty tempting to floor it to save a spin.  I don't know if the fiesta is susceptible to this.  The easy solution for this is a AAA premium membership and $300 to buy and install a new axle.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6gsnar,,,,,,,,,,,1497377206.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499316579.0,,,

I think a ranked playlist adds a lot. It's all about personal preference. I understand why you wouldn't care for it, but I don't think that means it needs to be excluded entirely. It gives players a sense of accomplishment outside of the PvE side. There really isn't anything like that in Destiny right now. Seeing your rank increase as you play is a really great feeling. I've played sports my entire life and now that I'm out of them, I massively enjoy getting better at games and seeing it reflected in a ranking system. In casuak playlists, you never really know if it's you who played well or the fact that the other team just stunk it up. It's how a lot of us are when it comes to PvP gaming. 

I also enjoy sitting back and screwing around. The ability to do both is something I think should absolutely be in the game. It doesn't hurt anyone unless they need to pull back resources on other parts of the game, but I don't think that's a problem. Obviously none of us can confirm that, however. 

I'm curious though, what negative effects do you think a ranked playlist would have? I actually think it's more beneficial. Being pushed into making sure the game is balanced for ranked playlist also helps those who don't play ranked. In the end, it's still balancing for everyone.",,,,Atheon,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6gzv4h,,,,,,,,,"Push me off, I dare you",,1497376892.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499316431.0,,,

I don't see why they can't have a ranked playlist. I honestly dont. They've fucking struck out on 60 fps and custom matches at launch. Now no ranked play? PC delayed by 7 weeks? 

You say Destiny PvE is what they push heavily but what is the one game mode that people can play for months that is technically ever-changing? PvP. 

Content dries up in PvE. It absolutely will dry up at launch. Every game with this ""MMO"" model has dry runs. So giving players who enjoy PvP the ability to work towards rewards in a ranked system would be genius.

t5_2qixk,,,,1497370163,,,,,,,halo,,,,,,diuk2ir,,,0,,,,volunteeroranje,,,t3_6gv0fj,2,,,,,,"I think my frustration from the ranking system, particularly with HCS is this:

- I see Golds across the board for some people and they're gold's in HCS.  Similar with silver players too.  And they seem to perform consistently across playlists.

- For platinum though I see more of a wide range of skills.  People that are Onyx in Arena or Slayer, but still Plat in HCS. People that are legit Plats across the board, and sometimes have never been higher than plat.

-  It's frustrating because I think it compresses some skill levels together that should be more separated.  When I see a legit gold in HCS I feel like the performance level is pretty consistent.  When I see a random plat level player their performance can legitimately be 22-5 or 2-17.  And this isn't something I only see occasionally, but a spread like that multiple times a night.

It just makes the solo grind frustrating.  I haven't been playing all that well at points this season so I dropped out of Diamond and back into Plat, but I was a low Onyx player (from 1500 to ~1950) in Team Arena in the past.  I know what I'm doing generally, understand spawns and the meta, communicate, etc.  But the issue is that I can get into a game of players that are similar CSRs and apparently MMRs, but literally have no clue what's going on.  It just seems weird to me.  And I've heard this from friends of mine that are much better than me, and friends that aren't as good.  I'm not so much worried about what my rank is, but whether the new rankings are working as intended.  

I get that CSR was inflated in the past, mine included, but it feels like tryhards are being forced to play with casual players and vice versa, which isn't fun for the casual players either.  I just feel like there should be more separation in skill levels.

And the smurfing issue has gotten worse, which definitely makes it harder to gain CSR if you're losing to artificially low ranked players.  I don't mind playing high level players, I'm always trying to improve.  But it's frustrating losing to a level 8 gold 4 player that dropped 25 kills with one of my teammates going 4-16 because they solo pushed into a 4v1 every time, and then I lose 19 CSR despite playing well personally.

We've been along for the ride as patches, new maps with flow improvements, balancing, etc. has happened, but in order to do some fundamental changes (Damage done to core, randomized bosses, for instance) they would have to take warzone offline, improve it, and then release the new version.

It's been a long road to where I'm at now, I'm incredibly lucky to have the resources to do all this and I wouldn't have gotten this far without the help of my friend who's a serious pro at this line of work. He never told me something was good enough, only ways I can improve it and it's been pushing me to work harder every time. Believe me I know it's daunting as all hell starting out, it took me a long time to really get the hang of things though lots of failure but each failure was worth it. 

If you want my suggestion, start by making some boxes in either Blender or 3ds Max if you can get your hands on it (if you have a .edu email you can get a student version like me). 

Topics to look up:

* UV Unwrapping 
* UV layout 
* Beveling in 3ds Max/Blender
* Chamfer edges in 3ds Max/Blender 
* Extrude in 3ds Max/Blender
* Turbosmooth workflow 
* Smoothing groups 
* Crease modifier (if you're in 3ds Max)

With those tools you can make some really nice looking boxes, crates, and whatever other basic cube shape fits your fancy. Once the modeling is done you can do UV unwrapping which, while it's a pain in the ass, should be much easier if you stick with a cube/box form. 3ds Max has tools that blow others out of the water in regards to this. 

Once you have your basic box/crate done (which I know I'm pulling a ""draw the rest of the owl"" situation here), download the free trial of  [Substance Painter 2](https://www.allegorithmic.com/buy/download) and check out their [Youtube playlist for getting started](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB0wXHrWAmCx994Cb7iRFSmupYHFw5DTx). 

It's all about patience, cause it's gonna take awhile to get the hang of whatever software you choose, but I believe you've got what it takes to make some awesome designs!",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6gmu8l,,,,,,,,,,,1497254897.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499274535.0,,,

I like the blue shirt photo the best of the three you have, I would definitely make that your profile pic for now and get rid of the mirror selfie. I'm loving your  glasses. Once I set my phone to record video and just kind of moved around slowly outside in places that looked nice, then ran through the video looking for a good place to screenshot for a photo. There are workarounds for not having a photographer while you wait for more photo opportunities.

I would start with DIY or Animal Whisperer over Car Guy. People are way more likely to be positive or neutral to those than cars. Even if I don't make stuff and don't care about animals, neither of those is gonna push people away like an emphasis on cars will.

The ""what I'm doing"" is a bit too five-year-plan corporate sounding. Like the ""working contract while using corporate resources to get certificates"" literally sounds like you copied it from your resume. ""Right now I'm working as a Technical Project Manager and working on more IT certifications. I get to do cool stuff like X and Y, and I've been really enjoying it. I'm hoping to be able to get enough experience here to move up in the field"" or something similar would be more conversational. Add other interests. Do you want to learn to swing dance? Do you want to find places to practice your Spanish? Are you in the middle of a big non-car project?

Unless you are ONLY interested in women who love cars, get rid of the long specific car stories. ""I like working on my DIY skills. I've helped my friends repair their cars, fixed up some Goodwill furniture to be nice and new, and I also once built a birdhouse that an actual bird moved into. Impressive, I know."" Or whatever other projects you've done. 

Steven Universe! You can message me about that all day long. I like this section since you have so many things that could spark interest. The grammar of your parenthesis/punctuation for SU is awkward so I might fix that or get rid of the justification all together. In your music section, I like that you both describe the type of things you like as well as listing specifics.

The 'thinking about' section is a little heavy. I don't want to be sad/angry about the Paris Agreement right now, I want to think you're cute and talk about how Garnet is the best mom.

The cars noooooooooooooooo. I genuinely feel like you would not want me to message you since I don't care about cars. Again, shorter and less specific. ""I'm really interested by automotive backstories. If you let me tell you about the Ford vs Ferrari rivalry, I promise I'll pay for as much alcohol as it takes you to get through it.""  

So many things have happened on TV I just HAVE to tell someone about! SU is the BEST. How did you know I only like hot chocolate, when everyone else tries to take me to tea/coffee? I would love to make 90% of our long drive playlists Disney songs and 90s pop. There is a ton that's awesome about your essays.

I'm aware that this may be balanced but that doesn't quite make it interesting. Which is what I'm really after. CoHO was imbalanced as hell but it maintained high action in 1v1.


CoH 2 is definetly way better now than it ever was. I'm glad to see all the improvements and there are many things which I really like idea wise.

Search Light Half Track? Neato! Bulldozer Sherman that creates a 'dirt wall'? Awesome! Tons of different units.


I went and checked out the first video in the playlist ( And this is what I do a lot when I check in with the game ). I flicked to an early random point in the video ( which was 17 minutes in this game ) and this is what I tend to see;

Blobbing is a valid tactic in circumstances and I can see in this circumstance Barton can't field much of a force to counter a small blob. But...damn!

Alright. Take 2! http://i.imgur.com/n418Ha9.png


Well. 3 is hardly a blob but even so. This doesn't look tactical. This reminds me of Starcraft play =( I'm use to seeing units behind walls and in cover shooting at each other then 'wave' pushing from high level players. This doesn't look high level.

What do *you* want out of destiny?

If you just want to play with some friends and have a good time, then you should probably just do what they are doing (decrypt your engrams as you go). Once you reach level 40, your leveling progress will slow down (at 40, 'leveling' is about raising your Light Level, not your character level, which is stuck at 40 max). As you get close to 400 Light Level (max), your levelling progress will slow down again. the game is designed this way. hoarding your engrams will help you get past the slowest part of the game in order to reach  max level quickly. but if your friends aren't doing the same thing as you, you're going to be behind them for some of the game, and then you'll shoot ahead of them. you'll be ready for ""end game"" content before them, and that might not be what you want.

If you LOVE min/maxing, if you LOVE theorycrafting, pushing your efficiency to the limits in theory and then acting it out, then you should be saving your blue, purple, and yellow engrams. as you play through the campaign, you will find more than enough gear to keep you at an appropriate level without decrypting anything up until level 40 (I made a new account one month ago, and managed to do this just fine, yes your vault gets pretty full).

If you want to get to max Light Level as quickly as possible so that you can do the end game raiding content with a six man fire team, then you should save as many blue engrams as you can until you are close to 385 (blue engrams will not decrypt into anything higher than LL385, so ideally, you'd cash in your blue engrams one at a time, equipping the newly decrypted gear, and slowly push yourself to 385), then once you hit 385, start decrypting your purples (they'll help push you from 385 to 390, as purple max out at 390). Once you hit 390 you are pretty much at a high enough LL to start raiding (theres some gear you should acquire from quests, but your LL is high enough so at this point you are no longer just looking for ""any gear with higher LL"" which is sort of what you are doing up until you hit 390-400). You can get to 400 without raiding, but it takes some time.

edit: if you want to walk an efficient middle ground without stressing too much about saving loot, save your engrams until you hit 40. make sure you finish the Pretender to the Throne quest chain, as you get a sweet 320 sword called the dreadfang (I was only like 250 light when I got it, so it was a huge boost). then, decrypt what you need to so that you are eligible for the Rise of Iron missions. as someone else mentioned, completing them gets you a guaranteed set of 320 LL gear. from there, you can decrypt your engrams, and likely be eligible for the ""pre-endgame"" activities, the activities you need to do to get yourself ready to raid (this includes the Siva Heroic Strike playlist, the Nightfall, and the Weekly Story Mission playlists, among other things. these activities reward Legendary Marks, which allow you to purchase 380 LL gear from vendors. these activities also drop blue gear that can go up to 390 and legendary engrams which gets you gear up to 390 when decrypted. if you want to know what LL you need to be for each of the 'pre-endgame' activities, they're available in the bottom left corner of the director)

edit 2: also, if you're on ps4 and want someone to help you with the ROI missions, send me a friend request (Sephiros1990) and we'll get you through them in an hour or so. I think an xbox user also volunteered to do this, so we've got you covered on both consoles. cmon, don't you want to feel smug and superior when your friends get on and you're much higher than them? :P",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6gfel3,,,,,,,,,,,1497111397.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499230273.0,,,

Global Events, previously referenced by their working title of Seasons, are designed to give a jolt to the open world of The Division by offering a new way to experience post-Green Poison NYC. These events take place in the PvE world at the end game level of play.It is important to note something here:Everything you’ll see and read here is still very much a work in progress, pending a successful PTS round. Please keep this in mind, and provide any feedback you have via our official forums.Modifiers and MoreThese Global Modifiers also will be linked to events and stories that are happening in New York, providing an extra layer of lore to the player.Aside from the global modifier, separate custom modifiers are available to tailor the Global Event experience to your liking. These custom modifiers are available only on a special Global Event Playlist that will contain not only main missions, but also Incursions!Choose from a set of Activity Modifiers to put your own preferred twist on the Global Event or a set of Group Modifiers to test your squad’s teamwork and cooperation. There are some quick distinctions to be made between the three major types of modifiers in the Global Events.Tokens, Caches, Cosmetics, and More!Tokens can be earned across all Global Event activity sessions, both player modified and unmodified. These tokens can be used in our new Global Event vendor to purchase sealed caches containing some new elements to The Division world. Unique Vanity items will be created to reward players during these Global Events, and we’ll have more news on the various other new rewards in the coming weeks.Global ModifiersThe Global Modifiers, or the event itself, are always going to be a positive modifier that is specifically designed to assist the player in the game world. These can be an aid to the player as well as a source of new experiences, and should help any players struggling with a specific piece of content not only complete it, but complete it in a new and interesting way.Group ModifiersAnd finally, Group Modifiers. These specific modifiers are the next step in the evolution of the Activity Modifier. They retain the positive element of the Global Modifier, the extra challenge of the Activity modifier, and add an extra layer of group required tactics to the mix. These will require some coordination and teamwork, but the benefit is BIG.Activity ModifiersActivity Modifiers on the other hand are not only positive to the agent, they also add a slight challenge on top to push the player to a new height. Think of them as something that will work in tandem with a Global modifier to bring you the same bonus, but at a slight cost.Similar to how Underground Directives work, these modifiers, as well as the World Tier you’re playing within will earn you more Tokens.Currently, Global Events are planned to run once a month, for one full week. The team will be using the time between Global Events to run more of our Double Reward style weekend events to create a full calendar of activities for the faithful agents of The Division.Stay tuned for more information in the coming weeks that will highlight our new cosmetic items, gear, and more!/The Division Dev Team

I also post seasons of other forms of racing which choose to make their content open and freely available via YouTube. Other playlists include history, background, and add context. Once you know the people and personalities, racing is a wonderful sport to follow and you can almost predict how the drivers will behave.

If you aren't sure where to start, [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLr3mDENK7PyiDW_EpnJ_cJGk7BqFhhntN) at the first race of the year the Australian Grand Prix 2017 is a good place to start. It sums up last year's race, goes into the season changes for 2017, then highlights leading up to the race. So far I've made playlists for races 01-06 with race 07 being this weekend. Happy trails and hope you enjoy.

TLDR - Think of NASCAR as pushing the limit of speed with little downforce and minimal technology, they want the driver to be the decider. IndyCar similarly as a ""level playing field"" with incredible futuristic technology shared between all the drivers, the major differentiator being the driver themselves. And F1 as *BLEEDING EDGE* machines with zero caps on spending and a funding level *per team* that can be greater than the funding of all NASCAR teams combined. It is **intentionally** not fair in order to stretch the limits of technology. F1 is about the driver, their funding, and their team performing as a single unit. Also I shamelessly plug my subreddit because I enjoy sharing my love for the sport.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6g1slb,,,,,,,,,,,1496950221.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499180012.0,,,

Assuming you haven't discovered life or intelligent life on any other planet up until this point. 

Once you have gotten a fraction of the way to type 3, i.e: colonized a few local systems which are separated by a few hundred light-years you have pretty much ensured your entire species survival barring a situation in which some intelligent alien race comes and systematically wipes out your race system by system. 

If you assume that there are no ways around certain rigid universal laws or at least none which make sense to implement (i.e: the speed of light, sure you can warp space-time with a directional gravitational field or travel through still unproven wormholes, but how feasibly can that be implemented) 

Combine these limits with ever increasing computational power, and I feel like at a certain point, instead of combating the laws of the universe and looking outwards, civilizations will instead look inwards and perhaps content themselves with simulations of reality in which physical laws aren't so constraining. In these simulations individuals can live out whatever sort of life they desire for all eternity as part of some massive collective cybernetic hive-mind.

I know it doesn't sound pleasant but if you think about it, it would be completely indistinguishable from real life (or it could be pretty distinct from real life, but you would accept it as reality because it would be the only reality you know or remember.) You could have your memory wiped between lives and set yourself on a sequence of lives so you wouldn't even know you were in a simulation until after you played out all those lives. Assuming you were constrained by the limits of the human brain (unlikely by this stage of development.) you would live out each life in real time, but if you weren't then each one could be lived out much faster allowing you to experience a near infinite amount of things in a finite amount of time. Instead of variety, one might instead opt to just live out a set playlist of ones favorite things forever while wiping ones memory between each experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6g07ha,,,,,,,,,,,1496945569.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499177834.0,,,

t5_2se24,,,,False,,,,,,,Earwolf,,,,,,dimoyaz,,,0,,,,DarkeSword,,,t3_6fhepk,34,,,,,,"I've been a Howl subscriber since day one. The day it was announced, I signed up. I've been using the Howl app since then, and while I know it had its issues, as an iOS user I generally had an okay experience with it. I liked the discoverability of new shows that I couldn't get if I was using the RSS feeds in something like Overcast. I downloaded the Howl update today and figured ""Alright, let's give Stitcher a shot."" But I'm going to be real with you: the Stitcher app, from a UX/UI point-of-view, is absolutely, *categorically* terrible.

Here are my big takeaways after only a few hours of using it.

* The way the Front Page lists episodes is way too big. One episode fills the entirety of the screen, and it's not useful information; it's the podcast's cover art. I don't need to see that when browsing my recent episodes. Howl's app does this much better: in my favorites tab, about 5 of the most recent episodes fit on the screen.

* Playlist views only show the most recent episode of a series, completely ignoring listened status. I'm looking at my Howl Favorites list right now, and it's asking me to listen to Episode 5 of *Pen Pals*. I haven't listened to Episode 2 yet! Playlists should give the option of showing the oldest unheard episode first. The ""oldest first"" sort option that's already present doesn't do that; it arranges all the series by the oldest newest episode in each series. How does this make any kind of sense?

* There's no way to make a playlist of episodes. You can only make a playlist of series. In Howl I can create a playlist of only the movies from Black List Table Reads. I can't do that in Stitcher; I can only add the entire Black List Table Reads series to a playlist. The Listen Later playlist is episode based, but that's one playlist. I should be able to add different episodes to different playlists. Episodes, not whole series.

* There are no sorting or filtering options when viewing a series. I can't hide Heard episodes. I can't change the sort order to Oldest First. This is bad for a service like Stitcher Premium, which is trying to push *serialized, episodic content*. If you open up a tv show on Netflix, is it ""newest first?"" No. I'm not saying change the default, I'm saying make the options available.

* My listening history didn't transfer over properly from Howl; some of it did, some of it didn't, so now I'm stuck having to manually mark hundreds of shows as heard. This wouldn't be so bad if there was a batch option (like ""Mark series as heard"") but there isn't. Also, you can't swipe an episode to the side to mark it heard; you have to long press—LONG PRESS!—the play button. And then a confirm dialog pops up? What? Seriously guys? When's the last time Stitcher's UI was updated? We don't long press anymore.

I would **like** to use the Stitcher app for Earwolf content because that would be the app that would be getting continuous updates/upgrades. That would be the place to discover new shows, and I like how it also features a ton of content I listen to that I can't get inside the Howl app. But you guys are not making it easy.

I'm going to stick with the Howl app, I think, until most of these issues are fixed. The Stitcher app is just too frustrating to use right now.",,,,Red,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6fhepk,,,,,,,,,That's your diet,,1496935451.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499172937.0,,,

My favorite forest memory is from 2015. 

So one morning I decided to make it to yoga. I heard a lot of people endorsing it in the past, and having integrated yoga into my personal life I decided to give it a go. 

So a little before noon I went and got in line to make the iconic zigzag up to the gates. Once I got to tripole, I laid my mat out and was feeling a little nervous/self conscious. I had never practiced yoga in public, let alone around hundreds of people! 

For those who don't know, Hannah Muse leads yoga every year. She began the practice nice and slow, which is so wonderful after a long day an night of dancing a grooving our bodies away. Up to this point she was leading the practice only verbally. 

As we pushed back into downward dog, I heard the most beautiful piano melody and suddenly a wave of emotion swept through my body. Tears of joy began hitting the mat below my head. It took me second to realize what was occurring. Hannah had started her playlist and the first song was my favorite song, [Better Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2FuzyeO9UQ&amp;list=PLrETc4XXNqN_w6t3nti9IcN5xDeA9ydq3&amp;index=2) by STS9. This was the first song I heard from Tribe back in 2008 and is a symbol of me getting through some tough times in my life. 

As we flowed through the yoga postures all tension released from my body and mind. It was a beautiful sunny day, with beautiful people and souls, at one of the greatest places on earth. I left yoga that morning blissed out, floating a foot off the ground, literally high on life.

I later learned that Hannah Muse is married to Jeffrey Lerner, the percussionist of STS9. Since then yoga with Hannah is one of the things I look forward to most at forest every year - as well as  practicing yoga with her in Denver when STS9 plays their annual Red Rocks shows.    

Thanks for listening and Happy Forest! :)

You should DEFINITELY do it! I was fortunate enough to have my roommate (a very seasoned marathoner, she just did her 14th one in 4 years this weekend) as a trainer. 

Basically when I started with her I had built my stamina up to do 3 miles without stopping. But before then, and the advice I kept when adding distance, is to just keep going. Even when you feel like stopping, try to at least slowly jog to keep your heart rate up because that is what'll give you stamina. Once you can run one mile without stopping, push it to 2 miles, then once you can do 2 push it to 3, and so on. If you're going to run a longer race than a 5K, I personally saved my long runs for weekends and never ran longer than 6 miles a day during my mid-week training just for recovery and all that. Along with that, having a good playlist (or audiobook if you like!) to run to really helps. I'm not sure if you have any experience with music, but keeping a steady tempo of breathing is what will help you maintain stamina (I kept a rate of in, 2, 3, out, 2, 3 if that makes any sense). If you breathe too quickly, your body will run out of energy sooner than you need it to. Also, and this was one of the most important things I learned, is how to listen to your body as far as knowing when to push yourself &amp; when you're really hurt and need to stop. It sounds simple, but it took a while to learn the difference between ""my side hurts because I'm not breathing right"" and ""something is really wrong and I need to stop"".

Sorry for the tangent, I hope this helped some! Best of luck in your running endeavors!",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6fxa3s,,,,,,,,,,,1496883024.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499157362.0,,,
t5_2u5kl,,,,1496872964,,,,,,,Overwatch,,,,,,diljoqw,,,0,,,,kenshin13850,,,t1_dil1xrk,1,,,,,,"I highly recommend [Skyline's channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDrfc_LU0llSRI7icBFoBnw/featured) too. Watch his ""solo queue school"" videos (it's a playlist, or you can just pick them out). They're VOD reviews of players that submitted their video's for coaching. He covers a lot of mistakes players make and frames his coaching to their level. It's a good series to just get awareness of what you should be doing at any given moment.

If you want to improve quickly, then you should play a semi-mechanically inclined hero and focus on the basics:

* Mechanical Aim. Most heroes need to aim to be effective. Find a sens/dpi that you're comfortable with.
* Positioning. Different roles position differently. Good positioning makes you live longer and play more effectively. It is paramount to succes.
 * Supports need to be extra safe. Stay behind your tanks. Use cover. Ask for help when you need it. 
 * DPS should be on high ground, have cover, and have a good angle (narrow field of vision, safe from flanks, threatens enemy). 
 * Tanks make space by threatening a small zone and covering it with shields/health/barriers, but they need healers to keep that space. 
 * Flankers flank the enemy and attack when they're distracted (don't initiate on your own).
* Track Ults. Use the scoreboard to see your teams ults and who is on fire on the enemy team (they'll probably have ult if they didn't use it). Ask for ult progress of your teammates.
* Don't overcommit ults. Have a plan on when to ult. Don't blow them all at once. Combo effective ults.
* Know when to push in. Generally if you get a pick, you should commit to a fight. Don't just stand at the choke and hope to kill 3 of them before committing. This is why teams struggle on 2 CP maps.
* Know when to pull out/die. If you lose a teammate before a fight, wait for them to come back. If you lose the fight, pull out or suicide off a cliff. Do not get staggered. Do not feed ult.
* Communicate. The previous 4 bullets can be managed a lot better if you talk to your team.
* Stay positive. Seriously, don't get tilted.
* If you lose two rank games in a row, take a break for an hour. This will slow the tilt.
* Having gold medals doesn't mean you're contributing.
* Stop shooting tanks if you can't kill them and have your ult so that you don't feed the enemy supports' ults.

Just focus on one thing at a time for now. Go into a game with the thought of ""I'm going to improve my positioning"". Don't worry about anything else until positioning well is second nature. Then focus on the next thing you want to learn.

As for heroes:

Easy Heroes to Learn (low skill floors) and contribute with:

* **Soldier 76 (my personal recommendation for new players)**
* Pharah
* Mercy
* Lucio
* Roadhog
* Reinhardt
* Zarya
* Mei

Easy Heroes to learn, but very situational

* Symmetra
* Torbjorn

Harder Heroes to learn (high skill floor), but can carry:

* Genji
* Tracer
* Winston

Heroes to avoid (situational by nature with other problems):

* Junkrat - Low impact, poor ability to secure kills (thus mostly feeds ults), useful for breaking shields
* Bastion - Moderate skill floor, needs protection and good game sense
* Hanzo - Very High skill floor
* Widow - Very High skill floor

The skill floor is the minimum skill required to play a hero well. Low skill floor heroes are easy to pick up. High skill floor heroes are harder to pick up. The rest of the Heroes are kind of in the middle in terms of ability to learn vs their immediate impacts. Some are harder to learn and have bigger payouts, others are easier to learn with smaller payouts.",,,,C03 R14,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6fug0o,,,,,,,,,Chibi Tracer,,1496871628.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499152998.0,,,

This is showcased by the amount of support letters Peterson has received from transgender individuals, and the fact that David, *and Bernie Sanders FFS* have all been accused of sexism/racism/whatever.

That's why David made the video *The Truth About the Regressive Left*, because there are real issues on the left as well, ones that will cost elections if left unchecked.

What do you say when protesters are at Peterson's events with a hammer and sickle banner? Is it radical or conspiratorial to say they're Marxists?

I will concede that he does come off sounding conspiratorial, but it's grounded in reality and you can see that for yourself on youtube. What he's actually saying is much, much more nuanced and complicated than some conspiratorial nonsense. (I used to debate 9/11 Truthers, a lot, so I would know.) And he readily admits that the current system isn't perfect. His issue is mainly with the activists, especially those who silence people - the sort of thing we saw at Berkeley. Even on the pronoun issue he has said it's almost entirely besides the point, compelled speech and the silencing of opposition are the issues at hand. You can see the tactics they use, which he lays out in his lectures, play out in the real world exactly.

He outlines the problem much more clearly in his lectures than in the interview with David. I've watched his whole Maps of Meaning playlist over the course of this spring, it's quite a fantastic look into mythology, religion and philosophy, and its significance in the modern world, (Especially towards the end.) and I say this as an atheist.",,,,finland,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6ff6t5,,,,,,,,,,,1496862807.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499148995.0,,,

Other degrees are more engineering-focused and may require calc 1-4 and differential equations. Others are more theory-based and may push more pure-math classes like analysis or abstract algebra. If you aren't doing CS or engineering you may stop at calc 1 and stats. So it all depends on the coursework you are planning to take.

I push through everything I come across, from the charts to the indie stuff, and I've found quite a few gems because of it. Songs and artists that might never make it out of the decade, as well as those that faded into oblivion years ago.

An example: The band, [Colibrium.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-khGlxVQNh0) They're not very well known at all, but their music is pretty good, if you don't mind that genre. Not the best, by any means, but still. I feel they've gained some hefty traction since I discovered them (I dunno why that video only has 2400 views. It was over 100,000, last I saw). Not enough to make 'em anywhere near mainstream, but I feel that if any of the lesser-known artists I'm familiar with are going to reach mainstream status at any point in the future, it'll be these guys.

Another is The Quadbox, or, more specifically, their song, [Belittled.](https://youtu.be/vRLyURQA0r0?t=6s) They're not as recent as Colibrium, and didn't get any real traction, from what I could tell. They didn't have a label, I'm pretty sure. They were as indie as a band could get (and it unfortunately really shows in the production quality, but I've heard much, *much* worse). They only released a handful of songs before disappearing (not all of them are on that channel). Again, not the best, by any means, but I feel that at least this song deserves its place in my general playlist. It's always a little depressing when an artist pops up with some songs I enjoy, and then they just kinda fade away, but that's the music business, I guess.

Maladaptive Daydreamers don't actually do this, it's a big red flag that he may have something else going on.  At any rate he's welcome here and we'll do our best to be helpful and supportive, he's definitely not alone.  It sounds like he might be talking about a parasocial relationship? Maybe give that a google and see if it fits.

I've been with my SO for a decade and only told them about the MD last year, so 11 months after a lifetime of hiding and secrecy seems like a good sign, that he's comfortable talking to you.

So, coming from the MD side of this all I really know how to do is tell you what pisses me of about how SO reacts to MD... 

Poking fun- You might think its just light jabbing, and that it's even a good thing to be able to joke with each other about it, and sure, it can be, but be careful, sharing the DDs with someone puts us in an extremely vulnerable position. There's a deep aspect of secrecy and feelings of shame and doubt, if I were him I'd still be doubting if telling you at all was a good idea.  I don't know where the line is for you guys, but maybe let him know it's ok to say ""uhhh, it kinda bugs me when you 'smirk knowingly' and wink at me every time someone mentions Celebrity.""

Or something like this ""Well, you must be doing better because I haven't noticed too much negative impact on your life."".... I've been MDing longer than you've been alive, SO! We're damn good at hiding it, and even when we're not it just looks like cute personality quirks.  My love of goofball playlists crafted by my besties is endearing, but what it really is is a compulsive and obsessive NEED to enhance the daydream state and I WILL listen to the same 8 second clip 64 times to get the DD just right, and I don't even know who sings the damn song.  

Attributing things to the DD which have nothing to do with it.  ""You did the Thing?! I told you not to, you didn't hear me because you were probably off in your world, you NEED to pay more attention when I'm talking to you about stuff!""... no... I just forgot, you said that weeks ago, gtf over it.

Over analysis of the DD... maybe you feel inadequate and that's why you dream of being loved by powerful people.  Maybe. Maybe not.  I get that you're trying to help but just... don't... Half of the talking about it is more like venting, or catharsis, after keeping it to yourself for years its... thrilling... just to tell someone something about it, take it at face value and don't think too deep about it unless he's asking for help or an opinion.

Why don't you write it down?  My god how we try! We use literary terms to describe the DDs a lot, but they're not at all like coherent story lines, and art is a skill which takes a lot of time and dedication and attention to get good at... we have a hard time finishing loading the dishwasher.  Some do, and if he wants to definitely be supportive, but pushing leads to frustration.

That's kind of all I can think of, sorry if it's difficult to read or contradictory.

And to him, yeah, therapy is a good idea, lots of therapists haven't heard of MD, so go in prepared, bring copies of the research if you need to. You'll want to probably address the underlying cause first since it will just keep feeding the MD.  You've sort of hardwired your brain to be set to daydream at any opportunity, so any chance you get to break up that habit will help little by little.

Firstly, try not to skip your classes! I used to skip the odd class if I felt like my anxiety was bad that day, but it was such a vicious cycle because I would fall behind and get even *more* anxious. Then I'd start to worry about irrational things, like not wanting to show up for my next class because I'm worried the lecturer will say something to me about my absence. Just show up, even if your mind isn't 100% in it. If anything, it will just help your mind get into the routine of being there.

You could also try to find some things that can help calm yourself down in between your studies. Do you have any stress relieving hobbies? Gaming, catching up with friends, reading a book? For me, it's going for a run. I just run and run until my body is exhausted and I have no energy to overthink and worry anymore.

Even if you don't have time for any hobbies like that, you could try to find ways to let your mind calm down a bit. For example, I currently work and study full time so am pretty time poor, but I have a chill playlist that I listen to while on the bus to and from work and uni. During that time, I don't allow myself to think about work or uni related things because that's my chill time. It's difficult, but I've slowly trained myself to compartmentalise my anxious thoughts.

And, of course, seek out professional help if you are not already doing so. Consider seeking out a counsellor/psychologist (my uni has free resources for students - your college may too). And reach out to friends and family for their support too.

Good luck to you, both with your studies and managing the anxiety :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6fk4bj,,,,,,,,,,,1496748003.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499107115.0,,,

Unfortunately, I'm still in the market for a replacement music management system as well, but partly because I now have a lot of music that's only part of my GPM subscription, in addition to music that's not on any subscription. I haven't found many good options for streaming your own music, but they've all been more in the DIY direction (don't remember any names, sorry), which it doesn't seem like you're too interested in.

I use GPM for both my own music as well as the paid subscription, and regardless of whose music you're listening to or whether or not it's downloaded, Google still tries to push their recommended music in the app. I only have ~30GB of music though so it's easy to keep it all downloaded through GPM with a 64GB phone, and once everything you want is downloaded, you gain some extra flexibility.

This is probably your easiest solution:

1. Buy &amp; insert 128GB+ microSD card
2. Use the GPM app to download all your music. I don't have an SD card so I can't check, but I'm pretty sure you can set it as the download destination in settings. (It's easiest to download your music it if its in playlists, otherwise you have to download each artist/album at a time.)
3. Pull out the side menu and flip the switch for ""Downloaded Only"" and then anything that requires internet disappears (all of their recommendations), and all that's left is whatever you have downloaded.

I'm always in full internet mode, so I can't be certain, but I'm pretty sure that as long as Google Play Services can still sync, it will update your playlists with any changes, which will then download the missing/new songs. If not, flipping the switch back for it to sync is all you'd have to do.

Edit: I see you say you listen to the stations sometimes. You can download those too, so that they show up with all of your own downloaded music, at least with a paid subscription (I'm not familiar with the free tier's radio limitations, maybe it will download audio ads with the playlist?).",,,,dev,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6fejtm,,,,,,,,,Nexus 6P,,1496704404.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499094775.0,,,

I imagine the fundamentals of the core are not able to be configured in a way that would distinguish damage dealt by player. 

If you think about it, Halo Warzone is still a Beta. Despite being the largest maps and playlist, the current released version of warzone is the first and only wide release. Microsoft had to push H5's release and as such the playlist seems untested. (On the original 3 maps, the bases are carbon copies of one another - Bosses spawn in the same place and same time, etc.) In order to fix seemingly simple problems such as damage dealt at core, a new version of warzone would need to be made.

I love warzone, but it is flawed in various ways. As such, I am more excited for what comes next. The next version of warzone, I hope, will be a refined masterpiece of the beta we still endure today.

t5_2ts0y,,,,False,,,,,,,NinjaSexParty,,,,,,dih193i,,,0,,,,RushBoingo,,,t1_digfn2l,1,,,,,,"My least favourite Ninja Sex Party song is I Just Wanna (Dance). It's a bit clunky music wise, with Brian clearly still developing his mastering skills on Logic (their music editor), and more notably was their very first foray into music videos, with that in mind, they decided to make a new song based on visual comedy for it, which makes it as a song, kind of fail, since there really isn't one funny line in the song without the visual gag to accompany it. Most importantly, if someone listened to it on CD or Spoofy first, they would find no humor in it (IMO).

There is one other song by NSP I'm not a big fan of musically, which is Samurai Abstinence Patrol. I like the comedy in it fine, but musically it feels like a unofficial sequel to the much superior Rhynoceratops VS SuperPuma, and in general the backing music track and melodies in it don't really have the catchy click I instantly get from other NSP songs.

Beyond those two, I really do love all of them in some way or another.

As for Starbomb...I skip Kirby in Reamland often. I have issues with that one. This was written before Starbomb was even a thing, so the backing track is very basic for Arin to Rap over, and Arin's  raps themselves are just kinda cringeworthy to me on it. Meanwhile, Danny has a very pushed back presence in the song which hurts it too. There are other starbomb songs where I find Arin's raps a bit cringy too, but they are generally saved by good humor, and or good contributions from Danny and Brian. I feel luckily validated in not liking Kirby in Reamland, since Brian himself said in his before the grumps interview that its probably the worst song Starbomb has ever done. 

I do get the Cookies criticism, since its in that weird realm of being too long for an album sketch interlude, and too short to be considered (not really playlist worthy like most of the bangers on Attitude City). I actually found out a neat fact about cookies when I selfishly asked a Ninja Sex Party question at a Game Grumps VIP Q&amp;A at their show in Minneapolis last year. I particularly asked it because Brian was there (he doesn't usually go to the out of town GG live shows, but does visit family in Minnesota every year, and came to the show because why not (and he IMO was the funniest part of the night since he opened the show with what was essentially a Troll-off against Ross, and clearly won)). I asked them since 6969 took the longest for the two of them to write, what song was written the fastest, and Danny and Brian just exchanged a quick look before saying unison ""COOKIES"". They conceived, wrote, and recorded the demo in the span of 6 hours apparently, which is probably why it is so short.

Anyway, thanks for doing all this back and forth on NSP. Its fun to do the back and forth thing, rather than start a thread, and let a bunch of one-sided comments roll in. Do me a favour and message me what you thought of TWRP sometime once you listen to them. Otherwise, I look forward to chatting again as the concert draws nearer.",,,,editable,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6efxum,,,,,,,,,Insert Text Here,,1496635750.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1499073068.0,,,

When some people reach their limit in alcohol, we shut it down and stop drinking. When she breaks past a certain point, she almost loses the ability to refuse a drink. I genuinely just recognized that she was past that point.

&gt; that her friend changed the songs on your playlist (why yours and not your gf's?)

She doesn't know that much about music. She wanted me to put it together. It's a little unsettling that reddit is asking me to defend details like this.

&gt;  the thing about cooking eggs in bacon grease (very, VERY few people bother cleaning out pans in between cooking 2 types of oily food)

Cooking eggs in bacon grease isn't the most awful thing in the world. I wanted to emphasize how everything she cooks is coated in fat, which would cause someone who's trying to count calories to think that something that was 100 calories, was actually 300. Wouldn't it be frustrating to think that you're sticking to a 1300 calorie diet and not see any results because it was actually closer to 2000, but you didn't know?

&gt; and how she eats it with meat and salad that's apparently not good enough for you.

Again, you're reading into this as if I'm someone else. I pointed out that we both have our own preferences for how we diet, and I respect that. There's nothing wrong with having salads. I personally prefer to just eat dried fruit, and sliced grilled meat out of a Ziploc bag and stick to the same thing every day.

&gt; Your obsession with her weight is frankly just as disturbing as her friend's obsession with her not losing weight.

I'm not obsessed with her weight. But I definitely want her to see results *when she is committed to a diet*, and if she wants to cheat on the diet, all the power to her - but it has to be by her own choice, not someone else pushing greasy food on her, knowing full well she's trying to diet.

When I lashed out about buying the two large bags of chips, that was a mistake on my part and something I apologized for doing. Part of the problem for me is that when those foods are around my house, I end up giving into the temptation as well. I read a lot about psychology and self control, and one of the best ways to avoid giving into temptations is to not have it around you.

I am not forcing my lifestyle changes on her. I communicated completely honestly that she's allowed to live the lifestyle she wants, but that it might start to fester resentment if our lifestyles are too different. I'm not going to stop loving her if she puts on weight.

&gt; Ask her what she really wants to do and listen to her.

I ask her all the time. When she says she doesn't want to diet, I leave her alone (aside from the time with the chips, but that was an error on my part.) When she *does* want to diet, she gets upset if I don't help coach her with her diet. I help her plan her meals and all that because she honestly wants me to, and I'm very knowledgeable about what options she could have to get results while still enjoying food.

1.Announce that we're going to push out a couple updates for 343 to fix as many bugs and streamline as much as we can but let everyone know that we won't be able to completely fix the game.

2.Allow the people working on the CE nhe edition to port it to Xbox one as long as Microsoft gets the majority of the profit(the PC port was used for mcc so it doesn't really count). Possibly give them a couple people from 343 to help with assets or anything else they need.

Halo 5

1.Add oddball,assault,and king of the hill to the hcs playlist,and the rest of the game.

2.Go through the halo 5 dlc maps with pro players and ask what needs to be fixed to make them competition ready.

3.Fix warzone assault's serious problems.

4.Encourage &amp; subsidize the grassroots scene in whatever manner possible.Trying to become a pro is difficult enough without all the extra impositions there currently are.

5.Fix theater, and spectator mode.

6.These are a couple of more personal ones but unpatch the patch of fast fall,and super slide,add in a 4sk pistol that's essentially the halo 5 pistol but with even less aim assist and bullet magnetism,and throw whatever classic playlist we have in the works in the trash and use the evolved settings.

Halo 3 anniversary

1. If we haven't already started working on it
( ͡º ͜ʖ ͡º)
we are now.

Halo 6 (this is all my opinion so people may disagree.I couldn't really be objective for halo 6)

1.Reskin the CE pistol as a rifle or use a 4sk h5 pistol with less aim assist and bullet magnetism as the utility weapon.

2.Throw headshot prioritization in the trash.

3.Make sure all the power weapons that are aim dependent are really difficult to use.

4.Create a spawn system like CE's that works similarly for 2v2 and 4v4.

5.Give us a deep/skillful melee system.

6.Button combos are added in as a alternate firing mode.

7.Remove sprint,ads,and spartan charge.

8.Add air control.

9.Equipment returns as power up kind of like OS and camo.

10.AI in forge.(This is the only one I'm definitely sure of since I'm not a forge kid)

At this point I'm kind of torn because I like how big the movement skillgap is in halo 5,and removing all the spartan abilities would take that away but I think a classic style halo would be more popular.My ideal halo would keep the rest of the spartan abilities,and try to make the movement similar to halo 5's pre fast fall/super slide patch.What would probably be best is to remove all spartan abilities and focus on a 100% classic halo.

ok, so I'd argue mid is my least played and most difficult lane. because:

1) the minion wave management is a little different to the longer side-lanes. 

2) junglers can gank from literally any angle, even over tower wall or raptors wall. 

3) you're signing into taking up map-pressure duty, being in the middle of the map.

on the point of wave management. as far as I can tell, either freeze and deny/jungler gank, or push and harass (if you're stronger, enemy jungler is somewhere else, and they can't freeze) or push and roam (map pressure, assisting jungler contest or gank another lane).

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/614c4cf58070455883f1b61e68327915.png)  

&gt; Fountains of Wayne is an American power pop band that formed in 1995. The group (not to be confused with Fountains) helped spearhead the 90s power pop revival and achieved breakout mainstream success with the 2003 Gold-certified album 'Welcome Interstate Managers', which spawned the smash top 10 hit ""Stacy's Mom"". Having achieved critical acclaim throughout their career, the band consists of Adam Schlesinger, Brian Young, Chris Collingwood, and Jody Porter, last releasing 'Sky Full of Holes' in 2011.

&gt; The band's name was taken from the name of a lawn-ornament store in Wayne, New Jersey, not far from Montclair, New Jersey. That city is the hometown of the band's bassist and cofounder Adam Schlesinger (the store has since gone out of business). According to  Songfacts, there were prominent fountains there.

&gt; The concept of the band was formed by Schlesinger and Chris Collingwood. The two first met as freshmen at Williams College and began playing music together in various groups. The two eventually went their separate ways with Collingwood forming the Mercy Buckets in Boston and Schlesinger forming Ivy in New York City. The duo initially set out to work together in the early 90s under various band monikers (including ones named ""Pinwheel"" and ""The Wallflowers""), and recorded a full album's worth of demos in 1993. Although never released, the ""Pinwheel"" demos are widely bootlegged by fans and display a very different (yet still earnest) version of the pair's songwriting, though several songs from this period would be re-tooled and appear on later releases.

&gt; After failing to get their project off the ground, the two met up once again during the mid-90s and formed Fountains of Wayne. A demo eventually landed the two a deal with Atlantic Records and in 1996 they released their self titled debut. The album spawned the singles Radiation Vibe and Sink To The Bottom which received airplay, but it was Schlesinger's song entitled That Thing You Do! which became a hit being used as the lead track for the Tom Hanks film of the same name. ""That Thing You Do!"" also brought Schlesinger an Oscar nomination and an RIAA gold certification for the hit soundtrack.

&gt; Along with guitarist Jody Porter and drummer Brian Young, the band toured the world extensively behind the album playing alongside bands such as The Smashing Pumpkins and The Lemonheads.

&gt; In 1999, the band returned with their second album, Utopia Parkway, a loosely-based concept album about life in the American suburbs in the late 1990s. Unfortunately, a much-changed radio climate left little room in playlists for Fountains of Wayne's snarky power-pop, and the album, along with its three singles Denise, Red Dragon Tattoo, and Troubled Times, sank without much notice. The following year, the band was mostly quiet, contributing a song each to a soundtrack and a compilation (Too Cool for School to the ""Scary Movie"" soundtrack and California Sex Lawyer to the third installment of the International Pop Overthrow series). They were dropped by Atlantic soon thereafter.

&gt; The band spent much of the early 2000s in seclusion, occasionally rejoining to record or play an occasional gig, but mostly Schlessinger was focusing on work with Ivy and Collingwood founded an alt.country band near his Western Massachusetts home called The Gay Potatoes. In addition, the band wrote and performed the theme song to the popular Comedy Central program ""Crank Yankers,"" and contributed a cover of The Kinks ""Better Days"" to a tribute album. The song was also later featured prominently in a scene of the 2004 remake of ""The Manchurian Candidate."" During this time, the band's stature only grew in indie pop circles, raising expectations high for the release of their next album.

&gt; Welcome Interstate Managers, Fountains of Wayne's third record and first for Virgin, was released in June of 2003. Preceeded by the single and video for the Cars-ish Stacy's Mom, the song became a surprise top 20 hit on the strength of its video--a send-up of 1980s teen comedies like ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High""--which starred Rachel Hunter as Stacy's Mom. The video went into heavy rotation on MTV, pushing the album to become Fountains of Wayne's most successful with sales exceeding 400,000 units.

&gt; Like most bands who have a major hit driven by a clever video, follow-up singles did not fare as well. Despite a similarly-clever video for Mexican Wine, the single failed to take off after MTV banned the video due to a scene where two underage girls lip-synch the words to the chorus, a reference to drinking tequila. Third single Hey Julie initially made only a minor dent on AAA and Hot AC format stations, but it was later featured in ""Scrubs"" and other TV shows and grew in stature over time, becoming something of a sleeper hit. During this time, the band also wrote a series of short, almost They Might Be Giants-styled songs for a short-lived VH1 TV series titled ""Hey Joel!,"" which was written by critic Joel Stein. The show was canceled before it aired in the United States and the songs were never released.

&gt; The song named ""Red Dragon Tattoo"" was also featured in the 2004 series ""Kingdom Hospital"", based on a novel by Stephen King, that aired on BBC. 

&gt; In 2005, the band issued the 2-disc Out-of-State Plates, a compilation rounding up the band's various import-only B-sides as well as several new songs. Maureen was released as a single yet received little attention.

&gt; The band's fourth proper album, titled Traffic and Weather, was released April 3, 2007. One abandoned track from these sessions, a novelty throwaway titled Monster House that was written for the movie of the same name but not used, was leaked in advance of the album's release via the band's MySpace page. ""Traffic and Weather"" met with typically strong reviews but fewer sales than its predecessor, although the single and video for Someone to Love made a minor impact.

&gt; In early 2009, the band embarked on a small tour where they began to debut some new songs from an as-yet-untitled fifth album. Progress was slow, however, and other than some scattered shows the band dropped almost entirely out of view for two years. In late 2010, the band announced that they were now without a label but that they had completed their as-yet-untitled fifth album, which they were hoping to release sometime in 2011 once they found a new label. During this time they gave away one new free song via their website. Song of the Passaic was written for an NPR segment using a poem about New Jersey's famed, industrial Passaic River.

&gt; In May 2011, the band has announced that their fifth album, Sky Full of Holes will be released on August 1st, 2011 on Lojinx in Europe, August 2nd, 2011 on  YepRoc in North America and on Warner in Japan. Two singles were released in advance of the album itself: Richie and Ruben in May 2011, followed by Someone's Gonna Break Your Heart the following month. Like their previous releases, the album garnered critical praise from a variety of publications. Jill Menze of 'Billboard' called the release ""excellent"", describing it as ""a new minimal sound with a poppy, folk-leaning flair.""

&gt; After a six-month tour in support of the album, the band quietly went defunct in favor of side projects. Although they never officially broke up, the band has been completely inactive since sometime in 2012. Read more on Last.fm.

Op.gg works. Play.tv is another option if you have a fast internet to upload videos.
Go to your profile when loading a match on op.gg:

&gt; Now i'd like to get more guidance based on the results of my last 13 games.

Your CS is alright for low bronze. It's possible you're playing too passive and lose as a result of that. It's hard to say without a replay.

&gt; other problems like i donno how to roam and bad at managing lanes sit aside, just focus on 6-7cs/min now?

Don't worry about more complex concepts like lane management yet. Teams won't understand how to capitalize on lane management or roaming at this level of play.

In this elo your number one goal should be to gain *as much gold as you can*. You want to become an unstoppable monster. The enemy team should be afraid to even come near you because of your damage.

CS is the most consistent and easiest way to become stronger than your opponents. Understanding trading and damage potentials are core concepts you might want to master next.

Video playlist: https://youtu.be/iko2tqmDpJQ?list=PL9RdXhXESRJzgY_SwHB8T-cZxXljWhQvz

&gt; helping me a lot in learning how to manage waves.

That's great and all, but nobody in Bronze 5 will respect a proper lane freeze (nor will you or your jungler understand how to punish). Junglers will gank at random times and waste time. It's a great skill to understand, but it won't be as effective as pushing into tower and looking to gain more gold (through kills or more CS).

**Advice:** 

You have decent CS (could use a little more improvement). Next time you are meeting your CS goals, look at the scoreboard. Who do you *think* you can burst or kill? Try it out. Learn the potential of your champion (Annie/Swain) at various stages of the game. Once you learn how strong you are vs the enemy, you can more easily punish the enemy.

If you all in and die. You'll still learn something (e.g. anticipate where the jungler is before an all-in).

Me being the one with the password always had to go to the back to turn the playlist off, and even though we always would laugh it off, I was always really damn nervous going back to the office by myself 

I always thought maybe Toby was offended we didn't play the stores playlist and hated the music we listened to ",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6eo57p,,,,,,,,,,,1496351789.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1498986998.0,,,

Even if there's no music playing, just the act of having them on is like a comforter, because it sends 'don't talk to me' signals to whoever's walking. I also make sure I have my phone to fidget with like a radio app or playlist or something to look up (news, etc.) if people see that you're otherwise occupied you blend into the crowd or just another one of those music-listening-to young people (depending on where you live of course). Anyway, I know this may sound out of your depth so I don't want to push you, but that's what worked for me regarding going outside. 

As for the doctor, I found [this](https://vsee.com/online-doctor-consultation/) website from a quick google search that offers a list of online doctor services, and there's a whole bunch of others if you google online doctors, I dunno if that's an option but maybe? I also found this [https://firstopinionapp.com/](https://firstopinionapp.com/) where apparently you can message a doctor for free (depending on which state you live in), so I don't know if you'd want to check that out as well, or other online/over the phone consultation services. 

I don't know if you're getting enough nutrition either, and I don't know if this is a problem or unrelated but if you're having trouble eating or losing weight easily try some calorie replacement shakes? I don't know - just if you're eating healthily and you're losing weight or not maintaining it it might be you're either burning too much from anxiety/something else or eating healthily means not getting enough calories. I don't know, again, but maybe you could ask your Mom to bring you like a bulk pack of protein power or nutritional shakes...or ingredients for peanut butter milkshakes/smoothies (if you're into that stuff) I'm sorry I can't be of more help or this doesn't apply but please hang in there and try to get healthy because I've been where you are and it's very hard so my heart goes out to you and how challenging this is.

RL Grime - 10/10, 9/10, 7/10 - Saw him twice in 2015 and once in 2016, lots of variation in sets between mid 2015 and end of 2015, but his set in mid 2016 was quite similar to the last one I'd seen.

Quix - 10/10 - A beast on the decks, has a style of music nobody else does, never recycles sets from what I've seen

WSN - 6/10 second time mid 2015, 9/10 mid 2016, was rolling too hard to remember him when I first saw him in 2014

Skrillex - 10/10 - A god, what else can you say

Troyboi - 7/10 festival set, 5/10 Mantra tour - song selection at his festival set was generally good but yah poor mixing

Ekali - 9/10, extremely good.

Marshmello - 2/10 mid 2016, 3/10 early 2017, give him a miss unless you really like his brand of bubblegum trap.

Jack U - 5/10 mid 2016, very disappointing, big fan of their work but they just mashed up a bunch of festival trap songs with pop rap songs even if they didn't work together, Skrillex solo was sooo much better. 

GTA - 9/10, heard bad things about their festival sets being very generic but saw them headline a solo show of theirs in a small club and they THREW DOWN, played all their trap bangers and they have a lot of those. 

Snails - 8/10, plays the same set every festival but very fun the first time.

Flume - 2/10, controversial I know but thought his Skin tour was so overhyped, visuals were amazing but performance wise he may as well have pushed play on a spotify playlist of his songs, all of them played out completely and faded into the next song. Would prefer to be able to dance when I attend shows also, and his music is not very dancey at all. 

Major Lazer - 4/10, too much time on the mic, some is fine but not if you're just too lazy to mix.

Gladiator - 9/10, top lads and played a great fucking set also.

Sam Gellaitry - 3/10, was the ultimate disappointment as a huge fan of his music, seemed like he just mixed Escapism II, he was in the opening slot of a festival though so maybe it was deliberate to keep it very low energy but I left disappointed.

Slumberjack - 6/10, standard festival set

Other non-trap artists:

Drezo - 8/10

Destructo - 10/10, why is this guy not more popular, I feel like trap has peaked and house is rising again and if he released Party Up today it would be bigger than it was.

Zedd - 9/10, like Snails he plays the same set every festival but the first time its amazing. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6efvru,,,,,,,,,,,1496275363.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1498961770.0,,,

t5_2tbyb,,,,False,,,,,,,Mountaineering,,,,,,diabclj,,,0,,,,CruxMantle,,,t3_6cvdc9,2,,,,,,"Ok here are some practical things to think about primarily related to comfort and conservation of energy, in no particular order:

-Absolutely Get yourself a giant piss bottle, specifically the collapsible 96oz Nalgene. You will piss more often, which will help sleep warmer. A tiny piss bottle just sucks. 

-Bring a crazy creek chair so you can sit up in your tent in the evening or during downtime. You will spend a shit load of time doing nothing in your tent waiting out storms, rest days etc. The weight penalty is minimal for hours and hours of comfort you will have and the positive psychological boost you'll get. I even brought the long back version and would do it again in a heart beat. You won't bring this to high camp. You can even use this as a substitute for a closed cell foam pad to pair with an inflatable, in which case there is no weight penalty.

-Use a sleep mask at night to deal with the lack of darkness on the mountain. I thought this was a stupid gear choice for me initially because I never used one, but after the first night on the glacier, I was totally sold. Ear plugs are also a good idea.

-Be lazy. And by that I mean do not bust your ass when breaking down and setting up camp. You will be doing that multiple times and it takes several hours and can wear you out if you run around like a fucking madman and don't take any breaks. Shoveling snow and building walls, hauling snow bricks in sleds and digging and burying your cache will sap your energy quickly, especially as you get past 10K in elevation. Take it easy, work slowly and methodically, stop and take a break, shoot the shit for a few minutes, even if you are feeling strong. Do your fair share but dial it back, way the fuck back. Don't be a hero, give up the shovel to someone else, grab some water. On very tough, long travel days you will roll into camp exhausted, but then you still have to build camp. Be especially prudent about conserving energy right after a big effort. Even more important as you gain altitude and are trying to acclimate. If you are getting out of breath you are working too hard. 

-Utilize the Rest Step. I saw very few if any climbers using a proper rest step. Utilize it down low and on any incline you travel across. You will conserve energy in the long run. Your legs will be fresher and you will have a shorter recovery time, but you must utilize it at all times, not just when you are feeling tired, or pulling a stupidly heavy load up hill. Shorten your stride as well. Squirrel Hill, Autobahn, Pig Hill, these are all areas where you should be utilizing a rest step. Practice it and focus on economy of movement.

-Bring some sort of small disc frisbee so you can play golf (trekking poles and wands are used as the ""holes""). Games are critical to mixing things up, especially when it feels like the hours are dragging on and on. A disc frisbee weighs nothing.

-Bring a small AM/FM radio. Something that runs on AAA batteries is perfect as you can get could reception even at high camp. The Sony ICFS10 is a good choice. The radio really helps on those long, drawn out days, when you are sitting around with your thumb up your ass and don't feel like replaying your ipod playlist again.

-Write in the rain journal and ball point pen. The ball point won't freeze. The journal is a good way to kill time. It was a nightly ritual in my tent. It is also relaxing and helps you settle into a routine.

-Make a detailed gear list. Many mistakes can be stopped ahead of time as you are planning your trip. List out every single item you plan on bringing down to the last q-tip. Weigh everything. This helps you make decisions better on what to bring and what to leave. 

-Stuff sacks. Bring a lighweight compression sack for your sleeping bag. No need for the fancy eVent ones. Bring a smallish one for your spoon, cup and fairshare mug. It's not cool using a snow stake as a ""spoon"" if you lose yours. Bring two other small ones, one for personal hygiene items and one for electronics (camera, phone, battery bank, cables, spare batteries, radio, etc. For those two bags I like the Outdoor Research Zip sacks. This was my system. Everything else gets stuffed into the backpack, or sled bag.

-Sled Bag. Do not get a heavy ass sled bag. Go as light as possible. I used the Outdoor Products Mammoth Duffle. The stupidly bulky and heavy sled bags I saw many climbers use was mind boggling. Long and narrow sled bags work best. They do not have to be waterproof. 

-Be smart about dividing up the load between pack and sled at different points on the mountain. You will figure this out, but some people won't. 

-Rest on the fixed lines. There will be many, many times on the fixed lines where you will be stopped. You should relax and put your weight on your ascender, not your legs. This will give you a break. You should think of it as literally hanging out. And don't forget to turn around and take in the view.

-Bring a small paperback book to read or put stuff on your phone, PDF's etc.

-Bring a battery bank so you can charge your phone, etc. The Nektech 6000 has a built in solar panel and works great.

-Shave a little weight by bringing lightweight carabiners. No need for a giant RocLock, when a Vaporlock will get the job done. Also don't bring a big bulky harness. The BD Couloir is a good choice.

Overall, adapting to glacier life seems to be one of the biggest challenges on an expedition like Denali. I saw some climbers struggle in this regard. Take care of your body, eat, rest, and hydrate. Look after your feet every night, let them air out and bring toe nail clippers as well. Bring a couple of jokes you can share, be cool to other climbers, and remember that everyone will get pissed or grumpy at some point, so just let that shit roll right off you. The psychological highs and lows will be related to the weather, which dictates when you move and when you don't. When you aren't moving, that's when things get tough. Patience is key and keeping a zero expectation attitude is critical. Identify goals ahead of time other than making the summit as a way to measure your success. For me it was, making sure all my systems were 100% fucking bang on. Layering, glove, face, climbing, footwear, pack organization, being organized inside the tent, sled rigging, rope work, etc. A big part of my training was dialing in all my systems and having no doubt about what I was bringing and how it was going to work with my other gear choices. On a trip like this honing your camp craft skills ahead of time is key, but there is also ample time to learn new things from others. I came back with several new tricks. Finally, be prepared to push through the inevitable low point during your trip.

Bleak, beautiful, moving. If you like atmoblack this demo doesn't bring anything new to the table, but it offers focus — with only guitar and drums, there are no tricks or flashing lights; just the very efficient use of riffing and drumming to create magnificent soundscapes. Instrumental albums frequently lose me very fast, but Ungesehen manage to make riffs memorable enough to keep me coming back. Sometimes I wish there was vocals in it, but not too often. The production, not overly raw, comfortably lo-fi, and very warm, is spot on. One of the best works I've heard this year.

&amp;nbsp;

[**Vlad Tepes/Belkètre** - ***March to the Black Holocaust*** \(1995\)](https://drakkar-productions-official.bandcamp.com/album/vlad-tepes-belketre-march-to-the-black-holocaust)

The one entry on our wiki's black metal essentials I didn't had covered. Holy shit? I wasn't too keen on Belkètre but the Vlad Tepes tracks are amazing and indeed sound timeless. So many riffs. It's inspired, very well written black metal, with the kind of raw execution that I find fascinating. Highly energetic and truly captivating. Did I mentioned riffs? They don't just stand there being all black/punk, they like to change in surprising ways and in very effective manner — like in the unexpected long-ass epic ""Drink the Poetry of the Celtic Disciple"" and the delicious twist in the end of ""Diabolical Reaps"" (*""goat is the dark warriors!""*). Belkètre is much more chaotic and punishing and fucked up, but it lacks hooks. It might work at another time, when I'm not as absorbed by Tepes. 

&amp;nbsp;

[**Black Cilice** - ***Mysteries*** \(2015\)](https://hiddenmarlyproduction.bandcamp.com/album/mysteries-2)

[\(\(\(wooooOoOoooOOooOOOo\)\)\)\)\)\)\)\)\)\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AkdQqQn3j4)

Every now and then, when sharing impressions about music with my friends we'll run into the ""vocals make or break"" axiom. I love how this album solves it: by substituing words with distant, uncomfortable wailings. Cilice takes to heart the ""vocals are another instrument"" idea, but instead of going the percussive route, it went for a synth/flute path; vocals here are like a pad, or like wind building up and being captured by microphones. I feel like a six year old child staring at nothing, mesmerized by the sound. By far my favorite BC album, *Mysteries* is raw, but not harsh; it approaches noise, but it's embracing rather than pushing. It's also very interesting, both riff and drumming-wise; it isn't lazy and doesn't hide under its layers of fuzz. I like Black Cilice when it shrieks but I like it more when it wails.  (The [latest BC album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_5kdIhx_to) is pretty good too.)

&amp;nbsp;

[**Carved Cross** - ***Carved Cross***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQtnQPrxa0Q)/***Demos/Futile Reflections of a Failed Existence***

I don't know. I just line them up for a 3 hour playlist of faint lo-fi melodies and anguish and let it go. It's like ambient music, and I say this as someone who listens to a lot of ambient. It nests on a section of my brain and irradiates warmth; I don't know how to explain, I just love it. Maybe it evokes the old teen feeling of letting music absorb everything that's wrong with me, with life in general, and make it bearable. It's a refreshing feeling that comes from very claustrophobic music. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Empire of Hate** - ***Carved Cross split/Unsolicited Visitations/Morthond split/Visions of a Better Time***

This is where it all melts down. Empire of Hate has a bit of everything I just talked about, and then it records into an old tape recorder recording another old tape recorder; a bit more and it would be *The Disintegration Loops*. Rich, entrancing music, its vocals are similar to another favorite of mine, Vassafor: processed beyond recognition, creating a layer of unearthly whispered hidden messages. Riffs (and chords) are frequently simplistic while retaining a lot of tension and charisma. While raw, it feels somehow soft, and it sometimes makes me think about a parallel universe where blackgaze isn't a hipster word used by boring bands.

 Hey there and thank you for conducting this transparent Iama-  I read your

 answers as far as where you state that you've career-transitioned into a

 federal agent. Thank you for your service. Additionally, I believe you're

 probably more transparent than most. Also, did you  take the Aleks (sp?) facial

 recognition system designed by Paul Ekman to spot deception? I hear Fed agents

 are some of the best at this skill.  WITH that all aside, lol, I'm just curious

 if you at all believe the music industry to be a form of social engineering?

 When I use logic alone, I come to the conclusion the answer is a resounding

 yes. The creative content of these songs on the radio are clearly lacking, but

 the repetitive nature of their airing is questionable. In conunjunction with

 the idea that any of the messages they convey are delinquent, vapid,

 hedonistic, and catchy--to the point of similarity in sound to child's music.

 Since the audience is directly requesting this music (per your answers), then

 the music is being aired with an intention. Just what that intention is, is

 besides the point, I suppose. I'd more like to know if it seems to you a

 reasonable rationale that this music is served to develop poor quality of ideas

 for people that listen to it.  Thanks and take care

 When I was growing up Alternative used to be Rock-based, like Linkin Park, Sum

 41. I would consider it more like Rock-Punk than pure Rock. Sure there was also

 Limp Bizkit and even Beastie Boys mixed in. Now the pure Alternative genre has

 evolved to be more Folk-like and the Rock variety has taken a backseat to

 emotional country music.   For 1077 The End in Seattle I attribute this turn to

 about the time that they did a user study in Tacoma and asked the people what

 they wanted to hear. We of course said ""more new music"" since we were tired of

 hearing Nirvana and Pearl Jam every 5 songs, as much as we liked those bands.

 The one good thing that came out of this discussion was the ""fewer commercials""

 request. The problem is that ""more new music"" carried with it bands that were

 further away from the pure Alternative genre and ventured more into folk and

 country music.  Can you tell me why we can't find any good Punk-style

 alternative on the radio anymore?

 I worked at a radio station for 4 years as a teen - it was a small station,

 covered only a few neighboring towns. I always remember my first day, thinking

 that it was going to be so awesome making all these radio shows... Only to find

 out most of it is automated and pre-recorded, with like 5% of the content

 actually live. I always wondered if it was the same way at bigger stations (in

 bigger cities).   As for my question: what was your biggest fuck-up on the air?

 If you had one at all, that is. I recall slamming a sports team for a bad play,

 only to realize my mic was still live. :$

 I've had multiple friends in Radio, and I've been lucky enough to go into the

 studio with them and see how it all works.  From what I've seen, very little of

 what you are saying is still accurate now that everything is digital.  Now they

 did work for a small Radio group that actually cared about their listeners, not

 one of the big one (Clear Channel or IHeart) that only cared about pushing

 certain bands.  So maybe that's why it was different. One example: inserting

 songs in the playlist is cake, as long as it comes from the approved list

 (which has tens of thousands of songs).  How do you feel about the digital side

 of things? and the fact that you have to be pretty versed in Computers to do

 anything, but at the same time have way more options in what you can do.

Regardless of what you thought about her past work, her Bangerz-her Dead Petz, it always felt to me like she was moving to something greater. She was ready to push boundaries.

* Maps do not have to accommodate for reloading, nor does it impact your movement.

Reloading even has a purpose to balance some weapons, allowing them to have more ammo and power but preventing that ammo from being used all at once.

Nice to see that in 2017, I am not the only one still possessed, obsessed, and captivated by the boundless musical genius of Robert Pollard. I'm 52 and I still go to his shows, tie a minor one on, push to the front, and worship at Bob's altar. I really do regard him as a latter-day rock Beethoven. His output—uneven as it may be, and prolific to the point of being epic, from the many (awesome) iterations of GBV to solo stuff to Boston Spaceships, Lexo and the Leapers, Lifeguards, Keene Bros., Airport 5, Psycho &amp; the Birds, Circus Devils, The Takeovers... I mean, Holy Shit!—still has high points equal to the best from the ""voices"" that guided him. The Beatles. The Who. The Kinks. All the British Invasion Nuggets stuff, and whatever other greatness he was inhaling back in high school in Dayton Ohio between throwing fastballs and shooting hoop.

No wonder you could come up with 400 winners.

Keep enjoying 'em, over and over again. Robert Pollard is a fountain that never stops giving. I only wish he was lauded and recognized for being an equal to the greats.

Unranked playlists aren't casual unless you a good player. Ranked playlists are more casual for beginners and bad players. I'm sure Bungie realises this so if unranked/ranked playlists ever get added to Destiny I'd expect quests and loot to push most players towards ranked playlists. The unranked playlist would probably be full of regular players looking for relaxed matches against other regulars.

Removing individual scores and making winning less rewarding might be a way of creating a playlist that is actually casual for the majority of the players.

Edit: I've just seen your edit. If you're caring about your score and medals you are **not** playing the game casually. It doesn't matter if you're in a ranked or unranked playlist, if you're looking to improve then you're playing the game competitively and, frankly, you should be playing against opposition of a similar skill level.

Hell, it could be really neat if it went off of its own MMR system and didn't display an SR at all (kind of like quickplay), but while still following the competitive rule set. Ultimately, I really wish I could practice for competitive with groups of players who want to take it seriously so I can work on improving my team play, instead of lone wolfing it to warm up in quickplay alongside a Hanzo, Genji, Sombra, Symmetra, Torbjorn, and, if we're ""lucky"" enough for a healer, a Lucio.

t5_38nn9,,,,False,,,,,,,Nudelete,,,,,,di7pcgh,,,0,,,,nudelete,,,t3_6e53lb,1,,,,,,"&gt;Check out this list and tell me what you think? How many of these do you do? What did I forget to add? 
&gt;
&gt;Here are 33 different things that should be a part of your practice sessions.
&gt;
&gt;[Here is a free PDF tally-sheet / checklist.](https://eatsleepguitar.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/esg-guitar-tally-sheet.pdf) I am going to keep mine in the practice space and tick off the boxes as I remember to do them. This will also help me to remember what I am forgetting to do. Also, I didn’t add “Play with a Metronome” because I believe that should be a part of every exercise.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**Play in the Mirror**
&gt;
&gt;Ever record a video of yourself playing? Its both insanely funny and absolutely horrifying watching yourself unconsciously making weird guitar faces. Like anything else, you can control how you look with a little bit of practice and repetition. Its also quite interesting to watch the reflection of your fingers moving, which doubles as a way to STOP looking down at the fretboard while you play.
&gt;
&gt;So go sit or stand in front of that mirror and desperately try to prevent what can only be described as [“John Mayer face“](http://imgur.com/dtbWtRz). Unless thats your thing of course, it certainly [works for him](https://samltd.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/john-mayer-guitar-face-3.jpg)!
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**Play with the Lightest Touch Possible**
&gt;
&gt;For me, learning this skill was side-effect of playing all the time and my girlfriends getting pissed off because a movie was on or it was late at night. So I started to experiment with how I could make noise while using the lightest possible finger pressure. Kind of like turning down the volume switch.
&gt;
&gt;I did this with both playing lead and playing chords and I eventually started to realize how much unneeded pressure I had been putting my fingers through prior to this learning this new skill. So do your own experiments with finger placement, finger pressure, overall hand pressure, etc…
&gt;
&gt;Bonus: Try to play a note and lift your finger as little as possible from the string after playing it. Just enough that you are not muting it, but close enough where you can hit it again with the smallest possible distance of finger movement.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**Play a Solo but You Can Only Breathe During Silence**
&gt;
&gt;I cannot remember exactly where I heard this game but it is a great way to add some air (get it?) to your playing. But seriously, one of the main differences between a good soloist and a beginner soloist is phrasing. When.we.have.a.conversation.we.don’t.talk.like.this.with.all.the.words.crammed.together.and.never.shutting.up.
&gt;
&gt;But way too often, a person with a guitar will play a continuous stream of notes without pause and without a break, and without a clear consciousness of adding some space and silence to make the licks sound better by contrast.
&gt;
&gt;So try this: play a solo but you can only breathe during dead silence. Bonus points for doing this while a metronome is ticking away!
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**Sing Each Note As You Play It**
&gt;
&gt;This one is pretty self-explanatory. Of course in the beginning you will be playing the note first and then matching your voice to its pitch, but after a little practice you will find yourself hearing the sound of the note before you even play it. With even more practice you will find yourself hearing the interval (the space between the two notes you chose) before you even play it. And that is where you want to be!
&gt;
&gt;This exercise goes hand-in-hand with the next one:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**Play a Melody that you Hummed First**
&gt;
&gt;The end goal of every musician is to shorten the distance between the music that you hear/create in your head and what your body needs to do to make your instrument play it. This exercise is also self-explanatory and like the last one, you will naturally suck at it when you first start. But stick with it!
&gt;
&gt;You don’t have to start by humming that insane solo that you made up while sitting on the toilet seat (but record that humming for later). Start with something simple: two or three notes. Sooner or later, you will be humming into your phone’s recording device and busting out those melodies when you get back to your practice space!
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**Play Only on One String**
&gt;
&gt;This is a great exercise for both skill building and creativity. Amazing creativity is said to come from limitation and what better way to try this than to limit yourself to just one string. You can play a famous melody (Happy Birthday) on one string, try to rearrange parts of a famous solo onto just one string, or just put on a backing track and use that single string to go crazy.
&gt;
&gt;This exercise will help you to better understand intervals and as a bonus, if you can become proficient on a single string then you can pick up any stringed instrument in any tuning and play something. A valuable skill and a great party trick.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**Solo Only in the Open Position**
&gt;
&gt;The open-position of our guitar is something that a lot of people forget about. We tend to stay there when we are beginners and then we become “too cool” for it. But the reality is that all the really good players know how to absolutely utilize-the-shit out of it.
&gt;
&gt;And there is a reason for it. It is probably the most versatile part of your guitar, strictly based on the amount of open string combinations that a good player can intertwine with their fret soloing. This skill also comes in handy when using a capo because all of those cool open string solo combos now have their unique color that you can’t get without a capo.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**Play the Guitar Percussively**
&gt;
&gt;The guitar is an extremely percussive instrument. You can smack different areas of the body like a drum. You can slap the strings with your thumb. You can scrape and rake with your pick. You can flick at the strings with your picking hand in multiple ways. You can use all kinds of different muting techniques to really get a really nice “popping” sound.
&gt;
&gt;Those are just a handful of examples. Think about it like this, can you do anything like that with a piano? Or a saxophone? So utilize everything that makes your instrument unique and you will surely create some really cool music! [Like this dude I used to watch in the NYC subway who strapped a tuna-can lid to his guitar.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQa3EZXmM34)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**Record Yourself**
&gt;
&gt;Every single musician on the planet knows that immediate “what the hell is happening” moment as soon as the recording button lights up. Its a truly amazing phenomenon. No matter how good you think you are, you will be undoubtedly worse as soon as the actual pressure to “get it perfect” starts grinding away at your senses.
&gt;
&gt;Your fingers will be betray you. Your voice will betray you. Your very mind will reel in horror as you start “take 25” of a song that you could play perfectly when not being recorded. But like anything, it does get better. You just need to keep practicing being in that high-pressure recording situation and you get more comfortable with those feelings and pushing through them.
&gt;
&gt;But remember, every person experiences being worse when the pressure gets turned up, even those guitar greats you idolize. The trick is, they are so good that even at their worst, they are still good enough to make it happen. Aim to be that good.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**Play a New Cover Song**
&gt;
&gt;One of the things I have been doing lately is torrenting, I mean, uhhh, legally purchasing compilation albums at the Pirate Bay store. Something like “hits from the 90’s” or “Now Thats What I Call Music!” etc…
&gt;
&gt;Adding these albums to my shuffle playlist has really made me understand that there are 100’s of songs that I LOVE that I have not even covered yet. I am sure you are the same way. I would recommend making a list and anytime you think of one or stumble upon an old favorite on the radio, write it down. Covers are a great way to learn new chords, understand music-theory patterns, and to make friends at social events. You’re my wonderwaaaaaaaallllll!
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**Play Standing Up**
&gt;
&gt;I am a firm believer in playing the guitar as often as possible. So when I am sitting on the couch watching movies with my girlfriend, I also usually have an acoustic in my hand, playing quietly. Sometimes I play laying down in bed. I even once heard that Jimi Hendrix played on the toilet!
&gt;
&gt;But don’t forget that if you want to play stages, you most likely will have to get comfortable playing standing up. This change, at first, will make everything feel different; so it is important to start practicing that way now! Experiment with your guitar strap and try different positions to see what feels most comfortable.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**Play with a Capo**
&gt;
&gt;This was another subject that I used to be really stubborn about. “I don’t need a capo maaaan, my fingers are the capo maaaaan!” But honestly, capos are not just a cheat for lazy guitar players who still believe that barre-chords are impossible.
&gt;
&gt;Capos are a great way to make your guitar sound fresh. Because once you slap that bad-boy onto your fretboard, you have a whole new world at your fingertips. For one, you have an entirely new arrangement of ringing-out open strings that create amazingly fresh chord variants. Sounds that you probably haven’t had a chance to hear or experiment with yet.
&gt;
&gt;Also, if you are a singing guitar player, move that capo around a bit and sing your tunes at different parts of the fretboard. This will open a lot of cool possibilities and room for experimenting.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;**Play a Solo from a Guitar Legend**
&gt;
&gt;I used to think that learning to copy a solo from a guitar legend was a cheap thing to do and would make me sound unoriginal. But just like with the guitar cover tip above, there are so many cool things that can be learned by trying to emulate others.

In the end though; I would rather do VoG, then CE, than do VoG twice. Why? Because of Variety.

I would rather do Sepiks Prime, and that one on the Moon with the Ogre, then Omnigul, then Sunless Cell, then Sunless Cell 4 times in a row. Why? Variety.

The second old content gets gated out, variety immediately disappears, and new content gets stale fast, by nature of doing it over and over and over because it's the only way to progress.

Another thing to keep in mind is though: If people go to ""old"" content because it's more fun, then why shouldn't they? If it's more fun to play, it's more fun to play. Isn't that why we play? That puts the pressure on Bungie to push out content, that's not only more interesting, but more importantly more fun.

But even THEN, if all I do is old stuff, it will get stale, but if all I do is new stuff, it gets stale. It ALL needs to be in the playlists, it ALL needs to be relevant. So that it doesn't get old. Having a pool of 13 strikes to choose from instead of 3 will always be preferable. 

AoT works great, because one week 3 or 4 strikes will be features, then next week a different set of strikes will, then next week a different set. It keeps people in the same matchmaking list, it keeps all content relevant, and it keeps that feeling of variety, we aren't doing the same 3 strikes over and over for a year until the next expansion.

t5_2qhx4,,,,False,,,,,,,Fitness,,,,,,di6t6f3,,,0,,,,Vote_Gravel,,,t3_6e0uhr,5,,,,,,"Congratulations on pushing yourself with this race! I just did my first obstacle course in a couple years this Saturday. It was only 5K, but if you excuse my humble brag I placed surprisingly well. I would say the key to my success was my comfort in running. I didn't walk any part of the course except through some of the water and mud pits, and even then I mostly tried to high-knee run it. (5'3"" 27 F so my height was a disadvantage.) I could use my jogging between obstacles as a cool-down and I didn't need to slow all the way to a walk to catch my breath and pace myself.

So yes, couch-to-10K sounds like an excellent strategy. You could put in other cardio once a week if you're really getting bored of running, but I would practice running and develop that skill specifically. 

You can check out /r/running's FAQs, but here's how I got started into distance running. 

- **Keep shuffling.** You can let your pace slow down so that speed walkers can pass you, but just keep the bouncing movement of jogging going so that you're used to it. Eventually your strides will lengthen so that when you ""slow down"" you're still jogging at a decent speed.

- **Incorporate slight hills.** Whether on a treadmill incline or outdoors, use topographical variation to increase speed. It'll be especially helpful for your race.

- **Listen to music.** You won't be able to do this in the race, but I just need something to drown out the sounds of my heavy breath and my feet hitting pavement. It's also easier to let my mind wander to a dance beat. I like listening to familiar music that I love but I update my playlists so I don't get bored.

- **Change your scenery** if you can. I recognize that this may not be an opportunity for you, but if you have a chance to go trail running on Saturdays or switch from the treadmill to indoor track at your gym, do it. Part of what I like about running is enjoying the view. I've been jogging for recreation for around 12 years now and it took me a solid 9 years before I could stand running on a treadmill. I don't know how anybody has the willpower to *start* running on a treadmill. It's so mind-numbingly tedious.",,,,default,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6e0uhr,,,,,,,,,Figure Skating (Professional),,1496074151.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1496919076.0,,,

&gt; 
&gt;She pointed towards the day’s eleventh intruder, cowering under a fold in the tent’s ceiling. No pity. No mercy. I brought the wrath of God down upon its head. *Splat.*
&gt; 
&gt;“That the last of ‘em?”
&gt; 
&gt;“Yep. That was the last mosquito on the planet, hun. You're welcome.”
&gt; 
&gt;“Well, just in case. Throw up that insect repellant thing outside and let's get some fucking sleep. I'm beat.”
&gt; 
&gt;I unzipped the flap and set up the lamp outside, and turned it on. It glowed a dim yellow, and it pushed back the darkness just enough to illuminate two other would-be invaders that dipped their wings at the light and flew away. I zipped up the tent flap and said, “Reminds me of Passover.”
&gt; 
&gt;“Yeah, except i might actually choose death of the firstborn over this shit.” 
&gt; 
&gt;“Well, we haven't had a kid yet.”
&gt; 
&gt;“Exactly. That means we get off Scott free.”
&gt; 
&gt;“I knew I married you for a reason. Anyway. I'm exhausted.” I kissed her and crawled into the bag. “Tomorrow we hit the cliff.”
&gt; 
&gt;“Tomorrow we hit the cliff.”
&gt; 
&gt;And with that we fell asleep.
&gt; 
&gt;---
&gt; 
&gt;“*Tooodddd.* Wake up, kiddo.”
&gt; 
&gt;“Mmmmmppph.”
&gt; 
&gt;“It's morning. Ready to rock and roll?”
&gt; 
&gt;“Mmmmphhccan we Adult Contemporary instead?”
&gt; 
&gt;“Should've let me know before we left. I would've updated the playlist.”
&gt; 
&gt;“What time is it?”
&gt; 
&gt;“Nine A.M.”
&gt; 
&gt;“We’re late.”
&gt; 
&gt;“We’ve still got the whole day ahead of us. But I do want to get out there by ten.”
&gt; 
&gt;“Yeah.” I waved her off and sat up and rubbed my eyes. “I’d kill for some eggs and bacon right now.”
&gt; 
&gt;“What about a granola bar?”
&gt; 
&gt;“Or a granola bar. Haven’t had my fill of those yet.”
&gt; 
&gt;She tossed me one and ate the other herself, and then we unzipped the tent and stepped outside. Then she stopped. 
&gt; 
&gt;“Whoa.” She leaned over and picked up the repellent lamp and switched it off. “How old did you say this thing was?”
&gt; 
&gt;“Brand new. I got it last week.”
&gt; 
&gt;“Did you get it at a scratch-and-dent auction?” She showed me a large chip along the middle of the glass that *definitely* hadn’t been there before, and which was covered in the unmistakable brown smears of mosquito blood. I took it from her and turned it over in my hands. 
&gt; 
&gt;“The hell? I swear to God it was in perfect condition last night. Maybe it was just dark and I didn’t notice it.”
&gt; 
&gt;“Todd.” I looked up, and then down and around at where she was pointing There were at least a hundred dead mosquitoes lying in the dirt. Maybe several hundred. 
&gt; 
&gt;“Gross. Let’s get a move on before I puke.”
&gt; 
&gt;So I tossed the lamp into the tent, we shouldered up our gear, and then we hit the trail. The dirt path wound up out of the campsite, where a handful of other hikers had set up shop, and then it curled around the crest of a wooded hill and carried on through the forest and up the mountain slope. We spent the walk waving off mosquitoes.
&gt; 
&gt;“You bring any bug spray?” I slapped my neck for the hundredth time and couldn’t help but notice how *painful* the bites of these particular mosquitoes were. “I’m getting eaten alive out here.”
&gt; 
&gt;She sprayed herself down a little and then tossed me the bottle, and I almost showered in it. I’m not sure it did much good, though. The mosquitoes were out in force, and the further up the mountainside we went, the worse it got. 
&gt; 
&gt;“Son of a *bitch.* Little bastards flew down my shirt.” Michelle was slapping at her stomach and waving her tee shirt to force them out from the bottom. I saw one or two fly off. “Is this even worth it?”
&gt; 
&gt;“I think so. Its muggy down here, but it should clear up when we get to the scramble. Mosquitoes probably won’t be swarming anywhere with a good amount of wind.” 
&gt; 
&gt;“I think we’d need a hurricane at this point.” 
&gt; 
&gt;“Right? I feel like that guy from *Gulliver’s Travels,* getting attacked by little people who think he’s a giant. What was his name again?” 
&gt; 
&gt;“Gulliver?”
&gt; 
&gt;“That’s the one. But, hey - look.” She followed my gaze and saw, not a few hundred yards up, the boulders at the top of the mountain. There was even a spot of neon green and one of orange that stood out among the gray - clearly the jackets of other climbers. “Almost there. And there are people up there, too. Can’t be all that bad.” 
&gt; 
&gt;The sight of company and open space afforded us a burst of renewed energy, and we walked briskly up to the treeline and out onto the gravel that marked the beginning of the rock scramble. 
&gt;And that *view* - no longer obstructed by the forest, we could see how the mountain sloped out majestically and poured out into the countryside. From up here we could see roads, too, and rivers, and towns, and patches of wood and farmland, stretching out into a valleyed horizon dotted at the far end with the blue-hazed silhouettes of other mountains and other hills and other places to explore. We stood and took it all in for a while, and for a moment we’d forgotten all about the mosquitoes. But then one darted for my neck - *zzzzzip* - and I slapped at it instinctively and came back to reality. 
&gt; 
&gt;“C’mon, hun. Still too close to the woods.”
&gt; 
&gt;The rock scramble was a welcome break from the monotony of hiking. Each pile of arrow-marked rocks presented an obstacle that it took skillful teamwork to overcome, and by quarter till we’d reached the halfway point from the start of the scramble up to the summit. I couldn’t help but notice, though, that the mosquitoes hadn’t even slightly let up. I used my arms as much to wave them off as I did to climb, and if I got attacked while engaging both hands for balance or support, I’d have to spit at the damn things to ward them off. Michelle was as agitated as I was. 
&gt; 
&gt;“How the hell are they up this far? God *damnit!*” 
&gt; 
&gt;“I don’t know, hun.” I swatted another one on my cheek and winced at the pain. “Starting to piss me off, too.”
&gt; 
&gt;“Maybe its not windy enough?”
&gt; 
&gt;“Maybe. Either that or they aren’t as put off by wind as I thought.”
&gt; 
&gt;“I hope these things aren’t loaded with Malaria.” She said it half-jokingly, but then she paused at her own thought and turned in my direction. “They don’t carry *Malaria,* do they, Todd?”
&gt; 
&gt;“In the States? No. At least - *fuck* - I don’t think so.” I looked down at a freshly smacked mosquito by my boot. It twitched once and then stayed still. Michelle groaned audibly. 
&gt; 
&gt;“Isn’t it really deadly?”
&gt; 
&gt;“Yeah. Partly because its more prevalent in the third world, where they don’t have proper medical infrastructure to deal with it, and all that. But all the same, yeah. You sure as hell don’t want Malaria.”
&gt; 
&gt;“Well you’re the one who’s been here before. Think we should turn back?”
&gt; 
&gt;“No. The path loops around at the summit and its not as heavily wooded on the other side. We’ve got a better chance of avoiding these things if we just keep going.”
&gt; 
&gt;So on and on we went, up and over boulders and getting closer and closer to the peak of the mountain. Mosquitoes harassed our advance the entire way. I tried to be positive for both our sakes, but I had to admit - this wasn’t fun anymore. Not even a little bit. 
&gt; 
&gt;Michelle stopped abruptly about fifteen minutes later. 
&gt; 
&gt;“What’s wrong? You okay?”
&gt; 
&gt;“Those two spots haven’t moved at all since we started up.”
&gt; 
&gt;I looked up. She was right. The green and orange spots had stayed perfectly still for the full hour or so since we’d started the scramble. I got a little chill in spite of the heat. 
&gt; 
&gt;“Maybe they’re taking a nap?”
&gt; 
&gt;“Maybe.” I could tell by the quiver in her voice, though, that she didn’t believe that for a second. Neither did I. Still, though. On we went, climbing and scrambling and doing our best to stay focused. We smacked and swatted away at mosquitoes as needed, but their incessant presence was beginning to do more than annoy me. I was getting worried. 
&gt; 
&gt;*What the hell* are *these things?*
&gt; 
&gt;Not a full second after the thought manifested, we heard a rough commotion a few feet up. We stopped simultaneously, and shot each other a pair of glances, and then we nearly dove out of the way as a man and his daughter came flying down the mountain and nearly bowled us over in the process. 
&gt; 
&gt;“Hey, what the hell-”
&gt; 
&gt;*”Corray!”* The man shouted over his shoulder as he flew on past. “Corray! Corray!” 
&gt; 
&gt;We watched the two of them disappear on the other side of some boulders, and then we looked at each other again. 
&gt; 
&gt;*Corray?*
&gt; 
&gt;“The hell was that all about?” 
&gt; 
&gt;“I don’t know. Let’s just keep moving, okay? I’m getting real sick of this hike.”
&gt; 
&gt;We crested the next few boulders and passed under a stone tunnel, and then we emerged at the bottom of the final rock slab that peaked at the mountaintop. Even from down here we could see the figures of two people - one in a neon green windbreaker and the other in orange - lying on their backs a few hundred yards ahead. We moved forward cautiously. 
&gt; 
&gt;*Please be sleeping. Please be sleeping. Please be sleeping.*
&gt; 
&gt;But they weren’t, of course. The first proof we had that something was wrong was a faint buzzing coming from their direction, and when we inched even closer we discovered the sound was emanating from a swirling cloud of maggots above what were indeed a pair of corpses. I wretched. Michelle screamed and covered her eyes, and then she turned to me, still bent over with my hands on my knees, and said, “Todd, what did that guy say earlier? The one barrelling down the hillside?”
&gt; 
&gt;“I-I don’t know. *’Hooray’* or *’corray’* or someth-”
&gt; 
&gt;“Corray? You mean *‘correr?’*”
&gt; 
&gt;I blinked. Sounded right.
&gt; 
&gt;“Yeah, I think so.”
&gt; 
&gt;“Todd, *’correr’* is Spanish for ‘run.’” 
&gt; 
&gt;Another chill. I stood up and I blinked, and then I took another glance over at the corpses. Then it hit me. *Those aren’t maggots.*
&gt; 
&gt;“Michelle, we have to go. Now.”
&gt; 
&gt;“What?”
&gt; 
&gt;“We have to *go!* Come on!”

Yes, that makes the game more difficult, saying it straight up forces the player to buy SC is bullshit.

Same as they do in Singleplayer

&gt;Pursuing AI in biker business missions are scripted to keep up with the player, no matter how well you drive or how many times they wreck.

Same as they do in Singleplayer, rubberbanding my friend.

&gt;Import/export pick up mission with Securoserv guards spawn up to five helicopters making shooting them down pointless and maximizing the amount of damage they can do to the car.

Again, makes the game more difficult, saying it forces you to buy SC is bullshit.

&gt;If you try and sell a car in an empty public lobby the game sends enemies in Kurumas after you where there would normally be none.

The Kurumas are not armored just FYI. Of course it does, nobody would be playing in public lobbies if in solo you could just relax through the ride and always arrive at 100% condition.

&gt;The very fact that crates, biker businesses, import/export can only be done in public lobbies to begin with, and you can't just push a button to create your own empty lobby, you have to waste five minutes doing the playlist method, assuming the game successfully connects you to a public lobby without kicking you back to single player in the first place, which is by no means guaranteed.

Yes, because again, nobody would be playing in public lobbies otherwise. I also don't know where the fuck are you pulling your 5 minute playlist method from, simple firewall rule (or even just disconnecting your internet for a while) will instantly land you in a solo public lobby. And yes, it is guaranteed.

Your best bet is to try ripping it from youtube (if found there), as youtube sometimes has files AND STREAMS them in m4a (aac) 125kbps and 192kbps, which amount respectively to 192 and 320 kbps mp3 (i think 192 mp3 is good enough for most music, 128 mp3/95kbps m4a is pushing it a bit). But as you know in youtube there may be many users uploading the same thing, so you just have to rip as many of them as you can and check out which has the higher bitrate. 
https://www.winxdvd.com/resource/aac-vs-mp3.htm

m4a as seen on previous link, gives you comparable quality to bigger mp3 files, so m4a will save you much space, but as we know, mp3 is ubiquitous, and m4a not yet. So just check out if your player(s) where you will play your music support m4a (AAC).

I recommend MediaHuman youtube to mp3, it lets you download from youtube, per song or even complete playlists, also from soundcloud, per song, complete artist's channel and even complete likes list from any artist, also from bandcamp per song or complete albums. It also has integration with iTunes, tagger, and allows you to rip original format from youtube (such as m4a) not just mp3 conversions.

These are basically in chronological order, in case you want to listen yourself in the stream. Most Q&amp;A happens near the end, after Roman appears

* They will be doing other Event playlists in the future. Apparently will be some crazy stuff in there, which is why it's unlikely to ever earn any War Assets.

* New patch soon. Will include penalty quit. Some colorblind stuff (though more still being worked).

* Community test server playtesting coming up. They pick a variety of previously-used and new gamers from a variety of communities to participate.

* There's a big tourney coming up, organized by reddit mod vivid-naz. Check the forhonor sub?

* Roman says they're not getting enough Orochi feedback. Ubi may start some threads to solicit feedback. Or go post on Reddit or Ubi forums they say. What buffs? What kinds of moves missing? What is the kit missing?

* They noticed the /r/competitiveforhonor sub post by Alexxswx (spelling?) detailing/proving the reflex guard bug that happens related to dodging. They didn't know about it. They reproduced it internally. They're working on it. They said they like when people help them find bugs.

* They saw the video with the Warlord pushing the guy all the way across the map. It's a bug they will fix ASAP. + more changes are coming to WL (they didn't say if nerf or anything).

* They were already aware of the Raider charging bug where he passes through groups, around people, etc. They said aiming used to be better, now broken, they're working on it.

* Roman says they intended the Shinobi kick to be strong. They're not sure yet if it's too strong. They don't think the community has any majority opinion yet either.

* The bug that shows gear as ""new to you"" (yellow indicator) has been fixed internally, getting rolled out ""soon""

* Some broken Trophies have been fixed internally, getting rolled out ""soon"". Others still being worked on.

* They may add chip damage. It's something they're playing with internally.

* They know multi-centurions can kick-spam in 4v4 and it's bad. They want to solve this. Roman later says it's already fixed that 2 Centurions can't stun-lock juggle someone...there will be a window to escape that.

* No plans for 60fps on console

* They know people want more than 60 inventory slots. It's tough to solve apparently due to memory and other tech issues. Maybe someday.

* Ranking still being worked on/tested internally (no new news, same status as last week).

* Last week Roman talked about data balancing using top 7% of players. They do also use data for the middle of the bell curve, and win/loss looks ok there. They also check that population to see if any moves are over-used. They don't work with the middle-tier data the same was as the top-tier data, and they don't look for the same kinds of information.

t5_2y178,,,,1495736887,,,,,,,WorkOnline,,,,,,di19t3j,,,0,,,,theMediatrix,,,t1_di0m77u,16,,,,,,"You are a good writer! -- Please don't let a random IQ test make you think you aren't. (I'm a journalist, and an editor, so I know what I'm talking about.) IQ tests aren't always accurate, for a variety of reasons.

Also, you are a musician, and understand audio mixing. This is a marketable skill. (I'm also an audio producer, so again, I know what I'm talking about.) 

You actually do have skills, you just don't recognize them or know how to apply them or translate them into services. That takes time for anyone to figure out (it's also why people go to college -- not just to learn but also to discover more about themselves; I understand it isn't an option for you right now, but please keep it in mind for the future).

What can you do right now, in a small town? Here are the steps I would follow if I were in your position:

**1.MINDSET:**
 

Accept that you're going to have to be persuasive in convincing someone to ""give you a chance."" You need to do it by coming across as trustworthy and calm (not desperate or stressed). This takes practice, but give yourself a pep talk each time you're minutes away from speaking with someone. 
During the pep talk, push your nervousness down and out of sight. You don't have to acknowledge it to yourself. Instead, ""act as if"" you are calm and in control. Acting ""as if"" is a great technique for helping yourself not be nervous or desperate. Pretend you are already a success, and practice saying this (to yourself outloud): ""Hi! Great to meet you. I'm friendly, calm and in control."" 

It sounds [really] silly, but your mind will believe you!

**2.PITCH:**
 

Develop a basic ""How Can I Be of Service"" pitch. This is what you will say to people you are going to ask for jobs. Write it out and practice it out loud -- seriously -- even to your friends, if you aren't shy about it. Here's an example: 

""Hi! I'm MonsterFukk! Are you the manager/owner? Thanks for taking a few minutes to let me run this by you. I'm in a bit of an unusual situation -- I'm job hunting, and well, you know what it's like in a small town -- and I thought I'd see if my services might be of use to you. Here are some things I can do: [skills/services related to the business]. Would any of this be helpful? I'd love to be of service and I'll be honest -- I really need a job. if none of this is useful, is there something else you need? I'm happy to [clean, wait tables, wash dishes, etc.]. I'm hardworking and reliable."" {STOP}

There are two important things about a pitch -- the first is to say enough in a simple and straightforward way and the second is to STOP TALKING and WAIT at the end. The second part is the hardest, because you are letting the other person think it through before responding. Resist the urge to jump in and say more. Just wait. If you need to, mentally distract yourself with observations while you wait, like ""his eyes are brown, his hair is brown, his shirt is white"" etc. Then really listen to the response you get and be ready to remain positive.

Also prepare a mini goodbye pitch -- ""Well, thanks again for your time. And please reach out if you think of any way I might be able to help out.""

You'll have to tailor the pitch to the businesses, obviously, but that won't be hard if you learn your basic template inside and out so you can adapt it on the fly as needed. Also, it will give you confidence. :) 

IMPORTANT NOTE: You can take a stupid job for now, like dishwasher or retail clerk, and work on writing and music in your spare time, then transition into more of a career later. The important thing as you said is for you to get some money coming in on the regular.

**3.TARGETS:** 

Make a list of businesses in your town, starting with the one's that seem to be most appealing to you, or that you might have something to offer.

A good way to check out local businesses is to go to the library and look at the yellow pages. I know it seems easier online, but there is a lot of helpful info about businesses in their yellow page ads. You also come across businesses you never knew existed or didn't realize you might be interested in.  

You can then use google to see if you can figure out who is in charge, but you may end up having to walk into a business and ask to see ""a senior manager."" If possible, you'll want to talk to the Owner, or the Senior Manager, because they are the decision makers. 

Mom and Pop (not retail chains) are probably going to be a better type of business in your town, because there is probably competition for any chain retail outlets, like McDonalds. 

**4.RESUMES:**


Prepare a stack of resumes and brief generic cover letter that you can leave at businesses. You are in a small town, so this will have even more power than if you were in a busy town with many people applying for every retail job.

You say you don't have experience, but you can tailor what you know to make it look good. Have a list of skills at the top and then make some of your experiences sound job-like:

SKILLS:

* Excellent Copywriting

* Creative Problem Solving

* Deadline Oriented

* Audio Mixing (Protools, Adobe Audition, Hindenburg)

* Audio Editing

* Customer Service

* Strong Work Ethic

I'm guessing you have other skills that I can't discern from your reddit history, so think about what they are and include them.  

PROFICIENT IN:

* (list all the software you know)

EXPERIENCE AUDIO PRODUCTION:

* Mixed and Edited Four Live Recording Sessions

* Curated, Mixed and Edited Six 50 Minute Playlists

* Composed and Mixed ... etc.

EXPERIENCE WRITING and MARKETING:

* Ongoing Documentation for Building a PC

* Online Gaming Reviews Geared to Experienced Players

* etc etc

Your first resume has to make the most of what you've done, and you can be honest and say you are looking for training opportunities as well.

(Sorry this is getting so long!)

Make a generic cover letter that says something like: 
I'm interested in speaking to someone about opportunities here. I'm very interested in becoming part of your team. If there is a time you'd be open to having me stop by, please don't hesitate to reach out to me at the following number. etc. 
Thanks in advance, etc.

**5.IN PERSON VISITS:**

Go stop in at the businesses you're interested in. Depending on the kind of business, you can ask to talk to the senior manager and then give your pitch or you can ask for a tour of the place and what opportunities are available.

If you come up with a regular service you can offer each one, that's even better:

* Revise the writing on their website

* Write their marketing materials

* Record an audio podcast for them to put on their website

* Jack of all trades

* Organize or track inventory

* Customer Service

* Research

* Errands

**6.BUSINESS IDEAS:**

* Local TV Station or Repeater Station (they need people to push buttons, and your limited audio experience still puts you a tiny bit above a guy off the street)

* Local Cable Access Station (same as above)

* Local NPR Station (same as above)

* Local Playhouse or Theatre (the need people to run sound, hang lights, sweep up, sell snacks, etc)

* Library

* School

* Auto-Shop (web help, marketing, cleaning, errands, podcast)

* Mom-and-Pop Antiques Store (web help, marketing, cleaning, errands, podcast)

* Bed and Breakfast (web help, marketing, cleaning, errands, podcast)

* Small Hotel 

* Game Shop

* Movie Theater

* Personal Assistant (web help, research, errands, writing)

Some jobs, like a movie theater, will require you to fill out a regular application, but the resume and cover letter are still good tools to start with. I hire people all the time, and honestly, I always lean more toward the people who reached out personally above the people who just sent in a regular response to an ad. If someone *asks* to work for me, that is so much more promising than if someone is just filling out applications not caring what they end up with.

Sorry this was so lengthy! I know you are in a tough spot, and this may seem like a lot of work but you could have all this done in a day or two.

If you are really anti doing things in real life, you could post writing and audio services on upwork. I'm guessing you have some gear. The problem with those sites is it takes a while to build a client base, so you need a real life gig to give you time to get those other things going.

If you want further audio advice, feel free to PM me. And maybe someone in my network is in your town (?). 

Good luck!

So many god damned warning signs and all of them were clean as could be. Not one spec of dust. Joseph walked down the hall and stopped at each individual sign to clean each individual letter. This act represented his Wednesday morning. His hands smelled to cheap military grade lemon cleaner and the towel he held was drenched in the waxy substance. The mixture was cheap and efficient in cleaning but left his fingers cold and his hands feeling sticky as it dried. However, he would scrub this hall today just as he had scrubbed this hall for the past twenty-four years. Windows washed using a hazmat suit, floor scrubbed using his trusty mop, ceiling properly examined to make sure no one put their gum on it again and of course as quietly as he could he would clean every letter of every warning sign. 

Twenty-four years up and down the same halls, producing the same trash from the same bins, scrubbing the same toilets, plunging the same ones at that too because of the same suit wearing fat asses not watching their diets and giving the old plumbing a break. Joseph particularly hated the times where the suits invited the rest of the world's suits to see their little zoo. Men and women in executive garb, eating and drinking and fucking and shitting and leaving his facility a giant mess. Joseph was so tired. He finally stopped and looked into the window at the Ancient One. Not particularly interesting, everything slept in here like a baby. Still, a sight to be seen.

""Do not tap."" Joseph said and smiled. He pushed his earbuds into his ears. A guitar played in familiar tune to his playlist for this hall. He knew this song just as he knew every one on the list to help him keep time with what he needed to do before he could return to his own metal walls and playing his PS4 in quiet solitude and loneliness. Coheed and Cambria. Mother Superior. Guitars gave entry to the familiar voice of Claudio. He took his dirty towel and began scrubbing the sign. Words filled his ears from the start of the song that stabbed in a different way then ever before. Lyrics like coward, bite your tongue, and grow up and be a man played. Joseph stopped only a moment and in that moment silence sprung like a snake in the grass sinking teeth into supple flesh. 

""What?"" Joseph whispered. An accident. He must have pulled his earbuds from the audio jack, that's all. However, the earbuds were plugged in securely. His mind or his ears or even the iPod must have betrayed him. Then something else hit Joseph's sense. The smell of wet dank odors and the realization that the hall was dark. He changed the lights himself, he knew every bulb should be fine so why was it dark? It was darker to Joseph than the time they had to move one of the creatures without it stirring. During that time the lights were dim and careful attention to detail was made to move the thing from one prison of metal to another prison of metal. Just a year or maybe a few more and Joseph would retire from this ridiculousness. He would go fishing and try to go on a date and go to a sporting event. Right now, he stood in darkness and silence as if being constricted by something he could not understand.

""Joseph."" 

Joseph's heart went up to his throat and he became stone still.

""Joseph."" It said again. The voice came from within but it was not his own. It was far too dark and deep and with whispers of slithers and the sharpness of blades.

""Why cower to these people?"" It asked. 

""I just clean."" He said to no one and to everything.

""Clean? A slave of mops and a puke bucket?"" Laughter followed this. Terrible and horrid laughter. Joseph pressed his hands to his ears and fell to his knees.

""Are you child?"" The creature somewhere in here asked. Joseph was trained for this, he watched the videos every year. The videos of a woman speaking calmly of work place safety and procedures. The smile of a woman being paid to read off cards without an idea of what laid below the earth.

""What do I do, what do I do?"" Joseph whispered and searched his memory. Memories of him reading a fishing magazine while the woman spoke in the background. Memories of him eating a hamburger and once hitting on the girl who would later to become the head of accounting when he had more hair and less fear. So much less fear then.

""Come on Joe."" He whispered to himself then replayed the words of the tape he was forced to watch as part of his yearly safety training. 

""Okay, first its a girl in a suit. Melony or something. Congratulations on joining the Initiative. Really long contract. Top secret. Weird shit. What do I do?"" Joseph asked himself.

Laughter again. Mocking and terrible laughter of something being entertained by his thoughts. ""Important part. Important part."" Joseph whispered to himself while feeling like the humidity of a swamp was nestling itself around him.

Joseph played the tape in his head as best he could. The woman talking about safety. ""First, just say ""No"" when an Elder God asks for help and walk away. Right? Why did I have to sit here and think of that? Just No. Walk. Away."" Joe's words were becoming difficult to put together and why did he spend so much time sewing together broken thoughts of such an easy concept.

Joseph stood up and said ""No!"" He then began to walk into the darkness of the hall.

""Joseph is this what you want your life to amount to. A pile of shit that you cleaned up time and time again to make people rich while you sit and squandered your life. No lover, no wife, no children and you'll leave here an old man. You've given your life just as so many others have, only you never even got the satisfaction of stepping outside of this metal prison. Or is this about something else? About a responsibility that you wont' accept? Are you punishing yourself? That's it isn't it, Joseph?""

Joseph stopped and the song began to play again. Mother Superior. Haunting guitar and words and song. Joseph had never heard it played like this on his iPod. The slowness was alarming and disarming to him.

""What?"" Joseph cleared his throat. ""What do you want?"" Joseph asked.

""Touch the glass. Free me. Give unto me, join me."" Whispers that suddenly became seductive, powerful and overwhelming to his feeble and tired mind.

""Touch the glass? What do I get?"" Joseph asked.

""Freedom to do whatever you want. You can finally make your place in this world. You will walk with me. Take whatever woman you wish. Leave whatever craters you want. You will never clean anything for anyone ever again."" The words were becoming odd promises that tasted like wine. His mind began to drink furiously of possibility and become drunk in the idea of women at their knees for him. Such power. Such potential. He never had it before.

""What do I do, I just wanted to clean the sign, it wasn't my fault the boy died."" Thoughts and words were now jumbled. He was living it again as he sometimes did. Never admitting his mistake. He was sixteen. He was drinking. Joseph turned the car and there was the boy. Lights dimmed further in the hall and Joseph stood there and was no longer alone. The boy he hit with that car stood behind him. His eyes were eyes of the dead. His skin pale. His gaze was suffocating to Joseph and he knew it was time.

From Joseph's earbuds he heard the lyric ""Victims pay the price eventually, the cost? Let's see its your life."" and Joseph walked forward to the window. 

How odd was it that the warning signs were different but always the same? No human contact with the glass. Observation only. Ancient creatures can pull human energies through glass but can't break it by themselves. What a stupid rule that was. What great deity decided that? Who really cared? 

Joseph was tired and all he wanted to do was go fishing. He pressed his hand to the glass and with madness beginning to sprout as weeds in a garden within his mind Joseph tapped the beat of the drums as the song said ""Your answer is in there, just stare down the barrel. Your sincerest apologies won't write you out of this one"".

Joseph smiled and then Bang. Promises kept.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6d9dta,,,,,,,,,,,1495721508.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1496816623.0,,,

&gt; Born and raised in sunny Los Angeles, Rapper, Songwriter and Producer Tate Tucker was primed for the entertainment industry from a young age. The son of an actor/acting coach, Tucker was exposed to both the glitz and glam of his city as well as its ability to chew up and spit out the dreams of its inhabitants. Committed to escape that cycle, Tucker moved out to Washington, DC in 2010 to expand his horizon and soak up a new culture with new influences. Months later, he had the opportunity of a lifetime to perform in front of Lupe Fiasco and renowned hip-hop scholar Dr. Michael Eric Dyson. Overnight, the video garnered over 150 thousand views on World Star Hip-Hop and from that moment on, he has proceeded to make his mark on the hip-hop community, constantly pushing the once-rigid boundaries of the genre. 

&gt; Since then, Tucker has released a breadth of music in pursuit of his sound--one of which, ""Harlem Shake,"" received over 6 million views on youtube and was even televised on CBS Entertainment Tonight and the song was aired on Paris' Skyrock FM radio station. Currently sitting on over 100 unreleased tracks, Tucker is working tirelessly on an EP with his in house production team that he plans to drop Fall 2015. With over 100 performances under his belt, almost 7 million youtube views and over 10,000 followers on his social media platforms, Tate Tucker is a name to look out for in 2015.

Even though you've started playing a long time ago, you're essentially a brand new player as many things have changed and you haven't played much.  There's an endless things that can be said for general advice, but for now, I'll just link this youtube series here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iko2tqmDpJQ&amp;list=PL9RdXhXESRJzgY_SwHB8T-cZxXljWhQvz 

It's a playlist of a lot of fundamental concepts that gets suggested around here a lot so I'll do my part in doing so too.  I say fundamental, but these concepts can be polished indefinitely and even in diamond will you find less than perfect execution of these concepts.  Nevertheless, you can learn a lot by just watching through even the first few videos.  

And of course, it's always good to die less, but really always actively think about why you are dying. In one game you might just blame it on some fed enemy that there's nothing you could do about, but you might find that it becomes a consistent issue where you don't understand who's fed and who's not leading to you not properly respecting certain things.  This then leads to deaths over and over ahead across games.  It's a pretty bad sign on your profile to see such high death counts even in the games that you win.  

**Specific Advice:**  

I'm a mid-/support- lane main, but since I don't play any of the champions you've listed I'll talk about ADCs instead.

* Tristana - Super safe, a lot of self peel, and definitely a good champion to learn.  An important part of learning any champion is understanding the role of your kit.  Tristana is a monster at taking towers with her E, so that should be what you're mostly doing mid-game.  Farm up early. You'll naturally push, but it's ok, you can just get a few hits on their tower every now and then and jump away when jungle comes to gank you.  And then when you are ready to move on to help your mid-laner, knock that tower down and then go mid to knock that tower down too.  Most Tristana tricks is probably just some animation canceling with her W and other skills, but I wouldn't worry so much about that for now.

* Xayah - Less safe than Tristana, but her R gives her a decent amount of safety.  I use her R defensively ~80% of the time (using it defensively + offensively simultaneously is of course best).  Her basic trading combo in lane is Q + AA (or W + AA + Q) for 3 feathers followed by E for the snare.  I max E Q W, go fervor, and buy BoTRK+Runaans into situational items depending on the game state.  

* Vayne - like someone else said, I wouldn't recommend playing Vayne until you gain a bit more experience.  I suppose if you do well with her, by all means, go for it.  But if you don't understand why she's one of the most difficult champions in the game, I don't think you're quite ready to dedicate a lot of time to her.  Her difficulty doesn't come from her skill kit, but requires immense knowledge about the whole game as general.

* Ashe - Ashe is great because not many ADCs offer an initiation tool.  Most ADCs have to sit back and wait for their team to initiate and start a fight so ADCs lack the tools to be proactive.  Ashe is different. She can press the GO button (R) and make it obvious that you want to start a fight. In almost all levels of play, enemy carries will be exposed to Ashe's global stun at some point, and if you find that moment, you can easily insta-win a fight by wiping out their carry right off the get go.  There aren't too many tips with Ashe apart from learning to fire your arrow.  Try not to aim towards where the enemy champion is, but line it up with a pathway or jungle exit so that it has a higher chance of hitting.  Also, Ashe's Q is an auto attack reset which means you can cancel your AA by AA + Q; just helps output your damage a bit faster.

t5_2ryzy,,,,False,,,,,,,xxfitness,,,,,,di0h8of,,,0,,,,Epoch789,,,t1_di09ke3,3,,,,,,"Warning: I do not follow programs and as such my workouts change day to day. But I will try not to make it too irritating to read. 

Overview: I outsource volume and muscle-buidling to accessories taking a body-part breakdown and then barbell pressing itself for triples or fewer. 

Warm up: the lightest and easiest versions of the accessories or none if I press after I deadlift. 

Actual pressing: I stay above 80%. 

Load up 80% (115). Clean it, press it for a speedy double or triple. 
2 sets of check facebook. Then pendlay row it for 5 reps. Do it again and/or get more plates. 

Load up 89%-90 ish (125 or 130). Clean, pray, press it for a double (yay) or single (whatever). Pendlay row until form breakdown. 1 set of modify soundcloud playlist. Get more plates. 

Load up whatever my second to the last PR was (135). Clean it, pray extra hard, press it for a single (yay) or pass out halfway or at lockout (T-T). Rerack and do a triple as a push press and then actually take a few minutes break. If the single went well I'll do multiple singles at this weight until the amount of effort needed to grind gets ridiculous. Go to accessories. 

If the single didn't go well and I still didn't get it after two tries, load plates to above current PR and push press for doubles and triples. So 145/150/155 (depending on energy to clean). Go to accessories. 

Accessories 

Shoulders: a cybex or plate loaded machine press for heavy sets of 8 (tired day build muscle gently) or 5 (pushing for starting/static strength) reps. Rear delt flyes sets of 6+ reps. 

Triceps: bodyweight dips for greater than 5 reps. Then weighted for 5 reps. Often I leave triceps to the machine and barbell shoulder press when I need to cut volume or if I'm not number chasing. 

Upper back: Pendlay rows, strict with some leeway once I get to weights matching my heavier presses. Sets of 5 or 3. Lat pull down, sitting very upright sets of 6 or 8. 

Rest of the back: chin-ups superset with and following the same scheme as dips. More rows, regular lat pull down and then deadlifts. 

Biceps: I don't chin up enough to cover them and I've had a brush with elbow overuse so hammer curls for sets of 20. 

Bad/Tired/Short-on-time day looks like: 

Start from 80% and grind out singles at the heaviest weight I can do without passing out. Do lat-pull downs and rear delt flyes then leave. 

I hope the write-up helps.

I love racing games. Ever since I was 9 or 10 I was playing the first or second need for speed, also this game called Screamer. Both on pc. Burnout 1 was awesome. All this for context I just LOVE racing games. 

Gta V comes along and there's a little dabble doo of everything. Even decent racing. I'm an easy going guy too. But yesterday i damn near broke my controller.

t5_2vq0w,,,,False,,,,,,,DestinyTheGame,,,,,,di05t2f,,,0,,,,StormbladeX69,,,t1_dhzzxr7,-6,,,,,,"tl;dr Sony will be the reason Scorpio doesn't get 60fps (ok, I can understand 30fps parity there), the 4K Assets available to PC, and Cross Play (Xbox - PlayStation at least). 

Sony will NOT let Scorpio look better than the Pro in D2 even if it is fully capable of Native 4K IMO. That's a bummer. 

I want to know if they're going to make the 4K Assets available to #Scorpio. On one hand I understand capping at 30fps for parity, but at the same time they kind of contradicted themselves with PC. PC will have fps/reso/fov disparity. That's always been the case on PC, but you don't have people screaming for parity. 

I believe that the real reason is the marketing stuff with Sony, and that the weight they throw around there will be what really keeps Scorpio at 30fps (again I understand parity with base Xbox One (S)), but what about 4K Assets. I'd put money down that Scorpio can do 60/4K, but if you cap it at 30fps you DEFINITELY have the horsepower to push Native 4K. Will Sony allow that to happen? Idk. I'm sadly doubtful of getting 4K in D2 on Scorpio because Sony WILL NOT let their marketing baby to look better on Scorpio than it can on the Pro. 

Could I be wrong? Absolutely. In this case I would LOVE to be wrong. 

Where else is Sony screwing the entire community? Cross Play. Again I'd put $ down that it's possible. BUT PS exclusive stuff?! Easy. Have Playlists where certain things/maps can't be used. A DMZ if you will. With PC fps/reso/fov disparity I could understand it only being console-console. I'd accept that. They could have gone with something like Steam, but they firewalled it into Blizzard's system. Ok. Activision hangs on to that, understandable from a business standpoint. 

There's zero reason to disallow Xbox - PlayStation Cross Play. Microsoft already said they're down, but Sony says no. At the very least we should be able to have linked accounts so we could play on any system. Today I'm going to play on Xbox, tomorrow PlayStation, day after maybe PC. How about at least being able to transfer from PlayStation or Xbox to PC without losing your accomplishments such as Rank 6 AoT. PC wasn't available before so it makes sense to have a way to do that. At least a one time snapshot. 

I covered more than just fps, but much of it is linked &amp; deserves to be part of the conversation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6d4vhd,,,,,,,,,,,1495671124.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1496803095.0,,,

What my understanding is, at least the last couple times I have talked with YouTube reps, is that you should keep all your content on one channel. Separate them into playlists designated for what they are ie. Vlogs, Hobbies, etc. 

I have noticed the same issue you are describing, people unsubscribing and or getting upset when I post a personal vlog, etc. different from the content they originally subbed to you for, and it SUCKS..

I don't know what YouTube has planned for future channels. But since every conversation I have had, always ends with ""KEEP IT ON ONE CHANNEL"" I will stick to doing that.

Side note: I have been trying to push them to create notifications for separate playlists on channels for 2 years, it would kinda be brilliant, if you think about it. Subscribe to a channel, choose the type of playlist/s you like from that channel and get notified when that playlist has a new video added. 

So hopefully this gets integrated if more and more people spread it. I think it would help out with this situation in the most efficient way.

And to answer your question, yes creating a separate channel with the same email, should suffice. I have about 5 different channels connected to the same email.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6crhdf,,,,,,,,,,,1495554359.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1496759508.0,,,

t5_2qkog,,,,False,,,,,,,london,,,,,,dhxa1qt,,,0,,,,hatbeard,,,t3_6csum8,7,,,,,,"Today started off perfectly, Ride in was going well. no bag as left laptop at work, nice warm sunshine, barely any traffic, had a couple of summery tunes pop up on my random playlist to bring up my mood. perfect.

then pretty much halfway into my 11 mile journey **pop** *hisssssssss* flat tyre, luckily it happened while rolling to a stop at some traffic lights but still going about 16mph so a bit hairy as I was in the centre of the lane and it was my front tyre.

So I pull out my tools and get cracking on with changing the inner tube, while doing so, a lovely couple in their 40's came up and the wife (translating for her husband from what sounded like spanish to my uncultured ears) asks if I need to borrow her husbands bike tools as he is 'an expert' and they live nearby. I thank them for their generosity but decline as I have everything I need. Was genuinely nice of them and they were the only people to ask if i needed help despite over 200 cyclists having to stop directly beside me at the lights whilst I was fettling (though a group of dickhead roadie cyclists managed to find something amusing about my situation and have a good old laugh, perhaps they weren't used to seeing someone know how to fix their own bike instead of having to pay someone to do it for them).

So tube changed, I set off gingerly down the road for good reason as I make it no more than 800m before **pop** *hisssssss* and I was left with a puncture and no spare inner tubes right outside oval station.

At this point I should have been at my desk showered and ready to work given my early departure but instead I was pushing my bike to camberwell to my friends bike shop hoping they'd have the replacement tyre I needed (they didn't but after some begging let me leave my bike there) I then had to stroll all the way to elephant &amp; castle before finding a boris bike stand along the route I was walking whereupon I was able to ride the final few miles to clerkenwell.

You might think this was where my story ends but no... sat in the very middle of the right turn lane on london wall waiting for the non-stop stream of traffic to open up a gap big enough for me to pull out onto the museum of london roundabout to go right up towards barbican station I had been waiting for no more than 4 seconds after getting to the front of the queue when the taxi behind me decides to overtake me by driving into the hatchings  next to the actual lane and try to pull out across the front of me, I turn and ask him what the fuck he though he was doing as if we'd both try to go at the same time in the next gap he would literally have run me over with the side of his cab. he then starts frothing at the mouth and calling me a fucking idiot. I point out that this entire time there's not been a single gap yet and for a professional driver he doesn't seem to grasp the concept of roundabouts very well. he starts babbling incoherently but I definitely heard the words road tax. a gap appears finally , I pull out and very deliberately hold my line to make sure he doesn't try anything stupid while I'm trying to negotiate the roundabout sp he sits gunning his engine a foot off my back wheel even when I'm 4 feet behind the minicab in front of me as I pull off the roundabout, go past the restricted width roadworks and negotiate the often busy pedestrian crossing, then all the way up to barbican where he and his (empty btw) cab turn towards smithfields market. 

free of his terrorising I continue through the junction and have to come to an immediate full and complete emergency stop on the other side because some old git walks right out into the middle of the road without so much as a glance for oncoming traffic and then calls me a 'fucking cyclist' for my troubles. 

And I still have to get back to camberwell with a new tyre tonight and hope it doesnt blow again on the ride home. 

This day can get right to fuck.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6csum8,,,,,,,,,,,1495532089.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1496753037.0,,,

I remember thinking to myself that night: stop after the third drink. Didn’t happen. I stumbled around Chestnut Street for a while, humming a personally curated playlist of utter nonsense, until I wound up in front of the bakery. 

I thought I was hallucinating when the glass first sprang to life, transforming into a vibrant touchscreen. It’s usually not a good idea to leave me in charge of anything, drunk or not. But *man*, it all looked so tempting.

I waved my hands all over the window, watching the text float around. Individual statistics, weather conditions, power-ups…everything under the sun. 

I don’t remember what combination of menu options I threw together the first time around, but I do know it started snowing in the middle of July.

Thankfully, not too many people were wandering around at 3 AM. A cop came by briefly, brushing snow off his hat but looking otherwise unperturbed. I drunkenly swiped the screen again and the spontaneous blizzard came to an end.

I also recall finding a menu with a search option. “Enter first and last name,” it said. I typed in the name of my ex, Sandy Richards, and changed her “Happiness” level from 60 to 20. Then I felt guilty, changed it back, and made her boyfriend’s dog into a spider. I’m not that spiteful, really. But after four G&amp;Ts, some shit gets stirred up.

I found my page a few minutes later. There was a menu for items, so naturally I gave myself a battle axe. In retrospect, I wish I conjured up a few thousand bucks, but the battle axe looks nice above the fireplace. There was a page to change around my looks, like The Sims or something, but the “alternate modes” menu looked more interesting.

I pressed the center button, labeled “Puzzle Mode.” The buildings around me transformed into Tetris blocks, flew hundreds of feet into the air, and started to fall from the sky. I was close to finishing a line when I realized I didn’t want the buildings to evaporate into nothingness, so I flicked it off. The buildings returned to their original position, but shortly afterwards, an old woman pushed her head out of a third-story apartment.

""Hey! What the hell are you doing down there? I’m trying to sleep and it feels like an earthquake hit.”

I gave a dopey, intoxicated grin. “I’m juss playin’ the video game!”

""Are you on drugs?”

""Nahhh.”

""I’m calling the police!”

I fumbled around and tried to close the debug screen, but kept hitting buttons by accident with my gangly elbows. A Ferrari materialized out of an alley, battle axes rained from the sky, and Sandy’s boyfriend’s dog shape-shifted into an unrecognizable mishmash of animals.

Finally, I reached a menu that asked me to make a password. I panicked and punched in a few random numbers, then tried to log back in. After three failed attempts, it told me I was locked out for 24 hours.

I went back at 4 AM on the dot the next night, but couldn’t remember the darn code or what I did to activate the debug menu.

So if you see a guy doing cartwheels on Chestnut Street in the wee hours of the morning, I’m not drunk. Probably.

t5_2s8ss,,,,False,,,,,,,Ayahuasca,,,,,,dhw7v17,,,0,,,,Fruehling2,,,t3_6ay2p2,1,,,,,,"Ok everyone.  I have a major update on this.  I believe this is related and significant to the above trumpet communication.  

Information that seems to be relevant:

- I have had psychedelics in the past, but never Aya.  And I didn't really want to, or expect to be taking it.
- My wife took Aya two times.  The first time was about a month before, and one thing that kept being really enjoyable for her was to organize a set of pink cards, and even some higher spirit there was just doing that too, rather than anything important.  The last one was when i heard the above trumpet which was suggested to be a communication from a spirit to me while I was completely sober, but my nearby wife was at the peak of her ceremony. It was partly because of this trumpet that I decided to try Aya.
- The Aya my wife used on this 2nd ceremony (and mine) was bought By Someone I Don't Know online.
- I take a scientific approach to most things in my life, and I can entertain the concepts of a spiritual world, etc, but never really ascribed myself to it.  But I have always been interested in parapsychology.
- I found an Icaros playlist somewhat randomly on Youtube.  I think the most important track in there was this:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av2bPolPpkA
- Just a little over 2 years ago I had a very strong addiction to an Opiate.  When I went to get off it, there was no rehab available.  So basically I went through full-on physical and mental withdrawals.  For those of you who don't know what that is like, it's not really possible to describe.  It last about a week.  There is no relief from it the whole time.  Not through sleep, or food or anything.  Sometimes a hot bath with salt slightly lessens it, but mostly only time.  It is a literal physical and mental hell and anguish.  My wife basically visited hell in her ceremonies and the way she described it was similar, just much shorter.  The suffering was more than I ever thought was possible even through torture.  However, after going through it and being clean, I felt kind of reborn.  Healed maybe.  Like I had to be torn apart to be whole again.  This piece from 2 years ago, I think was critical to what happened on my ceremony.
- I wasn't sure I was going to do it even the day of, and I was very nervous.  For 5 days though I did follow the food rules with no fermented type stuff.  The day before, I only ate one thing.  It was a giant smoothy of spinach, carrots, kiwis, ice, and water.  But even before I had that, my stomach seemed to be purging out the back side.  It was more purgey than i had ever experienced and by the morning of, I felt completely clean and empty in my bowels. 
- My wife prepared the drink for me and smoked the room and I had a small houseplant in my room.  I was alone there with the Icaros playing from a small bluetooth speaker.

***drinking at about 9am***
- I drank the same brew my wife drank, but 10% less because she said it was way too intense for her and that she was sure it was too much.
- I comfortably was sat up in the bed and didn't feel the need to move much.
- I did not throw up at all and didn't need to use the bathroom either.
- I saw some web like lines and colors, but mostly nothing special going on but the music was enjoyable.
- After about 2 hours my wife came in and checked on me.  I was still in the same position and I told her the above.  She for some reason was positive that I needed to drink more at this point.
- She prepared another tea with 50% of the full dose she had previously.  So all together that is about 140% of what we were told is a normal dose of a ""very strong batch"".

***drinking about 1115-1130am***
- Started the Icaros playlist over again back to the above track.
- Still sitting up the in same approx position
- Within a small period of time, it happened.  Here I will try to describe, but I don't think it will do justice, likely won't be believed, and honestly feels very unfair to have happened to me.

*******Attempted description********
Instantly, I shot to the end.  Demon level, heaven level, any entity representation level was irrelevant and not of consequence.  Like a byproduct, and I literally bypassed all that through to the end.  I wasn't ""there"" or ""somewhere"" or whatever.  It was like not even thought.  At the end I understood immediately the answer to everything.  It wasn't given or revealed by something.  This was past any ""somethings"".  The answer is obvious and not super enlightening or maybe even helpful.  It just is.  Maybe you all have already found it and I saw nothing special, but it felt different and I never read about any experience like this.  The Icaros was very important during this time.  Oh, also there was no time at all.  Where I was I experienced where time didn't exist.

So the answer or meaning of life that was revealed is just to simply make order.  Every single action anyone or anything does is to make order.  As your immune system finds a virus, analyzes it and wears it down to bring things in your body back into order.  That's why you clean your house, or why the moon protects us from large objects hitting Earth.  The reward mechanism to make us do that is the feeling of pleasure or contentedness that one feels upon completing or even doing an order making task.  It's the primary instinct that all other instincts are there to support.  Over time we as humans are better and better at making order.  Our spread across the globe and later space is to make order.  

So there was ""whatever"" (call it reality, maybe).  Then some disturbance happened.  Like if there was a slow moving, perfectly calm river.  Then you went to the edge and just maybe dropped a rock in.  That rock would just create a few ripples maybe.  But it could also make a small current, which moved some mud or sand, which pushed some fish eggs, which caused a predator to notice this area, which brought more predators, you see where i'm going with this.  So this original disturbance to reality caused everything.  Caused us, heaven, hell, demons, spirits, the universe, everything.  All that we are doing now is trying to work on our little space to bring order, because the end goal is just to get back to that constant state.  That's it.  Very mundane and a little sad maybe.  

Once I knew this, I went through every scenario I could think of to try to disprove this while I was there.  I really couldn't.  One other thing was also about scientists for example, trying to understand physics is because they are trying to understand the source code.  The rules of existence.  With that information, it we will understand this kind of disturbance and be able to solve it much easier.  The same way that if you get the same flu twice you can easily get rid of it if it didn't mutate first.

At some point I opened my eyes to look at my arms in my lap.  They were not mine, like I didn't own them, and didn't feel anything from them.  They were smaller, like I was slightly above.  I did see some kind of weird rats or insects running along my door, but I didn't care about that and just calmly closed my eyes.  I saw the patterns of reality when I covered my eyes darkly, but also didn't care as it was irrelevant to what I was doing there.  So I just went back to what I was doing.  

***4 hours later***
My wife came in to check on me.  I hadn't moved an inch.  I felt the most inner peace I could imagine.  Like a buddah or jesus or something.  I really hesitate to use this word, but I feel like I achieved enlightenment, whatever that means.  I was having a hard time to communicate any of this to her, but we went outside to sit in the garden.  I now have full control of anything inside me.  When I get a headache, I just remove it.  Hungry, thirsty, tired, hot, cold, anything at all.  I can instantly remove anything.  I am completely calm even in an argument.  Everything has a bright side.  I see evidence of the answer in most things people talk or complain about to me.  

That's all that seems relevant now.  I'm sorry about this.  I honestly feel like I cheated.  Like it shouldn't be this easy to get this.  I don't feel like I achieved enlightenment, I kind of feel like I stole it, or I found it laying on the ground on my way to 7-11 to buy some pop.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6ay2p2,,,,,,,,,,,1495475336.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1496734678.0,,,

It all started when a friend linked me to [a ten hour loop of HOME's ""Resonance,""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMfGdzhOEX0) a Vaporwave track that's really relaxing and mellow. It's fine, I guess, but watching that brought up [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyfL9LC1DC4) in my recommended videos. It sunk its hooks into me immediately. It was darker and heavier, with a much faster tempo that I liked a lot more. I linked that one back to my friend, and he identified it as Synthwave, which prompted me to start looking up synthwave artists in general. A few weeks later I've bought eight different albums from various artists and shunted all my favorite ones onto the playlist I listen to when I'm doing my daily exercise. It's cheesy as fuck but I don't care. I fucking love it.

- [Calling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0569Wt-cZ0) from **The World Ends With You**. First got into my head when I was looking for awesome DS games to play, and decided to watch a Let's Play of the game online to see what the hype was about. The first time I heard this song in a video, I looped that part of the video several times over, before calling up my local game shop to see if I could find a copy and hurrying over there. This was the first and only time a *single piece of music* has made me purchase a game. I still dream and hope for a suitable sequel/successor to the game, which seems like it will never happen.

- [Speaking with the Stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jmYkMd3ztE) from Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean. Shamefully, this is a game I haven't played through to completion, and this song seems to be one of the last ones you hear, so I've never heard this song in-game. However, the mournful melody just catches my heart somehow, and has been stuck in my head (and my music library) for a while now.

- [Atempause](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AOVsSksNmI&amp;index=28&amp;list=PLB1A736FC282F9FA4) from **The Binding of Isaac soundtrack** (note that this doesn't appear to play in-game anywhere). This mix on a song from the game was part of the OST, and somehow manages to match the mystery and growing desolation you might expect to experience, being stranded in a curious and solitary basement before finding monsters everywhere. If you're in a more partying mood, the song before it on the playlist, *The Clubbing of Isaac*, might be more up your alley. It's a medley of melodies from the game turned into a fast-paced EDM song, and it's also pretty good.

- [Everdawn Basin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbvJ6cdKn38) from **Dust: An Elysian Tale**. A fast-paced song, fitting for an end-game rush to the final boss, where you use all your Metroidvania-esque powers to take down the enemies you come across. Very triumphant and empowering, it was part of my workout playlist for a long while. The ending power chords, particularly, just make you want to push to the beat and 'let it out'.

- Most of the songs from **Super Mario 64**. If I had to pick just one though, the [Dire Dire Docks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTl0ky4DcHA) theme is just perfect for water worlds and anywhere you want calm solitude.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6ck5gy,,,,,,,,,,,1495424708.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1496721330.0,,,

t5_2qixk,,,,False,,,,,,,halo,,,,,,dhuq86q,,,0,,,,Vegeto30294,,,t1_dhuj7yk,3,,,,,,"Warzone maps are huge because Sprint as a mechanic exists, not the other way around. If you're worried about not moving fast enough, increasing the Base Movement Speed by 20% gives you very similar results to Sprinting, except you're always doing it now and can shoot while doing so.

&gt; Because nothing that 343 makes will feel like Halo 1, 2 or 3 ever did without 100% replicating the gameplay itself which not every current or old Halo player enjoyed.

No one is asking for exactly the same gameplay as Halo CE-3. If we were, then we'd just push harder for Anniversary versions like H3. I'm sure people would have _loved_ to play MCC if it actually worked at launch and isn't a trainwreck of their original selves. Maybe it would have been more successful than Halo 5, maybe not. We don't know and probably won't because history is already set.

People are asking to take the gameplay from Halo CE-3, and _expand on it._ Not go in an entirely different direction (Halo: Reach) and then double down on it (Halo 4) and then adamantly look for reasons to justify some mechanics (Halo 5).

&gt; To go back from where Halo 5 is at now to something like Halo 3 or Halo 2 would be such a jarring change, the population would dwindle even more. 

The same way we went from Halo 3 to Halo Reach? You're basically saying _""Halo already changed, lets just keep going forward and see what happens instead of going back to before it changed in the first place.""_

&gt; Don't think that by reinventing the wheel from 10 years ago everyone will think the wheel is now the best invention ever... again.

I'm not asking to reinvent the wheel. I'm asking to take the wheel that works and turn it into a car. Not take the wheel and then go horseback riding anyway.

&gt; Just because Halo 5 reversed a few things and honed many others that were brought in with Halo 4 doesn't mean it went backwards, it went forwards via a finer route if anything. Mechanics didn't take a hit when compared to Halo 4, they got better and more refined.

We went through a Proving Grounds playlist and changed the radar's size and function in order to accomidate for Sprint. We added Spartan Charge to the mix in order to prevent the double melee problem that Sprint includes. Maps are bigger and Spartans are slower and less mobile than in previous games. Precision weapons have way higher accuracy and range, explosives have a much higher blast radius because they're meant to hit sprinting targets.

They're all just more and more bandages to make Sprint more balanced when it didn't belong in the game to begin with. By design, you're trading the ability to move the best over your ability to shoot, when before we've had them simultaneously.

&gt; If anything else, see if 343 will make permanent playlists right from launch of the next game that cater directly to the separate styles of gameplay that Halo fans prefer. But I can tell you now, they won't. Because it will create a divide among the playerbase that will never be repaired

And that is _exactly_ the reason that the ""anti-Sprint"" people have such beef with 343i (and Bungie to an extent) in the first place. Legitimate players aren't being listened to, and their requests are being drowned out by the new players who now outnumber them because most of the old players already left from not being listened to. Now we're just expected for 343i to take pity and toss us a playlist to quiet us down (which still won't work because again, the maps and sandbox cannot be designed for two very different playstyles).

Hell, 343i kept pushing Breakout until pro players started coming out and saying that they never asked for this, and we're only _just now_ getting weapon changes that aren't heavily focused on auto weapons in HCS.

What if 343i created a game that was centered around ""classic"" gameplay, but threw the newer players a playlist or two that has Sprint? People would start complaining because suddenly they aren't the focus anymore.",,,,HaloTMCC,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6ce4dh,,,,,,,,,"I wort, therefore I wort wort",,1495388633.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1496708878.0,,,

I was fortunate enough to see numerous DJs in their ""working environment and even though there are some that stand out in a positive way I'd say 99% just start their playlist. For extra credit some add optional filters or some cosmetically Ableton touches, but I rarely see some really interesting stuff happening there (at least live). Henry Rollins goes so far and calls them record player players. 😉

Edit: I also read a lot about ""live mixing"" as if it was an art form. DJs pick tracks that fit the mood, match the bpm (mostly automatically in their hard or software, (incredible rarely) pitch it to match the key and push the fader over. TBH that hardly qualifies as more than pushing a button.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6ca2a9,,,,,,,,,,,1495314170.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1496689694.0,,,
t5_2sokd,,,,1495390108,,,,,,,explainlikeimfive,,,,,,dhtby8s,,,0,,,,always-autumn,,,t3_6ca2a9,396,,,,,,"The vast majority of EDM DJ's use the Pioneer CDJs and mixer that are at the venue – they are essentially digital turntables.

Before a gig, a DJ uses Pioneer's Rekordbox software to analyze all their tracks to get the tempo, key, and cue points they may have set, and then they typically export their set (playlist) onto a USB flash drive. When it's time for the show, they plug the USB into the CDJ/mixer setup, and then they can instantly access all of their music; the equipment allows them to do things like change tempo, sync tracks, apply turntables FX (vinyl stops, etc.), mixer FX (delays, reverbs, etc.), and even beat juggle and scratch if they want to/can.

The advantage of this system is that you: don't need to bring your expensive computer into the booth where it's liable to get stomped on, have drinks spilled on it, or even stolen; there is very little chance of having a software issue – e.g. the computer operating system crashing; if you lose the USB, you can just create a new one; you can store an absurd amount of music – more than any vinyl-vased DJ ever could – on a single USB; and, lastly, when you don't have a computer screen in your face, you can connect with the audience a lot more easily – nothing is less appealing to a crowd than seeing someone up on stage with that glaring white light splashed across their face while they scroll through songs or their email or Twitter feed (yes, this happens 🙄).

I have met DJs, famous and not famous, who use Ableton to DJ, or just push play; if that's how they want to do things, well, no one is going to stop them, but I, personally, love mixing tracks live without a pre-arranged set. It is just like playing an instrument, and it allows for all sorts of awesome, happy accidents to occur; also, if the crowd isn't feeling a track, it gives you the flexibility to mix out quickly and switch up the vibe. Lastly, it's just more fun; mixing live is challenging, and I would be bored to tears if I were just standing up there while the music played.

I hope that helps! I started on piano when I was 4, and I dropped out of med school to pursue music. I have been Producing/DJing since 2012, and I have played at EDC Las Vegas, Life in Color, Beyond Wonderland, Trapfest, Freaknight, What the Festival?!, Foam Wonderland, and I have been direct support for people like Datsik, Flux Pavilion, Dillon Francis, Antiserum &amp; Mayhem, Blasterjaxx, Herobust, Wuki, Loudpvck, Gladiator, Riff Raff, Lil Debbie, Brillz, Milo &amp; Otis, TJR, 12th Planet, and a bunch of other folks.

I'm happy to answer any other questions regarding behind-the-scenes DJ/Producer stuff; I've seen so much bullshit backstage and at after parties, and it's really obvious who makes their own music and who doesn't, and who knows how to DJ and who doesn't.

The best DJ I have ever seen, still, to this day, is DJ Craze. He is unreal, and I am thankful I got to peek over his shoulder at a sold out show. Mind = blown.",,,,,,,,,,,,,False,,True,t3_6ca2a9,,,,,,,,,,,1495298959.0,,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,1496684695.0,,,

You need to push your brand.
PEBBs.  Or PEBB.  That's something people remember.
Base an intro around it, and everything. That's an easy thing to remember!  
Keep repeating it in a channel trailer. 
Perfectly Executed Boss Battles is a Perfectly Executed Video Acronym, run with it!
Which leads me to point 2:  Market yourself(still not the mind-blowing bit)
This is gold, people will love it... but only if they know about it.  Make all channel, playlist, and thumbnail descriptions as long as you can stand, make sure thumbnails make it clear which game is being referenced.  They are professional looking, but I can't tell by looking at them which game they refer to.  A person should see, in the thumbnail, before they read anything, that this thumbnail involves  &lt;game&gt; &lt;boss&gt; &lt;defeated&gt; and your channel brand as well.  PEBB, right?
Now to blow your mind(part 1):  post-commentary!
After recording, explain EVERYTHING about the battle.  Every detail, the things you do, the things you could do, the things you didn't do, why you did what you did. 
Even pause the battle if you have to to add all the insight you can possibly think of. 
If you do a 10 minute video describing a 1 minute boss fight by showing possible mistakes and everything, then more power to you!
So you take this post-commentary, along with your professional channel appearance and excessive descriptions, and the final pillar: current games!
Okay, I know this isn't really cheap.  But it doesn't even have to be that current.  At or less than 5 years old should cut it.  
If you explain boss battles, in detail, for defeating bosses, on the hardest difficulty, in games that people are still playing, or are re-playing HD remasters of?!
Look at Resident Evil 4, 5, 6(maybe), and 7... 
I dare you, no sir, I CHALLENGE YOU.  I'm throwing down the gauntlet. 
Do Resident Evil up with boss battles like this, the hardest difficulty level, for each Resident Evil game from 4-7... with the post-commentary.  Battles won perfectly without taking a hit?  And how you did it?  Put them on the game subreddits, facebook...  This is a really unique and legitimate product people WILL really WANT to see and HEAR your descriptions of.  
I mean like, DKC returns?  I remember playing that thing, it's really hard!  I never got past the first boss. Oh, and notice I haven't mentioned a certain game series that's completely based on being extremely difficult and having extremely difficult boss battles... rhymes with... Stark Tolls.  Don't do this game.  Why?
Because that's the one game that people have done this sort of thing to death with.
Of course there will be a bunch of youtubers running to do perfect boss runs of it!  You'd be an also-ran in that situation.
But so many other very hard games... on the hardest difficulty level?  Those are games where you could REALLY corner a market with some good post commentary.
You have the skill, just grab some newer games and GO FOR IT!
Oh and someday I'll be right there to ask you for money :D

For starters, you need to keep making videos. You won't get views on your old videos until your new videos are pulling in about 5000 views. While your new videos are pulling about 20 views, your old videos will passively bring in about 1-2, usually 0.

This is normal! You're doing good!

So let's talk about what you need to fix.

Make some playlists please so your channel's home page isn't just 1 line of uploads from random games. Sort it into games.

Make thumbnails with some words on them so I can get a more eye-catching idea of what game you're playing, and what the video is focusing on.

Your header image doesn't fit on the screen, it's being cut off at the top. Just looks a bit messy. (I'm using the New youtube layout, not sure how it looks on the old one sorry).

Look, that's about it. Just need a bit of a cleanup, and some drive! Push push push! Scream about how awesome your videos are! They're actually good! Tell everyone, don't stop creating and don't stop sharing! People will follow you.

I'm gonna go ahead and subscribe (Feel free to subscribe back, lol) and follow along with how you go. Keep it up!

The wardrobe itself was hidden away inside the actual wall, extending out only when someone touched the small sensor.
&gt;Jasmines own wardrobe had only the one ‘wetsuit’ (*NOT unitard...*) to choose from, she was a little excited to see if Xant had any other clothes.
&gt;
&gt;She was sorely disappointed.
&gt;
&gt;Nine identical jackets and nine identical wetsuits, all the same colour and size.
&gt;
&gt;“Don’t know what I was expecting.” She shrugged, grabbing a jacket and closing the rack.
&gt;
&gt;She spread the jacket out over the rug, it wasn’t a light cotton but a sort of thin vinyl, perfect for stains and spills she expected. With just a few trips she arranged the food bowls around the cushion on her makeshift picnic blanket and gave Sieglinde her own arrangement on the other side.
&gt;
&gt;“Bon-appetit!” Jasmine toasted with her Min-mojito, before it dawned on her, she did know a little German! 
&gt;
&gt;“Prost!!” She smiled, and to her delight, Sigi’s face lit up and the dog gave a short, sharp bark. Jasmine thrust the drink into the air and proclaimed again, 
&gt;
&gt;“Prost Prost Prost!”
&gt;
&gt;“Bark bark bark!”
&gt;
&gt;“Prost!”
&gt;
&gt;“Bark!”
&gt;
&gt;“Prost Prost prost? Prost!” Jasmine mimicked a sentence, but Sigi just stared back happily. 
&gt;
&gt;“Heh, I was pushing my luck anyway.” Jasmine brought the drink up to her lips but stopped. 
&gt;
&gt;“Becks?” She smirked.
&gt;
&gt;The dog gave a low, but not threatening growl.
&gt;
&gt;“Heineken?”
&gt;
&gt;The same noise. Jasmine smirked.
&gt;
&gt;“Weihenstephan?” Sigi returned with a happy bark. Jasmine chuckled. 
&gt;
&gt;“Remind me to buy Oskar a beer when we meet, I’ll have to pay him back for the excellent company you’ve provided.” She finally took a sip of her drink and pushed Sigi’s bowls in front of her. The dog began to eat and Jasmine followed suit, picking up her utensil tongs and shovelling the unique tastes into her mouth. 
&gt;Eating alien tapas on a medical jacket blanket with a german dog for company under imaginary rain. (*There’s probably a Monty Python sketch in there somewhere...*) She mused chewing her Titkian, she gave a glance over to Xant and swallowed.
&gt;He was still sleeping, even after all the noise.
&gt;She put down the empty bowl and stood up.
&gt;
&gt;“Excuse me Sigi, I’ll be right back.” Jasmine walked over to Xants desk. He lay there still, completely unaware of the Alien picnic happening in his office and the commotion surrounding it. The black dataslate dim, still streaming the rain possibly on a continuous loop. 
&gt;
&gt;Alien script flashed across the screen, symbols of triangles and squares. The text wouldn’t have been indecipherable, but Jasmine had no context or key to go off… She slid the dataslate toward her.
&gt;
&gt;“Umm, recording off?” She tried.
&gt;
&gt;Much to her surprise, the device listened. 
&gt;
&gt;“Uhh, show available recordings.”
&gt;
&gt;The list compiled, she counted 6 ‘experiences’ on the playlist. If a normal dataslate could hold a couple of thousand images, then the information needed to hold a ‘sensation recording’ must have been huge… She wandered back to her half eaten picnic and sat down, curiously looking over the Dataslate. Every device she had been privy to, had one function only. Play and record sound, play and record sensation, draw images. Granted, this was probably more restrictions placed on her than the machines, but it was so odd that Xant would have so many dataslates, when one of her own tablets from earth could do all that and more. Well, not the sensation part… 
&gt;
&gt;(*Your brain processes an impossible amount of information Jasmine.*) Xant’s voice echoed in her memories. She frowned, something wasn’t right. Of course the human brain was the greatest processor on her world, but, surely the GC space would have greater computers? Interplanetary civilisations would need to have enormous processing servers, to coordinate shipping lanes, warp gates or whatever it was they had out there. Possibly petabytes of data, but she hadn’t seen a single server or large storage unit since she’d gotten here, was it in a different room or was everything isolated into single dataslates? Did they have a cloud server? Was that what it was like here too?
&gt;
&gt;She looked down at the playlist again. Even if the Datapacket was huge, 6 seemed, small? Nerves worked on electronic signals, she was pretty sure, this dataslate could send those signals straight to her nervous system-
&gt;
&gt;Jasmine was suddenly very uncomfortable.
&gt;
&gt;Her original trail of thought derailed.
&gt;With this tech, you could make anyone feel whatever you wanted, it was simply a matter of finding or recording the right signals, pleasure, pain... 
&gt;
&gt;Was this what her emotions did to the others?
&gt;Were they feeling the impact of her emotions the same way she was feeling the rain through the recording? The heat of her anger? The beating of her heart in panic? The nauseum of her anxiety?
&gt;
&gt;“Oh Xant,” She whispered, “I’m so sorry…” 
&gt;
&gt;She rested the Dataslate in her lap as she came to terms with the realisation.
&gt;She would probably never be able to completely control her ‘emotional frequencies’. Even if she could master the art of keeping a straight face or grace under pressure, she’d never be able to stop her heart from rapidly beating in panic, or the sick, tightening knots she felt in her stomach when faced with an alien concept.
&gt;
&gt;She wouldn’t have wished that on anyone. 
&gt;
&gt;No wonder the rest of the staff freaked out when she took Sieglinde from their custody. They must have all nearly had heart attacks like she did when she saw Sigi in danger. She was like a deaf person at a concert, not understanding why everyone around her was dancing. 
&gt;
&gt;And now that Jasmine did she felt another rock fall in her stomach. She looked at Xant with a new appreciation, he had been there, doing his best to calm her, and everyone else around him even while putting himself at risk. 
&gt;It must have been exhausting dealing with such an overly emotional human like her. A small smirk pulled the corner of her lips, it was exhausting dealing with an emotional human without having to feel the psychic impact. 
&gt;
&gt;“I’m such a pain in the ass.” She chuckled sadly to herself.
&gt;
&gt;“*Dr Uru’Nav Xant, Living quarters*”
&gt;The door slid open and Rynard poked his head through. His eyes focusing squarely on her.
&gt;
&gt;“Jasi? ” His low voice rumbled, “You alright?”
&gt;
&gt;“Oh! Uhh, yeah, I’m okay” She replied, quietly “Just, a little emotional is all, but I’m better now.” 
&gt;Rynard nodded and stepped into the room, a small black box in his hand.
&gt;
&gt;“And the doctor?” He asked, taking a few steps before looming over Xant.
&gt;
&gt;“He’s been out for quite a while.” Jasmine answered,  getting up from her seat on the floor. “I don’t know if that’s normal or…” Guilt invaded her chest again, and Rynard glanced over.
&gt;
&gt;He could feel her. 
&gt;
&gt;Her eyes widened but she took a moment, a deep breath to clear her thoughts and calm her mind.
&gt;She needed to stay calm.
&gt;
&gt;Rynard put down the box on the end of the desk and prodded Xant with a finger. The doctor didn’t move. The security captain then noticed the canister and medipen on the desk. He picked it up to inspect the contents.
&gt;
&gt;Empty.
&gt;
&gt;He opened the drawer, finding another empty vial. 
&gt;
&gt;“How much had he taken? Did you see?” He asked the human.
&gt;
&gt;“Uhhh, it was just the one shot I think…” She replied unsure, “I wasn’t paying too much attention.”
&gt;Rynard gave a gruff sigh.
&gt;
&gt;“Right, I’ll have to get him to the medical wing then… Follow me.” Rynard instructed, hefting Xant up into one arm, carrying the doctor on his hip.
&gt;
&gt;“Is- is Xant going to be okay?” Jasmine asked, beginning to feel the panic creeping in.
&gt;
&gt;“He’s suffering from VEFS, it’s better we get him down to medical before something permanent happens.” The Captain stated, then turned towards the door. “He’s taken enough depressors to counteract a Freq bomb.” 
&gt;
&gt;“A Freq*bomb*?” Jasmine gulped.
&gt;Rynard nodded,
&gt;
&gt;“It’s not going to kill him, but he might be disorientated if he wakes without proper care. Big heads are sensitive like that.”
&gt;Jasmine nodded, reaching for Sigi’s leash and pulling her nose out of the pesto.
&gt;
&gt;“Come on girl.” She whispered, trying to hold her panic at bay.
&gt;Rynard tapped the button on his collar, activating his Coms unit.
&gt;
&gt;---
&gt;
&gt;**Capt Rynard**: Dr Krydon, this is Captain Ryanrd. I’ve found Dr Xant unconscious from VEFS and possible Depressor doses, please ready a pod for treatment. I’ll be bringing the Subject Jasmine in for testing too. She’s emitting minor Freq, non threatening levels, Specimen Sieglinde’s condition is normal. ETA 4 minutes.
&gt;
&gt;---
&gt;
&gt;He deactivated the Coms and attempted a smile.
&gt;
&gt;“It’s probably nothing, but, better to wait in medical then here-” The Captain finally noticed the picnic arrangement on the floor.
&gt;
&gt;“Were you?... Eating ‘Chta?”
&gt;
&gt;“Umm yeah?”
&gt;
&gt;“Uh-huh…” Rynard paused, “Any Taasai there?”
&gt;
&gt;“No, but, shouldn’t we be getting down to the medical wing?” Jasmine queried.
&gt;
&gt;“Oh, right.” The security guard turned quickly and headed out the door. 
&gt;
&gt;Jasmine knew to follow closely, but snatched up the last of her Min-mojito. 
&gt;
&gt;Wishing the rum was really there.
