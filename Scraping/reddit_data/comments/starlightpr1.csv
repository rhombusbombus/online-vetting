4-15 Amos Ave &amp; 340-358 Erb St W
Signet Group (formerly Starlight Investments) 

Currently living in this complex since June 2022. Paid $1400/mo now it's $1435. One bedroom. Apartment was renovated before I moved in. At first glance it was great! But slowly, issues started cropping up. It took months to get my dishwasher fixed so it didn't flood my kitchen and a hole was left in my wall under the sink which got fixed late 2023, holes had to get patched, and now the paint is peeling off the door frames.

But slowly, issues started cropping up. It took months to get my dishwasher fixed so it didn&amp;#39;t flood my kitchen and a hole was left in my wall under the sink which got fixed late 2023, holes had to get patched, and now the paint is peeling off the door frames.

Winry, Hawkry, and Rory, still on the train

Smoke

The town is on fire

We still don't know who this mask guy is. This is now like the third or fourth time we've seen him.

Colonel Herschel

Well, there it is

The Black Bats are having their way with everyone 

Edward asks the guards if there's anymore underground chambers

The guards taunt him by basically saying ""Wouldn't you like to know, loverboy?""

But it was a distraction for Al to free them

Edward turned himself into a pipe. Funniest shit I've ever seen.

Telling Soyuz they're coming to whoop his behind

But Soyuz also has the Black Bats to worry about 

Edward and Alward, on the run

Ooh, Julia a Black Bat [](#awe)

Edward telling her this is all a big trap

Julia responds by telling her to leave saying they will proceed forward foe the sake of their future 

She is the night 

Well, so far they're doing good 

Gonna hide underground after paralyzing Soyuz's troops, Soyuz finds out

It appears they must escape

The tower

The Star of Blood is seemingly there

Whelp, Soyuz's second-in-command is dead

The Black Bats are in the tower now

Also, Ashley is a Black Bat now as well

The voice pipe to relay orders

That's the thing Edward turned himself into, which as established was the funniest thing 

It hosts the secret of the Sacred Land

HOLY SHIT

ASHLEY JUST STABBED MIRANDA WHAT THE FUCK

I legitimately just shouted holy shit for my entire house to hear

Julia being held back

Ashley is making Miranda's blood go through thr voice pipe 

So much for Miranda having rights

Ashley says there isn't a single drop of blood that isn't useful 

This is a three-dimensional Transmutation Circle drawn with blood of living humans 

Honestly, this isn't Edward's idealism being proven right. Ashley's just an asshole.

Now Ashley is being called First Lieutenant Atlas

Sergeant Raul

And he gets stabbed as well 

Taking no prisoners

Ashley requires more blood for the blood orgy

Oh man. He's walking over to Julia...

He wouldn't... would he?

It turns out this isn't Julia's brother after all

He's the one who killed Julia's parents 

They both have the torso tattoos

He ripped off her brother's skin and placed the map on himself 

He killed her brother 

And now he's putting the ripped brother skin he has onto Julia

Dude...

Shiny thing that looks like something out of Revue Starlight 

People are falling 

MIRANDA

SHE STABBED ATLAS

And he proceeds to stab her one final time, officially killing her

Shame. Ahead was the most interesting new character in the movie. 

EDWARD WITH THE PUNCH

LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO [](#SPORTS)

Blood pouring out

Bells ringing 

The Star has been forged, he says

Guiding Julia down, Edward and Al are 

Herschel says a new era shall begin 

I predict that Herschel is Ashley this whole time

A bunch of explosions

The tower just got destroyed 

And now lava is flowing everywhere 

Julia saying this wasn't a part of the deal, brother

Al says he's going to block the Magma 

Atlas going to see his Star of Blood giddy like a kid on Christmas morning 

Edward tries to prevent it, but Atlas manages to get it

Some more amazing action, this time between Edward and Atlas

Julia now has the Star of Blood

False advertising, it's neither a star nor red viscous fluid

Edward telling her to throw it into the Magma 

But she wants to save the valley

Edward is trying to tell her that the Star will devour her soul

But too late. She eats it.

Atlas trying to get the Star back

But she's just as powerful now

This is giving me Star Wars vibes

She says if this place didn't exist, her parents wouldn't have perished 

Herschel removing his little contraption from him

It's time for him to get involved 

Al blocking the Magma with a wall

He hopes it holds up

Roy wondering what Soyuz is doing 

His best, okay?

Edward and Julia 

Julia now kinda looks like Gamo-chsn from Nagatoro

Edward tells Roy that the Table City has fulfilled its purpose of creating a Philosopher's Stone 

Soyuz trying to sniper Edward 

But he gets noticed 

Roy orders his arrest

As this is going on, however, Julia seemingly has other plans

Julia is going to stop the Magma!

Winry

Gotta repair Edward's arm, and fast 

She only has tool for adjustment and not replacement, though 

And now Edward is flying with Winry on his back!

Okay, that's cool

Roy is going as well 

The town evacuating 

He asks Gon to fix his arm

He seems to recognize Winry

Al still trying to hold things up 

Julia

Nah, Al, I'd say she swallowed the Star of Blood given the glowing red eyes

Atlas trying to cause more trouble 

But Herschel intercepts!

Ashley Crichton 

Yep, called it

That's why he's wearing the mask

He survived using the Star of Blood his parents hid for their research 

""You can apologize to my parents in the underworld!""

Bit harsh to imply his parents are in hell 

Dude... he crushed his head

He popped his head like a pimple

Julia asks Ashley why didn't he let her know he was alive 

It was so he could kill the man who murdered his parents 

The wolf-chimeras were actually meant to protect them

Weird way of protecting them. That's like a tsundere showing their love by punching their crush in the face.

Last tsundere reference of the rewatch [](#sadholo)

Ashley asks Julia to come with him to Cleta, but Cleta says that isn't her home

Ashley points out that the people of this valley called their parents traitors 

""This valley has no future.""

Julia wants to create one, however, with blackjack and hookers 

Ashley scolds her for wasting her time

He's going to send an army to bury this valley

He's going to make the Sacred Land his

So much for him being a good guy 

Edward and Royward, walking like a couple of badasses

Edward says the ruins of Milos have been destroyed 

Ashley seems pleased with this development 

He'll simply rebuild the Star's Transmutation Circle, he says

It's crazy to think that this rewatch has been going on for almost 4 months now and u/Star4ace had a Transmutation Circle this entire time 

He's going to use the Star to open the Gate of Truth 

Ashley, that is, not Star4ace 

Says the Truth is the only object of value 

Edward says the Star he swallowed has consumed his soul

""Become yourself again!""

How about no?

The Magma 

Ashley doesn't seem to care about killing his sister

The Magma flowing into the water

Water in the fire WHY?!? WHY WATER IN THE FIRE?!? I don't understand. 

Ashley pleading Ashley to go with him

""A mountain of trash it may be, but the world isn't ugly.""

She's telling her brother her grain tastes delightful while his grain tastes very frightful 

Ashley condemns Ashley for being no different from everyone else

SHE'S BLOCKING THE MAGMA!

Edward and Al trying to help her

""Julia, if you can't understand how I feel... then you can go down with this valley!""

Julia using her power to grow a hand made of Magma

&lt;p&gt;I legitimately just shouted holy shit for my entire house to hear&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia being held back&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley is making Miranda&amp;#39;s blood go through thr voice pipe &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much for Miranda having rights&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley says there isn&amp;#39;t a single drop of blood that isn&amp;#39;t useful &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a three-dimensional Transmutation Circle drawn with blood of living humans &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, this isn&amp;#39;t Edward&amp;#39;s idealism being proven right. Ashley&amp;#39;s just an asshole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Ashley is being called First Lieutenant Atlas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sergeant Raul&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he gets stabbed as well &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking no prisoners&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley requires more blood for the blood orgy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh man. He&amp;#39;s walking over to Julia...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He wouldn&amp;#39;t... would he?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out this isn&amp;#39;t Julia&amp;#39;s brother after all&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s the one who killed Julia&amp;#39;s parents &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They both have the torso tattoos&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He ripped off her brother&amp;#39;s skin and placed the map on himself &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He killed her brother &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now he&amp;#39;s putting the ripped brother skin he has onto Julia&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dude...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shiny thing that looks like something out of Revue Starlight &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are falling &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIRANDA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHE STABBED ATLAS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he proceeds to stab her one final time, officially killing her&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shame. Ahead was the most interesting new character in the movie. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDWARD WITH THE PUNCH&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LET&amp;#39;S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO &lt;a href=""#SPORTS""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blood pouring out&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bells ringing &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Star has been forged, he says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guiding Julia down, Edward and Al are &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herschel says a new era shall begin &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I predict that Herschel is Ashley this whole time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bunch of explosions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tower just got destroyed &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now lava is flowing everywhere &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia saying this wasn&amp;#39;t a part of the deal, brother&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al says he&amp;#39;s going to block the Magma &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atlas going to see his Star of Blood giddy like a kid on Christmas morning &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward tries to prevent it, but Atlas manages to get it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more amazing action, this time between Edward and Atlas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia now has the Star of Blood&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;False advertising, it&amp;#39;s neither a star nor red viscous fluid&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward telling her to throw it into the Magma &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she wants to save the valley&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward is trying to tell her that the Star will devour her soul&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But too late. She eats it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atlas trying to get the Star back&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But she&amp;#39;s just as powerful now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is giving me Star Wars vibes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She says if this place didn&amp;#39;t exist, her parents wouldn&amp;#39;t have perished &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Herschel removing his little contraption from him&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s time for him to get involved &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al blocking the Magma with a wall&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He hopes it holds up&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roy wondering what Soyuz is doing &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His best, okay?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward and Julia &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia now kinda looks like Gamo-chsn from Nagatoro&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward tells Roy that the Table City has fulfilled its purpose of creating a Philosopher&amp;#39;s Stone &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soyuz trying to sniper Edward &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But he gets noticed &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roy orders his arrest&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As this is going on, however, Julia seemingly has other plans&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia is going to stop the Magma!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gotta repair Edward&amp;#39;s arm, and fast &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She only has tool for adjustment and not replacement, though &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now Edward is flying with Winry on his back!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, that&amp;#39;s cool&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roy is going as well &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town evacuating &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He asks Gon to fix his arm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He seems to recognize Winry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al still trying to hold things up &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nah, Al, I&amp;#39;d say she swallowed the Star of Blood given the glowing red eyes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atlas trying to cause more trouble &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Herschel intercepts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley Crichton &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep, called it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why he&amp;#39;s wearing the mask&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He survived using the Star of Blood his parents hid for their research &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You can apologize to my parents in the underworld!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bit harsh to imply his parents are in hell &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dude... he crushed his head&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He popped his head like a pimple&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia asks Ashley why didn&amp;#39;t he let her know he was alive &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was so he could kill the man who murdered his parents &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wolf-chimeras were actually meant to protect them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weird way of protecting them. That&amp;#39;s like a tsundere showing their love by punching their crush in the face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last tsundere reference of the rewatch &lt;a href=""#sadholo""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley asks Julia to come with him to Cleta, but Cleta says that isn&amp;#39;t her home&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley points out that the people of this valley called their parents traitors &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This valley has no future.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia wants to create one, however, with blackjack and hookers &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley scolds her for wasting her time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s going to send an army to bury this valley&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s going to make the Sacred Land his&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much for him being a good guy &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward and Royward, walking like a couple of badasses&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward says the ruins of Milos have been destroyed &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley seems pleased with this development &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;ll simply rebuild the Star&amp;#39;s Transmutation Circle, he says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s crazy to think that this rewatch has been going on for almost 4 months now and &lt;a href=""/u/Star4ace""&gt;u/Star4ace&lt;/a&gt; had a Transmutation Circle this entire time &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s going to use the Star to open the Gate of Truth &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley, that is, not Star4ace &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Says the Truth is the only object of value &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward says the Star he swallowed has consumed his soul&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Become yourself again!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about no?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Magma &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley doesn&amp;#39;t seem to care about killing his sister&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Magma flowing into the water&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water in the fire WHY?!? WHY WATER IN THE FIRE?!? I don&amp;#39;t understand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley pleading Ashley to go with him&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A mountain of trash it may be, but the world isn&amp;#39;t ugly.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s telling her brother her grain tastes delightful while his grain tastes very frightful &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley condemns Ashley for being no different from everyone else&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHE&amp;#39;S BLOCKING THE MAGMA!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward and Al trying to help her&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Julia, if you can&amp;#39;t understand how I feel... then you can go down with this valley!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia using her power to grow a hand made of Magma&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ran out of space. Part seven in the replies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His daughter decided to go to magic college, and even as an adventurer he could not foot the bill, so he went with her to the town where the college stands and requested work there. Working for the college nets free tuition if the applicant passes all classes. At first they denied him, but when they saw the various slimes he had tamed and cultivated, many not of this world, they relented and assigned him to the monster infested sewers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has been fighting the good fight in the city’s underbelly ever since. His daughter went on to become an Ooze Lich, but that’s a story for another time.&lt;/p&gt;

Any time I found a mod that I became interested in there was a 99% chance of it disappearing by next time we played a world because it didn&amp;#39;t make their numbers go up faster and the recipes didn&amp;#39;t take twenty steps.&lt;/p&gt;

  \- Wolfepack - Newer spot close to downtown.  Texas style brisket (thicker cut, better rendering, better char/rub) has always been better than traditional brisket found in KC.  These guys have great burnt ends and brisket.  Actually everything they have is great.

\- Harp BBQ - Another new spot that is superb.  A little bit out of the way for many but well worth the trip.  If you are coming from out of town and decide to hit up a Royals game, this would be a great pairing.

\- Chef J BBQ.  Another new spot that's great.  It's in the West Bottoms, in a cool spot.  

\- Q39.  They were the ""new guy"" but have been around for 10 + years now.  It's good but on the ""bougie"" side of KC BBQ.

\- Joes KC.  Still have great Q but have slid down the list with some of the newer, superior entries.

\- Danny Edwards.  Their hours suck (11-3 M-Sat) but this has always been my personal favorite.  The quality of the burnt ends might not be as good as the top 3, but the combination of the cut, smoke flavor, sauce, and fries make their burnt end plate my favorite BBQ meal in town.  People like Joe's fries, but Danny's has the best fries in town.

&amp;#x200B;

As for music venues we have some good ones, though our promoters suck and our calendar has been pitiful the last 3-5 years.  The crown jewels is Starlight Amp, an amazing venue with the best outdoor sound you'll find anywhere.  After that you have Knuckleheads, a traditional blues, rock, Americana saloon venue that is super unique.  They also upgraded their sound systems, which was direly needed.  The upgrade is very noticeable compared to what it was before.

Best Venues:

\-Starlight Amp.  See above

\- Knucklheads.  See above as well.

\- The Madrid.  800ish person venue with good sound and sightlines.  Also close to evening spots.

\- Uptown Theatre.  2000-2300 seated to mixed GA/seated venue.  I think the sound is more consistent than the Midland, though when the Midland dials in the sound it's better.  Best sound is in the lower balcony seats.  

\- The Midland Theatre.  Mixed GA/balcony seated venue.  The inside is beautiful and it's located right downtown.  The sound can vary wildly from trash (Tash Sultana) to amazing (FKJ was the best sounding show I've seen there out of about 50 shows).  I'd avoid the balcony as it's too cavernous (compared to the Uptown).  Pro tip - If 21 or over go to the Indie on Main, the bar next door beofre the show.  Get a drink (or two), then when doors enter go in on the entrance from the bar.  This relly comes in handy for shows that draw a younger crowd.  You can show up 10 minutes before doors and get in quicker than the teenagers that have been waiting outside for hours.  

\- Kauffman Center - It's our performing arts venue DT.  Sometimes pop acts play there.  An awesome experience is watching a movie where the orch plays the score.  The more horns and percussion in the score, the cooler the experience.

\- Recordbar - 400ish person venue DT that has awesome owners.  

&amp;#x200B;

Okay venues:

\- Truman - Club style venue near downtown that books a lot of indie/alt and EDM acts.  We desderved a club venue built from scratch but got this instead.  Okay sound but excellent ventilation, especially in the summer when most indoor venues get hot.

\- Bottleneck - 600ish person venue in Lawrence (which is 30 miles from DT KC).

\- Liberty Hall - Probably could have moved it up top but they don't have a ton of shows there.  As someone else mentioned Isbell will be there.  That's sold out and would need to be bought off the secondary.

\- Sprint/Tmobile Center - Typical arena that's DT

\- Grinders - Outdoor venue that has a great location.  The owner is a tool, the sound is iffy, and the sightlines can stink, especially with a permanent soundstage they erected in the center of the crowd.

&amp;#x200B;

Avoid:

\- Azura Amp - Crappy, large outdoor amp.  Basically Mammoth uses it as a cash cow as they have a sweetheart deal with Bonner Springs.  It's run down, overpriced...just garbage.  Avoid at all costs.

&amp;#x200B;

Are you sure that you will run out of SP? You should equip Bronya's LC also on Sparkle which is great. Sparkle with ERR and Bronya LC has (55+30)\*1.296=110 Energy which is enough for an ultimate after the first skill and after that's it's ultimate every 3 Skill uses. Starting with Technique means you go into the fight with 6 SP. There should be an SP positive sustain or no sustain at all meaning Luocha or Pela. That's Sparke 3 Actions, -3 + 4 SP = 0.33 SP each rotation, Tingyun Skill Basic basic is another 0.33 SP each rotation and Luocha/Pela is +1SP flat. With 3EBA each rotation that's a loss of 1.33 SP. With 6 SP starting, another one from Bronya LC with the first ultimate usage it's 7. You get 5 rotations until you run out of SP which is another SP from Bronya LC that's 8 and thus actually 8/1.33=6 rotations. With 134 SPD that's 4 cycles. So just blow it. The enemies will be dead for sure. :) You could also use Bronya LC on Tingyun for even more SP if needed. It's the best investment in the starlight store anyways.

&gt;I also hope the Kafka + BS team is going to be SS levels, especially with Ruan Mei. I just got Kafka this banner, and will be getting Black Swan too. Can't wait!

If Black Swan comes in with the amount of def ignore in her set I think it will be great.

&gt;Thinking about it, in your rotation, I think doing 3EBA on Sparkle's buff will be better. If you do Sparkle's ult on DHIL's turn (before Bronya skills him), he should have her ult buff 2 out of 3 Sparkle skill-buffed turns. With Sparkle wearing Bronya's or Past and Future LC, that is quite a bit of dmg% buff, on top of the crit dmg buff. Whereas Bronya can only give you dmg% buff, except her ult, but that only lasts for 1 out of 3 Bronya skill-buffed turns.

Good point. It's a bit up to trial and error and see how it goes. The thing is that Sparkle has to move before Bronya because anything else would require insane amounts of SPD gear and SPD tuning which I don't have and can't do. If I start the fight Daniel Ult will be up after the first 3EBA. This means I either use it directly after the first 3EBA or I will use it on Bronya buff and then use the 3EBA with Daniel's own stack boost already stacked up by 3. I will leave this to testing.

1. Really that's a great connection with the dew to the Albinaurics, I think the blooming blossoms in the Aeonian Swamp must've interacted unexpectedly with the dew from the Needle! Another note is from the Dewkissed Herba:

&gt; **A herb that grows in the false night in and around the Eternal City**. Material used for crafting items. **Soaked in arcane dew, it gives off the faint glow of starlight.**

The Amber Starlight with life that comes from stars, Numen from other worlds/spirit worlds, and even the Fallingstar Beasts/Malformed Stars/Astels that come from the abyss of space to grow in the Lands Between all suggest at otherworldly origins for specific life forms.

2. I'm really interested in this question of yours:

&gt; How Miquella was supposed to know about the secret time-out zone is beyond me but he seemed to be one of the smartest and well informed fellas around. 

Perhaps Miquella didn't know about the storm, but surely he would've known about the prophecy of the kindling Maiden, if it's so well-known that several Finger maidens seek to become the kindling for the next lord? We know of Bernahl the Beast Champion and Vyke having maidens but Bernahl's failed, Vyke's was abandoned by him. Therefore Miquella *must* have known about this path to the Elden Throne, I think this shows a deliberate choice to not pursue that path at least, which raises more questions. Miquella seems to follow his own path, perhaps its as simple as that, but he also cleaves towards the arcane and that in itself may have naturally led him to the Formless Mother.

3. Going back to your first comment, what bothers me about Millicent's story is how Gowry states in no uncertain terms that WE must be the ones to deal the killing blow to Millicent in order for her to bloom and become a Scarlet Valkyrie. The betrayal is what 'nurtures' her bud, and also he mentions ""Millicent, following in the footsteps of her mother, no matter what.""

Was it a betrayal from Miquella that drove Malenia to abandon the Needle? If she lost her pride and sense of self in the aftermath, did she forget her fury that caused her to blossom, hence her dialogue when we encounter her at the roots of the Haligtree? Perhaps Miquella's departure itself both drove Malenia to Radahn and to abandoning the Needle when she realized Radahn didn't have Miquella, maybe she only went to Radahn because she sensed Miquella just below the surface in the Mohgywn Palace...",[],,0,DaDa2BbDa3T,False,False,"[{'a': ':DaS:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/49vhiunb71q81_t5_13b59f/DaS'}, {'a': ':DaS2:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/2ijbap4d71q81_t5_13b59f/DaS2'}, {'a': ':Bb:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/gmb533aa71q81_t5_13b59f/Bb'}, {'a': ':DaS3:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/t167clae71q81_t5_13b59f/DaS3'}]",False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazing couple of comments and they&amp;#39;ve given me some new thoughts, I&amp;#39;ll organize them by topic.&lt;/p&gt;

Therefore Miquella &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; have known about this path to the Elden Throne, I think this shows a deliberate choice to not pursue that path at least, which raises more questions. Miquella seems to follow his own path, perhaps its as simple as that, but he also cleaves towards the arcane and that in itself may have naturally led him to the Formless Mother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Going back to your first comment, what bothers me about Millicent&amp;#39;s story is how Gowry states in no uncertain terms that WE must be the ones to deal the killing blow to Millicent in order for her to bloom and become a Scarlet Valkyrie. The betrayal is what &amp;#39;nurtures&amp;#39; her bud, and also he mentions &amp;quot;Millicent, following in the footsteps of her mother, no matter what.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was it a betrayal from Miquella that drove Malenia to abandon the Needle? If she lost her pride and sense of self in the aftermath, did she forget her fury that caused her to blossom, hence her dialogue when we encounter her at the roots of the Haligtree? Perhaps Miquella&amp;#39;s departure itself both drove Malenia to Radahn and to abandoning the Needle when she realized Radahn didn&amp;#39;t have Miquella, maybe she only went to Radahn because she sensed Miquella just below the surface in the Mohgywn Palace...&lt;/p&gt;

No idea, when you decide on a controller, check what software it's bundled with and its hardware requirements. In general DJ software isn't too demanding on hardware.
Re: cables - the controller should come with a USB cable, you will need something to connect the speakers and some headphones.

No, i'm pretty sure Apple Music is a no-go.

There are a couple of streaming services that work with DJ software like Tidal, Beatsource or Soundcloud GO+ but any DJ worth their salt will not rely on streaming for their main library.
Might work for testing the waters, but in reality buying music is the way to go.

Another option is looking for free downloads, plenty of artists and labels do those, but you need to dig. Bandcamp and soundcloud is the place to look.   

One further note, double check what streaming service works with software of your choice, not all do in all software.

Even though LSD played here in December they hadn't played here in FIVE fucking years prior to that.  Right on with King Gizz, who is also playing in Arkansas.  LCD Soundsystem,  King Gizz, Khru, LSD, Andrew Bird, Depeche Mode, New Order, Colin Hay, Local Natives, the list goes on of artist who have either never played here, play here sporadically, skipped us multiple times, or played much smaller markets surrounding us. 

Mammoth is such a terrible promoter.  I've heard they treat artists well and develop some relationships...great.  But they book the same artists over and over again and often it's retreads like Blue October or Andrew McMahon that tour regularly.  There is a rarity if anything ""fresh"" that comes here.  Occasionally the Truman nabs something like Goth Babe last year but that's infrequent.  The Granasty's calendar is nonexistant, the Recordbars calendar has dropped off, Starlight wastes dates with crap like Train, and even the Sprint Center/Tmo  Center gets skipped for Tulsa or Omaha regularly. 

Probably the most irritating omissions are Depeche Mode and Khhru.  Did you know Depeche Mode has played KC ONCE since 1987?  It was the debacle at Stsrlight in the late 2000s where Dave was still on drugs and left the stage after 4 songs.  How in the fuck is that possible?  A show would sell out instantly as nobody has seen them for years without traveling. Yet they avoid this area like the plague.  

Sadly some apathy has set in...noticeably...as some shows don't have the attendance they used to.  I literally think some have given up with the lack of quality shows, terrible promotion (unnavigable websites, inconsistent emails, and awful social media presence), and or shows being at the wrong venue.  Mammoth bought the Uptown and the Madrid and mostly book cheap crap there.  The Midland has largely turned into an oversized comedy club...the list goes on.  

If the times were different I'd love to start a promotion company and book shows.  Everyone here outside the EDM people are doing it all wrong.  Sadly everything is so political anymore, with LNs monopoly, Mammoths stranglehold, AEG etc that it's hard to start something now.   We are consistently getting our asses handed to us by the NW Arks, Tulsa, Des Moines, and even Omaha.  They have the right people making good decisions while we don't.

&lt;p&gt;Even though LSD played here in December they hadn&amp;#39;t played here in FIVE fucking years prior to that.  Right on with King Gizz, who is also playing in Arkansas.  LCD Soundsystem,  King Gizz, Khru, LSD, Andrew Bird, Depeche Mode, New Order, Colin Hay, Local Natives, the list goes on of artist who have either never played here, play here sporadically, skipped us multiple times, or played much smaller markets surrounding us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mammoth is such a terrible promoter.  I&amp;#39;ve heard they treat artists well and develop some relationships...great.  But they book the same artists over and over again and often it&amp;#39;s retreads like Blue October or Andrew McMahon that tour regularly.  There is a rarity if anything &amp;quot;fresh&amp;quot; that comes here.  Occasionally the Truman nabs something like Goth Babe last year but that&amp;#39;s infrequent.  The Granasty&amp;#39;s calendar is nonexistant, the Recordbars calendar has dropped off, Starlight wastes dates with crap like Train, and even the Sprint Center/Tmo  Center gets skipped for Tulsa or Omaha regularly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the most irritating omissions are Depeche Mode and Khhru.  Did you know Depeche Mode has played KC ONCE since 1987?  It was the debacle at Stsrlight in the late 2000s where Dave was still on drugs and left the stage after 4 songs.  How in the fuck is that possible?  A show would sell out instantly as nobody has seen them for years without traveling. Yet they avoid this area like the plague.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly some apathy has set in...noticeably...as some shows don&amp;#39;t have the attendance they used to.  I literally think some have given up with the lack of quality shows, terrible promotion (unnavigable websites, inconsistent emails, and awful social media presence), and or shows being at the wrong venue.  Mammoth bought the Uptown and the Madrid and mostly book cheap crap there.  The Midland has largely turned into an oversized comedy club...the list goes on.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the times were different I&amp;#39;d love to start a promotion company and book shows.  Everyone here outside the EDM people are doing it all wrong.  Sadly everything is so political anymore, with LNs monopoly, Mammoths stranglehold, AEG etc that it&amp;#39;s hard to start something now.   We are consistently getting our asses handed to us by the NW Arks, Tulsa, Des Moines, and even Omaha.  They have the right people making good decisions while we don&amp;#39;t.  &lt;/p&gt;

Making her a tertiary force to Akatosh and Lorkhan is very bold. I wonder if they'll make it work.

I wouldn't be so sure about her being the tertiary force - if anything, the third force to Akatosh and Lorkhan would be Magnus. Consider this part:

&gt;outside and separate from the Tri-Nymic, yet crucial to all three.

So she's not the third force, but a fourth force alongside the three main ones (again, I'm assuming the third is Magnus).

Likewise, I don't think that the revelation Lorkhan saw was Ithelia herself, but rather that Magnus crafted her based on the revelation that Lorkhan saw first:

&gt;\-- not only -- Anui-El and Sithis -- harmony within duality; unity of opposites -- that contained starlight and endless possibility beyond cosmic interplay. **He named her** \-- the Colors of Light -- the madness of the Time God and the first challenge of his shadow, who in nothingness saw those endless possibilities first.

Consider the other Coruscants and how they were all crafted by Magnus (or Sotha Sil, in Memory's case): Meridia - crafted from Light without Love; Londa-Vera - crafter from Light within Love, from the best aspects of all goddesses; and of course Mnemo-li/Memory being crafter by Sotha Sil, seemingly from the concept of uncertainty, as was his greatest wish.

Hence, Ithelia isn't literally what Lorkhan saw, but an artificially constructed personification of his revalation, because that's just apparently what all great mages do... No, seriously, Magnus, Sotha Sil, Divayth Fyr, arguably Xarxes - what's with all these mages deciding ""yeah, my magnum opus will be crafting daughter(s) for myself"". At this point we should just consider it yet another mythic patters. :P

On a side-note, this part is funny:

&gt;Thus we must -- against Man -- that our violence might bring forth a Numinous Paravant, who may with unbound hands echo forth the Prime Archon's endeavor.

This heavily implied to be an ayleid text. Which just said that their ""violence against Man"" is meant ""bring forth a Numinous Paravant"". So... Does that mean that all their terrible treatment of their nedic slaves was a giant-ass ritual meant to force the universe to spawn Alessia?

For the last number of years I was using some cheap barringer controllers with Traktor and MIXXX, but I was getting tired of having to constantly play with my controller mappings to get things to happen the way I wanted to. I got to the point I just wanted a simpler controller that I can plug in and go.

I did extensive research, and also considered an Inpulse 500, but I felt like for the same money I could get an FLX4. The big thing that won me over to Pioneer was the software. Software is such an important part of the decision you make when you decide to invest in a controller.

I've said all over the place how I lost faith with Native Instruments, and wanted to make the switch to another title. I also have spoken about previous setups I've had that were quietly discontinued and how disgusted I was that I had to then turn around and invest in something new.  

I feel like for as many people that trash on Pioneer for how much sway they have in the industry, I like the idea that at least Rekordbox is going to be around for a long time. Hercules has inexpensive controllers and I do own a Starlight which I find to be a lot of fun, but I didn't want to have to suddenly invest more money to subscribe and get licensing for software. I would probably toss out there the Hercules if somebody really wants to get Virtual DJ, but for me the fact that the $300 that FLX4 costed also gets you a hardware unlocked to the core version of Rekordbox was a solid sale for me.

I've had the FLX4 since Christmas and I love it. I'm having so much fun with it. And I'm so impressed with how robust this controller is. The only downside I would give to this controller is for those who want four channels something I've heard called a quad drop, it's obviously not ideal. Yet I think this thing sounds great and feels wonderful. 

I'm also pretty impressed with Rekordbox. Granted they need to improve their stem separation, but I got faith it'll happen.

I don't know if in the long run the FLX4 will be ideal for you, but I do feel at least you'll be using Rekordbox which is ideal to have in your arsenal even if you decide to go to Serato or some other title. But you still need to be able to fix up your mp3s for a club that's on Pioneer gear. 

I think the Hercules controllers have some strengths and their great for hobbyists and those wanting to play around, but it's that software issue that turns me off from it.  

You know, if you really want to do hip hop and you suddenly get more into scratching and tricking, you might end up wanting one of those Rev controllers or the new Inpulse with the motorized platters. 

Regardless, I would suggest to start with the FLX4 and go from there. Lord knows if after one or two years you decide it's not the controller for you.

Not in marni: kratuga, sycria. Biraghi is going to be the most dangerous when weapon is in cooldown and kratuga would be easiest.  
You want to grind from kratuga sets of artifacts: 2 x monster ap, 2 x melee ap, 2 x all evasion, 2 x all damage reduction. For the monster ap set you want to slot the 18 monster ap lightstone set, for the melee ap set you want to slot the human damage set, for the evasion set you want to slot the evasion set (centaur), for the damage reduction set you want to slot the damage reduction set (4 x damage reduction lightstones).  
You want to use the monster ap set in kratuga, sycria and stars end. (Ultimately you swap the artifacts to kabua artifacts and all-out attack lightstone set, but not for a long time).  
You want to use the human damage set at biraghi (other upgrades are more important, use the monster ap until you one day get this one).  
You want to use the damage reduction set in pvp when fighting someone with similar gear.  
You want to use the evasion set later on when you are 401 dp or more.  
From biraghi den you want the yellow shard drops. Once you have a little bit more dp you can grind swamp fogans and make accessory cups to use or sell. And once you are much more geared you can go to orcs for red shards and a lot more money.  
Stars end is likely not a great choice, because it is heavily reliant on high trash / hour and high droprate. Neither which you get with your gear and having not yet worked on droprate.  
Sycria is stable money and you drop a lot of caphras and abyssal essence. If you are willing to lifeskill a bit you can save money by making frenzy draughts for you to use.  
In my honest opinion you want to stick to sycria and kratuga to beef up your defenses and then do some biraghi and fogans and sell a few cups. If you have members for party grind, castle ruins is excellent way to get red shards and also imps for blue shards. Combining 3 shards at the rate of 50, 50 and 100 you can make a cup that sells for 5 billion silver each. Elvia spots are also far better xp than most grind spots in the game.  
But there is another spot which becomes relevant fairly soon. Jade starlight forest is a favorite of a lot of people for burning agris.  
And I somehow forgot, but striker awakening is one of the better aakman classes. If you are a foolhardy gambler and want to enhance a lot, the desert drops a lot of ancient scrolls, which you can do for some what cheaper memory fragments.

&lt;p&gt;The only verified report of any night vision equipment used on helicopters in Vietnam was that of one member of one of the forums I frequent that reported that, as a crew chief of a UH-1, they once carried a sniper with an M-16 with a mounted starlight scope on a night run to see if it could be of any use in finding enemy personnel on the ground at night. The bulky starlight scope of the time was pretty useless because of the rapid movements and vibrations of the helicopter and ended pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you, or anyone else with similar or better credentials as mine have anything more than anecdotal sensationalized information on the subject I would really like to hear about it. Otherwise my participation in this subject is complete and done. And I stand by my writing.&lt;/p&gt;

Starlight is similar in that it’s basically a big field with no shade. You can pay extra to camp here, the only vehicles allowed are permanently camperized like RVs/camper vans/motor homes.

Metta is no vehicles camping. It’s starts just past the second entry point to downtown, and ends way way back, I would say 15-20 mins to get to the back of Metta.

The film's score was composed by Frank DeVol and includes selections from Beethoven's ""Symphony No. 5 in C minor"", Mendelssohn's ""Wedding March in C major"", ""Aloha 'Oe"" (written by Queen Liliuokalani) and Goldsmith's ""Theme from The Man from U.N.C.L.E.""
Day sings a shortened version of ""Soft as the Starlight"" (written by Joe Lubin and Jerome Howard), which she previously sang in its entirety on the 1957 album Day by Night. The song ""The Glass Bottom Boat"" is a rearrangement of ""Soft as the Starlight"" with completely different lyrics and is heard twice in the film: over the opening credits, sung by Day, and again as source music sung by Day, Taylor, Godfrey and Fraser. Day also sings a single verse from her signature song, ""Whatever Will Be, Will Be (Que Sera, Sera)"" (written by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans). Dick Martin sings a brief a cappella rendition of  ""Be My Love"" (written by Sammy Cahn and Nicholas Brodszky).

Masser/Jode has been visited twice in the form of the Demiplane of Jode and Jode's Core, the former being a sub-realm of some sort which transforms itself to manifest the challenges it's visitors might face in their futures and the latter being a section of the plane where some sort of divine core for Jode is housed.

[https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:The\_Demi-Plane\_of\_Jode](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:The_Demi-Plane_of_Jode)

https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Plane\_of\_Jode

The Den of Lorkhaj/Dark Moon has also been seen directly, visited right after the Demiplane of Jode.

https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Den\_of\_Lorkhaj

There appears to be no temporal distortion to the degree of time being frozen or such, the planes do appear to house life to some degree (glowing flowers, nixads and the undead Khajiit guarding the realm in Jode's Core, and whatever ""life"" the realm manifests in the Demiplane of Jode).

Other than the transformation undergone by the Demiplane of Jode the most peculiar planar phenomenon we witness is that the celestial topography as seen from the Demiplane of Jode does not at all match the one seen from Jode's Core even though nominally they are both ""of Jode"" (the skies from the Core are red and filled with very different celestial bodies when compared to the more ""common"" sky of the Demiplane).

Another possible visit to an Aedric realm is the Spilled Sand seen in *Dragonhold* and accessed through invoking the Mask of Alkosh, though Ja'darri does not clearly answer if it is meant to be the realm of Alkosh, saying instead that as all things exist within the tapestry of time which Alkosh weaves/personifies, all things are the realm of time technically.

Nahfahlaar describes the place as ""myth made manifest"" and texts suggest it somehow exists beyond Aetherius and time's tapestry but also somehow ""woven"" all across time, a place that has ""always existed"" but was also ""made real"" and accessible for the rest of creation through Alkosh ""weaving it into the tapestry"" for everyone else at some point.

Interesting elements include an absolutely colossal slumbering golden dragon (described as an aspect or avatar of Alkosh) and solid gold trees/plantlife surrounding an oasis with a giant hourglass at the center, the realm is filled with sand dunes spilling from broken hourglasses and you can see Masser and Secunda in the sky among the various stars (which is itself intriguing because this place is supposedly beyond Aetherius, adding to the number of times the twin moons have appeared in places where they've no business being per normal spatial relations).

Here the temporal distortion might be larger, the Pridehome text suggests that everyone who has touched the realm will exist eternally in some sort of paradox state, as in within time they failed in their goal and died but in the place/state outside time they continue to exist and the outcome of their story has not been decided. 

This is suggested to apply to dragons like Laatvulon and perhaps even dragons more broadly (the event of the world being threatened by dragons is named ""The Doom To Come"" and per the text because of this extratemporal nature even if prevented/ended The Doom To Come will still persist and emerge again to threaten the world), as well as to figures like Abnur Tharn (and by extension presumably Kaalgrontiid).

Lastly, though it's widely believed that the Aedric Plane(t)s are not inhabited, Azandar-al-Cybiades theorizes that the reason Ayleid Wells gather Varliance (starlight magicka) and redirect it towards the skies is that non-mortal someone/s who inhabit the Aedric realms might be gathering it for some reason.

&lt;p&gt;Nahfahlaar describes the place as &amp;quot;myth made manifest&amp;quot; and texts suggest it somehow exists beyond Aetherius and time&amp;#39;s tapestry but also somehow &amp;quot;woven&amp;quot; all across time, a place that has &amp;quot;always existed&amp;quot; but was also &amp;quot;made real&amp;quot; and accessible for the rest of creation through Alkosh &amp;quot;weaving it into the tapestry&amp;quot; for everyone else at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interesting elements include an absolutely colossal slumbering golden dragon (described as an aspect or avatar of Alkosh) and solid gold trees/plantlife surrounding an oasis with a giant hourglass at the center, the realm is filled with sand dunes spilling from broken hourglasses and you can see Masser and Secunda in the sky among the various stars (which is itself intriguing because this place is supposedly beyond Aetherius, adding to the number of times the twin moons have appeared in places where they&amp;#39;ve no business being per normal spatial relations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the temporal distortion might be larger, the Pridehome text suggests that everyone who has touched the realm will exist eternally in some sort of paradox state, as in within time they failed in their goal and died but in the place/state outside time they continue to exist and the outcome of their story has not been decided. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is suggested to apply to dragons like Laatvulon and perhaps even dragons more broadly (the event of the world being threatened by dragons is named &amp;quot;The Doom To Come&amp;quot; and per the text because of this extratemporal nature even if prevented/ended The Doom To Come will still persist and emerge again to threaten the world), as well as to figures like Abnur Tharn (and by extension presumably Kaalgrontiid).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, though it&amp;#39;s widely believed that the Aedric Plane(t)s are not inhabited, Azandar-al-Cybiades theorizes that the reason Ayleid Wells gather Varliance (starlight magicka) and redirect it towards the skies is that non-mortal someone/s who inhabit the Aedric realms might be gathering it for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;

The first one happened 30 years ago. And it was the best and most certain sighting of all. I was with a friend of mine who is an engineer. We were in a bird sanctuary in Massachusetts. There were no lights anywhere in the sky for 5 square miles. Only three houses were on this land because they were grandfathered in. All we saw was starlight. We saw two points of light in the sky appear. At first I thought they were meteors or asteroid’s.  Shooting stars. But as they traveled the horizon we noticed that they were perfectly in sync with each other, and there was no arcing to them. Nor was there a trail of debris behind them. They moved across the sky in a straight line for approximately 10 seconds. At first, I joked that they were shooting stars, and because they’re were two of them we would get two wishes apiece. But as they moved strangely forward, I mentioned how strange it was. He commented that it certainly was weird. After approximately 10 seconds of moving in a straight line, they moved upward at a 90° angle. They did not stop, and they did not curve. And they did this at approximately three times the speed of what we initially saw. After about three more seconds, they pinged out into deep space as if turning off a light. Ping, they were gone. We both knew what we had seen. But because I have always had an awareness of these things, I was not surprised. And seemingly neither was he.

The second time I was outside my house, and actually looking at the sky for something. 10 minutes later, I saw two bright lights turn on and off up there. They did this as if turning on a light switch. After three or four flickers, they just disappeared. They weren’t there anymore. When they flickered, they were slightly different placement. As if they moved left to right. It looked like maybe 3 inches in the sky. But being as far away as they were, this represented many miles.

On the third occasion I was in South Carolina. And again I was looking towards the sky. Just sitting there on a chair, sipping a glass of wine. Looking, as i sometimes do. But not in any way feeling the effects of alcohol. Right up near the big dipper. I saw one light up there. It turned on and then off. This happened possibly four times. There was maybe three or four minutes between flashes. And they did not move from their placement. Just looking like stars but turning on and off. And then nothing for the rest of my time out there. On this third occasion, I was not sure what I have seen. Could’ve been the space station. Or maybe a satellite. But I found the placement interesting. Right next to the big dipper. This third occasion could’ve been many things. But the first and second incident I was certain at what I had seen. Initially I felt that I had seen ‘Them’. But as time moved along, I decided that it might have been our craft. I imagine that their craft are much more advanced than what we have. But I believe that we have some tremendous technology that the public does not directly know about.  Ben Rich, who ran skunk works, made a Lecture that spoke of us having amazing technology. He said that not only could we now get out of our own solar system into the stars, but that we could now take ET home. 

This is not a comment on whether or not they are a potential danger. Or if they are just observing us. Possibly a little of both. I suppose this would depend on what race of beings we are talking about, and what intention they have. I’m sure duality exists throughout this plane of physical dimension. I’ve heard that Samarian text talks about us being genetically engineered, and I do not doubt this. After all, there is no missing link to the human race. And we are puttering around with Genetic technology ourselves. Think ‘Cloning’ or C.R.S.P R. technology. (I’m Forgetting the abbreviation here) Seeing these things should not be a shock to our system. Whether or not the planetary leaders should tell us through disclosure, or not, is nothing that I would comment on. I don’t know the particulars of our situation. But I imagine they do. At least somewhat. Have we made deals with some of them ?    I would say so. But I would not judge them for this as “what choice did they have“? After all, they are so much more advanced than we are, we really couldn’t fight them. We would have to join them. Naturally, it’s troubling simply because we don’t know whether or not they are being trustworthy with us. The way I feel about black budget.

If you start looking you may also see some of the unexplainable.",[],,0,,False,True,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve Seen 3 Strange Things In The Sky Over A 30 Year Period Of Time. 
The first one happened 30 years ago. And it was the best and most certain sighting of all. I was with a friend of mine who is an engineer. We were in a bird sanctuary in Massachusetts. There were no lights anywhere in the sky for 5 square miles. Only three houses were on this land because they were grandfathered in. All we saw was starlight. We saw two points of light in the sky appear. At first I thought they were meteors or asteroid’s.  Shooting stars. But as they traveled the horizon we noticed that they were perfectly in sync with each other, and there was no arcing to them. Nor was there a trail of debris behind them. They moved across the sky in a straight line for approximately 10 seconds. At first, I joked that they were shooting stars, and because they’re were two of them we would get two wishes apiece. But as they moved strangely forward, I mentioned how strange it was. He commented that it certainly was weird. After approximately 10 seconds of moving in a straight line, they moved upward at a 90° angle. They did not stop, and they did not curve. And they did this at approximately three times the speed of what we initially saw. After about three more seconds, they pinged out into deep space as if turning off a light. Ping, they were gone. We both knew what we had seen. But because I have always had an awareness of these things, I was not surprised. And seemingly neither was he.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second time I was outside my house, and actually looking at the sky for something. 10 minutes later, I saw two bright lights turn on and off up there. They did this as if turning on a light switch. After three or four flickers, they just disappeared. They weren’t there anymore. When they flickered, they were slightly different placement. As if they moved left to right. It looked like maybe 3 inches in the sky. But being as far away as they were, this represented many miles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the third occasion I was in South Carolina. And again I was looking towards the sky. Just sitting there on a chair, sipping a glass of wine. Looking, as i sometimes do. But not in any way feeling the effects of alcohol. Right up near the big dipper. I saw one light up there. It turned on and then off. This happened possibly four times. There was maybe three or four minutes between flashes. And they did not move from their placement. Just looking like stars but turning on and off. And then nothing for the rest of my time out there. On this third occasion, I was not sure what I have seen. Could’ve been the space station. Or maybe a satellite. But I found the placement interesting. Right next to the big dipper. This third occasion could’ve been many things. But the first and second incident I was certain at what I had seen. Initially I felt that I had seen ‘Them’. But as time moved along, I decided that it might have been our craft. I imagine that their craft are much more advanced than what we have. But I believe that we have some tremendous technology that the public does not directly know about.  Ben Rich, who ran skunk works, made a Lecture that spoke of us having amazing technology. He said that not only could we now get out of our own solar system into the stars, but that we could now take ET home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a comment on whether or not they are a potential danger. Or if they are just observing us. Possibly a little of both. I suppose this would depend on what race of beings we are talking about, and what intention they have. I’m sure duality exists throughout this plane of physical dimension. I’ve heard that Samarian text talks about us being genetically engineered, and I do not doubt this. After all, there is no missing link to the human race. And we are puttering around with Genetic technology ourselves. Think ‘Cloning’ or C.R.S.P R. technology. (I’m Forgetting the abbreviation here) Seeing these things should not be a shock to our system. Whether or not the planetary leaders should tell us through disclosure, or not, is nothing that I would comment on. I don’t know the particulars of our situation. But I imagine they do. At least somewhat. Have we made deals with some of them ?    I would say so. But I would not judge them for this as “what choice did they have“? After all, they are so much more advanced than we are, we really couldn’t fight them. We would have to join them. Naturally, it’s troubling simply because we don’t know whether or not they are being trustworthy with us. The way I feel about black budget. Well, we certainly need to advance ourselves in order to protect against any untoward actions. Personally, I would like to see disclosure. I think that masses of people could handle it. And I would like a good deal of this advanced technology used for the good of the entire human race. I’m talking about zero point energy. Anti-Gravity technology.

I live in the upper south, so the drive out there took a full two days. I had to stop somewhere for the night, and found a good campsite in a wilderness area in far western Colorado (the environment out there is a desert shrubland, far from the front range that Colorado is known for). My first night was uneventful, and I continued on my drive to California the following day. The trip went so smoothly that I got done with the trail two days early. 

I stopped to camp at the same site on my return trip. Since I had an extra day, I decided to hike around and take advantage of the extra time. I walked probably eight miles away from my campsite/car, stupidly, without a map. I got a little lost - and by a little, I mean I got so turned around that the sun was setting by the time I found the trail again. I resigned myself to camping off the trail, and heading to my car in the morning.  I spent the remainder of the evening reading a book and observing the ant colonies nearby. As night set in, I fell asleep in my little-two person tent promptly. 

Here’s where the “gripped by fear” part came in. In the wee hours of the night, I woke up damn near paralyzed with fear. Seriously. I was utterly convinced something or someone was RIGHT outside of my tent door. Every fiber of my being was telling me to lie as still as possible, and I held my breath for what felt like hours. There was no wind that night, it was totally silent. I just sat for as long as I could, until gradually I built up enough courage to slowly lean forward and look out the screen window above my head. I didn’t see anything. I waited longer, unzipped the door, and peered out. Nothing. Still terrified, but now curious and wanting to justify going back to sleep, I carefully exited my tent and started looking around.

Behind where I set up my tent, there was a small hill maybe 40 yards away. On that hill, illuminated by very faint starlight, was a shadowy figure (animal or human I don’t know) lurched over behind a shrub. I could only see the faintest outline of it. I thought it was maybe a hog or a black bear (do they have black bears in Mesa County CO? I’m not sure). After staring at it and tentatively stepping forward a few feet, it fled. But it fled by…standing up bipedally and running away over the hill. I yelled and started chasing it (this is usually how I scare black bears on my property, don’t lecture me on proper bear etiquette), running up and over the hill as well. On the other side was a drop off to an ENORMOUS ravine, with no trace of the person/hog/bear/Bigfoot anywhere to be seen. I slept very lightly the rest of that night. 

The next morning I walked back there to look for tracks and couldn’t find any. Then again, the rocky soil wasn’t very conducive to footprints in the first place.

Though the resource cost can be astronomical if you use lower level gear or low job affinity for materials (e.g., instead of 3~5 anima crystals or maybe 13 job crests, you might see numbers like 600+ anima crystals or 180+ job crests).

----

On the Bahamut difficulty, if looking to get the item level part done faster (and have a cache of anima crystals to unlock some missions and level up your existing jobs), would say some of the following:

Sunken Shrine, Azure Memories: The Rebel side mission. Max out every dragon trial except for:

* Buff Duration

* Max MP &amp; MP Recovery

* Command Ability MP Cost. 

Use Mage and Ninja with the Flee command (Thief job tree). Switch to Ninja, use the job action on the right-side of the wheel for Utsusemi to survive 3 hits. Run by all the enemies, grab the card key, head to the final room, use Mage's Aeroga to knock enemies off the platforms. They can regain MP by holding the charge if need be. 

In video format, the time stamp should be around 1 hour and 29 minutes in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq2e7ceR7fE&amp;t=5346s

----

Then for a few pieces of high item level gear, defeating the malboro from Hallowed Massif's Stymied at mission level 371+ or ???'s The Warrior (the original final mission location).

The latter, using Sage with Chaosbringer (Cyclic Warrior job tree), making sure to select Fire before going in there. Then using Chaosbringer after the malboro spawns, then spamming an uncharged Fire on the malboro to break it. Soul burst, pickup the loot. Die or abandon the mission. Optimize gear. Repeat until your average item level is 371+.

Then use the smithy to change and upgrade that gear, even if it's not artifacts or the ideal job affinities you wanted. Prioritizing main stats over percentage-based stats until you can't get any more of the main stat you're seeking. (e.g., a gun job using Starlight will want Intellect. If they didn't care about defense, they might go even further with things like Magic Damage Dealt or Holy Damage Dealt, etc. after Intellect is on every piece of gear.)

-----

An alternative and the safer route is finding an isolated stunlockable elite like malboro in the Stymied. Running past everything, Ninja still there for the Utsusemi, then using a job like Berserker (preferably the purple Berserker - Raider), to go Berserk, and swing at the malboro at the end for a couple minutes. Or Marksman with Marksman 400% job affinity (buy 8 limit releases from the Dragon Exchange and spend anima crystals to level the job up), slot Starlight on the 1st aiming link to recover MP based on magic damage dealt.

On this mission, consider leaving the following Dragon Trials off: Buff Duration, Max MP &amp; MP Recovery, Break Damage Dealt, Command Ability MP Cost, Enemy Stats, and Negate All Armor Effects. All the others can be left on and maxed out. Run past all the enemies, grab the key to the final room, hold normal attack to start aiming, lock onto the malboro, and hold your job action / combo ability button to Starlight the enemy until they're ready to break. Consider looking away from the screen to avoid the flashing and listen out for the noise that let's you know it's time to break the enemy.

In video format: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq2e7ceR7fE&amp;t=5780s around the 1 hour, 36 minute mark. Repeat the mission until the average item level is 371+.

They say low wages are reality
If we want to compete abroad
My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf
Come sit down on my knees
You are dearer to me than myself
As you yourself can see
While I'm listenin' to the steel rails hum
Got both eyes tight shut
Just sitting here tryin' to keep the hunger from
Creeping its way into my gut
Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues
Well, I'm sailin' on back, ready for the long haul
Tossed by the winds and the seas
I'll drag 'em all down to hell and I'll stand 'em at the wall
I'll sell 'em to their enemies
I'm tryin' to feed my soul with thought
Gonna sleep off the rest of the day
Sometimes no one wants what we've got
Sometimes you can't give it away
Now the place is ringed with countless foes
Some of them may be deaf and dumb
No man, no woman knows
The hour that sorrow will come
In the dark I hear the night birds call
I can hear a lover's breath
I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall
Sleep is like a temporary death
Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues
Well, they burned my barn and they stole my horse
I can't save a dime
I got to be careful, I don't want to be forced
Into a life of continual crime
I can see for myself that the sun is sinking
How I wish you were here to see
Tell me now, am I wrong in thinking
That you have forgotten me?
Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret
They waste your nights and days
Them I will forget
But you I'll remember always
Old memories of you to me have clung
You've wounded me with words
Gonna have to straighten out your tongue
It's all true, everything you have heard
Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
Sing a little bit of these workingman blues
In you, my friend, I find no blame
Wanna look in my eyes, please do
No one can ever claim
That I took up arms against you
All across the peaceful sacred fields
They will lay you low
They'll break your horns and slash you with steel
I say it so it must be so
Now I'm down on my luck and I'm black and blue
Gonna give you another chance
I'm all alone, I'm expecting you
To lead me off in a cheerful dance
I got a brand new suit and a brand new wife
I can live on rice and beans
Some people never worked a day in their life
Don't know what work even means
Well, meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s an evenin&amp;#39; haze settlin&amp;#39; over the town
Starlight by the edge of the creek

Winry, Hawkry, and Rory, still on the train

Smoke

The town is on fire

We still don't know who this mask guy is. This is now like the third or fourth time we've seen him.

Colonel Herschel

Well, there it is

The Black Bats are having their way with everyone 

Edward asks the guards if there's anymore underground chambers

The guards taunt him by basically saying ""Wouldn't you like to know, loverboy?""

But it was a distraction for Al to free them

Edward turned himself into a pipe. Funniest shit I've ever seen.

Telling Soyuz they're coming to whoop his behind

But Soyuz also has the Black Bats to worry about 

Edward and Alward, on the run

Ooh, Julia a Black Bat [](#awe)

Edward telling her this is all a big trap

Julia responds by telling her to leave saying they will proceed forward foe the sake of their future 

She is the night 

Well, so far they're doing good 

Gonna hide underground after paralyzing Soyuz's troops, Soyuz finds out

It appears they must escape

The tower

The Star of Blood is seemingly there

Whelp, Soyuz's second-in-command is dead

The Black Bats are in the tower now

Also, Ashley is a Black Bat now as well

The voice pipe to relay orders

That's the thing Edward turned himself into, which as established was the funniest thing 

It hosts the secret of the Sacred Land

HOLY SHIT

ASHLEY JUST STABBED MIRANDA WHAT THE FUCK

I legitimately just shouted holy shit for my entire house to hear

Julia being held back

Ashley is making Miranda's blood go through thr voice pipe 

So much for Miranda having rights

Ashley says there isn't a single drop of blood that isn't useful 

This is a three-dimensional Transmutation Circle drawn with blood of living humans 

Honestly, this isn't Edward's idealism being proven right. Ashley's just an asshole.

Now Ashley is being called First Lieutenant Atlas

Sergeant Raul

And he gets stabbed as well 

Taking no prisoners

Ashley requires more blood for the blood orgy

Oh man. He's walking over to Julia...

He wouldn't... would he?

It turns out this isn't Julia's brother after all

He's the one who killed Julia's parents 

They both have the torso tattoos

He ripped off her brother's skin and placed the map on himself 

He killed her brother 

And now he's putting the ripped brother skin he has onto Julia

Dude...

Shiny thing that looks like something out of Revue Starlight 

People are falling 

MIRANDA

SHE STABBED ATLAS

And he proceeds to stab her one final time, officially killing her

Shame. Ahead was the most interesting new character in the movie. 

EDWARD WITH THE PUNCH

LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO [](#SPORTS)

Blood pouring out

Bells ringing 

The Star has been forged, he says

Guiding Julia down, Edward and Al are 

Herschel says a new era shall begin 

I predict that Herschel is Ashley this whole time

A bunch of explosions

The tower just got destroyed 

And now lava is flowing everywhere 

Julia saying this wasn't a part of the deal, brother

Al says he's going to block the Magma 

Atlas going to see his Star of Blood giddy like a kid on Christmas morning 

Edward tries to prevent it, but Atlas manages to get it

Some more amazing action, this time between Edward and Atlas

Julia now has the Star of Blood

False advertising, it's neither a star nor red viscous fluid

Edward telling her to throw it into the Magma 

But she wants to save the valley

Edward is trying to tell her that the Star will devour her soul

But too late. She eats it.

Atlas trying to get the Star back

But she's just as powerful now

This is giving me Star Wars vibes

She says if this place didn't exist, her parents wouldn't have perished 

Herschel removing his little contraption from him

It's time for him to get involved 

Al blocking the Magma with a wall

He hopes it holds up

Roy wondering what Soyuz is doing 

His best, okay?

Edward and Julia 

Julia now kinda looks like Gamo-chsn from Nagatoro

Edward tells Roy that the Table City has fulfilled its purpose of creating a Philosopher's Stone 

Soyuz trying to sniper Edward 

But he gets noticed 

Roy orders his arrest

As this is going on, however, Julia seemingly has other plans

Julia is going to stop the Magma!

Winry

Gotta repair Edward's arm, and fast 

She only has tool for adjustment and not replacement, though 

And now Edward is flying with Winry on his back!

Okay, that's cool

Roy is going as well 

The town evacuating 

He asks Gon to fix his arm

He seems to recognize Winry

Al still trying to hold things up 

Julia

Nah, Al, I'd say she swallowed the Star of Blood given the glowing red eyes

Atlas trying to cause more trouble 

But Herschel intercepts!

Ashley Crichton 

Yep, called it

That's why he's wearing the mask

He survived using the Star of Blood his parents hid for their research 

""You can apologize to my parents in the underworld!""

Bit harsh to imply his parents are in hell 

Dude... he crushed his head

He popped his head like a pimple

Julia asks Ashley why didn't he let her know he was alive 

It was so he could kill the man who murdered his parents 

The wolf-chimeras were actually meant to protect them

Weird way of protecting them. That's like a tsundere showing their love by punching their crush in the face.

Last tsundere reference of the rewatch [](#sadholo)

Ashley asks Julia to come with him to Cleta, but Cleta says that isn't her home

Ashley points out that the people of this valley called their parents traitors 

""This valley has no future.""

Julia wants to create one, however, with blackjack and hookers 

Ashley scolds her for wasting her time

He's going to send an army to bury this valley

He's going to make the Sacred Land his

So much for him being a good guy 

Edward and Royward, walking like a couple of badasses

Edward says the ruins of Milos have been destroyed 

Ashley seems pleased with this development 

He'll simply rebuild the Star's Transmutation Circle, he says

It's crazy to think that this rewatch has been going on for almost 4 months now and u/Star4ace had a Transmutation Circle this entire time 

He's going to use the Star to open the Gate of Truth 

Ashley, that is, not Star4ace 

Says the Truth is the only object of value 

Edward says the Star he swallowed has consumed his soul

""Become yourself again!""

How about no?

The Magma 

Ashley doesn't seem to care about killing his sister

The Magma flowing into the water

Water in the fire WHY?!? WHY WATER IN THE FIRE?!? I don't understand. 

Ashley pleading Ashley to go with him

""A mountain of trash it may be, but the world isn't ugly.""

She's telling her brother her grain tastes delightful while his grain tastes very frightful 

Ashley condemns Ashley for being no different from everyone else

SHE'S BLOCKING THE MAGMA!

Edward and Al trying to help her

""Julia, if you can't understand how I feel... then you can go down with this valley!""

Julia using her power to grow a hand made of Magma",[],,0,,False,False,[],True,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winry, Hawkry, and Rory, still on the train&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smoke&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town is on fire&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still don&amp;#39;t know who this mask guy is. This is now like the third or fourth time we&amp;#39;ve seen him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gotta repair Edward&amp;#39;s arm, and fast &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She only has tool for adjustment and not replacement, though &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now Edward is flying with Winry on his back!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, that&amp;#39;s cool&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roy is going as well &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town evacuating &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He asks Gon to fix his arm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He seems to recognize Winry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Al still trying to hold things up &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nah, Al, I&amp;#39;d say she swallowed the Star of Blood given the glowing red eyes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atlas trying to cause more trouble &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Herschel intercepts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley Crichton &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep, called it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why he&amp;#39;s wearing the mask&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He survived using the Star of Blood his parents hid for their research &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You can apologize to my parents in the underworld!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bit harsh to imply his parents are in hell &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dude... he crushed his head&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He popped his head like a pimple&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia asks Ashley why didn&amp;#39;t he let her know he was alive &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was so he could kill the man who murdered his parents &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wolf-chimeras were actually meant to protect them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weird way of protecting them. That&amp;#39;s like a tsundere showing their love by punching their crush in the face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last tsundere reference of the rewatch &lt;a href=""#sadholo""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley asks Julia to come with him to Cleta, but Cleta says that isn&amp;#39;t her home&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley points out that the people of this valley called their parents traitors &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This valley has no future.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia wants to create one, however, with blackjack and hookers &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley scolds her for wasting her time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s going to send an army to bury this valley&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s going to make the Sacred Land his&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much for him being a good guy &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward and Royward, walking like a couple of badasses&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward says the ruins of Milos have been destroyed &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley seems pleased with this development &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;ll simply rebuild the Star&amp;#39;s Transmutation Circle, he says&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s crazy to think that this rewatch has been going on for almost 4 months now and &lt;a href=""/u/Star4ace""&gt;u/Star4ace&lt;/a&gt; had a Transmutation Circle this entire time &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s going to use the Star to open the Gate of Truth &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley, that is, not Star4ace &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Says the Truth is the only object of value &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward says the Star he swallowed has consumed his soul&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Become yourself again!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about no?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Magma &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley doesn&amp;#39;t seem to care about killing his sister&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Magma flowing into the water&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water in the fire WHY?!? WHY WATER IN THE FIRE?!? I don&amp;#39;t understand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley pleading Ashley to go with him&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A mountain of trash it may be, but the world isn&amp;#39;t ugly.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s telling her brother her grain tastes delightful while his grain tastes very frightful &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ashley condemns Ashley for being no different from everyone else&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHE&amp;#39;S BLOCKING THE MAGMA!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edward and Al trying to help her&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Julia, if you can&amp;#39;t understand how I feel... then you can go down with this valley!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julia using her power to grow a hand made of Magma&lt;/p&gt;

Smth that I should mention to you is that all of the Persona games are different storylines and have different characters that aren’t related to one another whatsoever, apart from the fact that they all reside in Japan.

Even so, I think that you should start your wonderful Persona phase by playing the first game, Persona 3! You might be wondering why it’s 3 and not smth like Persona 1 or simply just Persona, but that’s bc everyone usually just ignores and pretends it doesn’t exist. That’s bc they believe that Atlus, the company that owns the Persona/Shin Megami Tensei franchise, doesn’t actually care abt its first two games.

Anyways, yes, definitely would suggest playing Persona 3. I’d say the order you should play them in would be (1 being the first):

1.	⁠Persona 3 FES
2.	⁠Persona 3 Portable (play the female main character route, it’s different from the male’s)
3.	⁠Persona 3: Dancing In Moonlight (optional if you don’t want to play a rhythm dancing game)

&lt;p&gt;The top: private love, charm 16 but no x palette. The bottom: fond memories, the 6* bottom from the last season of endorsement queen, charm 16 and x palette unlocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A real test of the original question may be if anyone has both the endorsement queen outfit and rosy dream fully unlocked, as they are both 6* sexy, with the latter being a dress. I have both but I doubt I have enough trend tickets or whatever they&amp;#39;re called to fully unlock all of it to get it to the same level as the top/bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a long-time gaulish polytheist and folk practitioner and I was born with a rare disease that left me disabled for life and with extreme amounts of daily chronic pain. Because of my specific circumstances, it led me to a bit of a different path through my faith precisely because pain was and is such a big part of my life. So as a result, I chose and was chosen by two patron gods and one of them is specifically a healer.

I speak for you the name of Damona, Moon-goddess, lady of Serpents, Wells and Springs, Goddess of Healing. May she watch over you and guide your path.

I'm French and I'm from an area that was very important to the Gauls so there are quite a few remnents, inscriptions and carvings I've been able to witness. In my community, Damona is seen primarily as the protector of springs and sources, in particular thermal waters, and because thermal waters and hot springs are seen as sources of healing, she is worshiped and honoured as a healer-goddess. She's also very tied to the moon, another symbol of healing, and serpents which are a symbol of the oath of Hippocrate (the oath of doctors). She's also tied to wells, which just follows the water theme. And finally, tied to cows, who also have symbolism around the moon (the cow horns and moon in the middle form the three-moon symbol for ex) but also abundance and healing, depending on the communities and beliefs.

I'll share some of my practice with Damona and what my process is around dealing with my pain in relation to my faith.

First, I have a daily prayer for Damona. It's in French, since it's my native language and because France is modern-day Gaul so I view it as more appropriate to speak to the Gaulish gods in French no matter what. If you don't feel confident in speaking the French words phonetically, I also added a rough translation but it looses the poem-like structure and sound of the original prayer.

Ô, Damona, ma Dame des Sources

Offre-nous ta clareté guérisseuse

Qu'en ton sein, plus personne ne souffre

Ma Dame des Puits, sois notre bienfaiteuse

O, Damona, my lady of Sources

Gift to us your bright, healing wisdom

That within your breast/heart, we suffer no more

My Lady of Wells, be our blessed protector

I say the prayer every morning when I wake up and whenever I see the moon, be it at night or when it's visible during the day. 

The bulk of my worship is done at the altar, except during full moons which I dedicate to her, where I try to do some of the worship outside under the moonlight. A lot of ritual tools are tied to water, so moon water for ex, blessed water of any kind, offerings of drinks (wine and hot tea in particular: wine is/was a common offering for the gods and in France we have a huge wine culture and incredible wines to use as offerings / hot tea because it recalls the idea of hot springs/thermal waters and I use herbal medicine that treats pain as a call-back to my pain).

I have a sort of mantra when I'm in a lot of pain of just speaking her name until it becomes a sort of droning sound and I can kind of meditate into a state where the pain is easier to deal with. I ask her to bless my stores of herbal medicine for pain relief and I also ask her to bless my boxes of medication to increase their pain relieving qualities.

On my deity altar, she has a full-body portrait I made of her because it helps me focus to look at her instead of thinking about the pain.

Damona is essential to my practice as a gaulish polytheist and a folk practitioner, she's also the patron god of my herbal medicine service to my community (I help people for free with herbal healing and witchcraft). She helps me a lot with the pain, just thinking of her and praying to her are good ways to distract from the pain and doing worship rituals completely focused and dedicated to her to ask her for healing, pain relief or guidance during a medical appointment has been a great help. She has all my dedication. I really hate how people say they ""work"" with gods. No you don't, they're gods. You don't work with gods. You worship them. And in return, they protect and guide you, just like they've been doing since the time of the Gauls.

If you want to know more about different ways to honour Damona, I suggest the book Ancient Fire by Segomâros Widugeni. 

Other gods that have been tied to similar symbols are Borvo, who was also a god of rivers and streams, or Sirona who is sometimes confused with Damona but is closer to a starlight deity. I don't recognise Sirona, just because she isn't present in my area of France, but I do worship Borvo.

If you have questions or want to talk more, feel free to DM me. I hope this helps and I wish you the best for your pain.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a long-time gaulish polytheist and folk practitioner and I was born with a rare disease that left me disabled for life and with extreme amounts of daily chronic pain. Because of my specific circumstances, it led me to a bit of a different path through my faith precisely because pain was and is such a big part of my life. So as a result, I chose and was chosen by two patron gods and one of them is specifically a healer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;as for weapons, Terra Blade is a weapon that relies a fair bit on Melee Speed to be the most effective, and with your Beetle Shell set, it doesn&amp;#39;t compliment it much, it&amp;#39;s still very much viable and can carry you to Moon Lord with the help of your friend, but i&amp;#39;d recommend using a different weapon for combat whenever you get your hands on something like Influx Waver (not for Moon Lord though), Flying Dragon or Daybreak&lt;br/&gt;

The best way I can sum up my feelings about this show is...if you don't already think, *before* watching it for the first time, that you'll watch it a second time, don't watch it the first time.

2. I got it, it just sucked.  I didn't fully appreciate Revue Starlight on my first watch, but it was at least *good*.  It just moved onto my favorites list after a second watch.

3. Sadly, probably the first episode?  At least one of the first three or four.  Five is where it all goes wrong.  Favorite moment is the OP.

4. Closest thing I can think of that I actually enjoyed might be the Zero Escape series.  Or perhaps the Ender's Game books.

5. I will never be able to remember something like this, sorry.

6. Definitely not.

I'm gonna get down voted like crazy for my first opinion but I'm really not a fan of Haruka and Michiru or Neptune as a character really.

BEFORE YOU GET THE PITCHFORKS- I am a lesbian myself and I love a good wlw relationship and I still have a soft spot for Haruka. But I always felt like there wasn't much depth to the relationship and especially with Michiru it felt like so much of her character was dependent on Haruka and she never interested me much on her own. She always just felt flat and like there wasn't a lot of depth into her.

My favorite ship for Haruka is very much a crack ship but the ship just never really interested me because it felt very surface level and I prefer ships where they challenge each other and there's depth.

I also really dislike Yaten and Minako. Yaten is probably one of my all time favorite fictional characters and it bothers me with all the starlight ships but especially this one where a lot of people paint the starlights as being men who dress up as girls when the anime states it's a disguise. But some people view it as trans representation so you do you. But what bugs me is when people basically use it and treat Yaten and the other starlights as these doting loving romantic men and ignore every other aspect of their personality.

It drives me crazy because I adore the starlights and the way they clearly struggle with mental health issues and ptsd and the way they're not perfect heroes and some of their actions could even be considered as morally grey the way they're so hyper focused on their princess because without her they feel like their lives are pointless that they don't care about saving humans. It adds depth because they're warriors who were made to think their sole purpose is protecting their princess and without her Taiki is even willing to die as a ""sacrifice"" essentially because she doesn't see any value to living anymore as they essentially have no purpose.

What bothers me about Yaten/Minako is Yaten clearly doesn't reciprocate and it goes beyond tsundere. Yaten is rude and sassy and has very little patience and almost pushes Minako against the wall yelling in her face in one episode. The feelings are clearly not mutual but I'd like to think the two come to an understanding and develop a deeper friendship as a result but I just can't get behind shipping them. Especially when people ignore the sassy elements of Yaten's character and turn her into a generic male love interest who would bend over backwards for a girl when that is the opposite of her character.

My favorite ship is Seiya and Yaten because of the bickering they share and the way there's clear tension at times that could be read into as jealousy on Yaten's end. I just love love them and they have some small but sweet moments and I would have loved to see them be canon but know it will never happen. They don't have a lot of interactions but they're easily the best dynamic of that trio and their moments are gold and it's such an underrated ship.

At the end of the day I don't really care about who people ship but I also just wish some people would portray the characters for who they are rather then trying to force them into a box. If you're going to ship Yaten and Minako take advantage of Yaten's character, write some bickering. Write a story where Yaten is vain and obsessed with her appearance. Write about Yaten letting her walls down and being emotionally vulnerable. I'm pretty sure Yaten is also an empath so there's so much material there as well. But I hate seeing my favorite characters getting shoved into a box when they're so underrated and deserve way more love and appreciation.

We stand tall, never gonna crawl,
Against the wind, we brawl, we ball,
Rise above, we’re destined to rule it all.

Lights, camera, action, it’s my stage now,
Breaking barriers, making marks, showing 'em how,
No silver spoon, just a dream and a vow,
From whispers to roars, I bring the wow.

Every scar, every bruise, tells my tale,
In the storm of life, I set my sail,
Through highs and lows, I never derail,
In the book of legends, my name they'll hail.

My voice echoes, in every corner, every sound,
For every dreamer, believer, bound,

Through the silence, my voice spread,

When I started undergrad 4 years ago I had basically the same outlook As you. Ultimately I decided not to go for the masters as I was able to get the job I wanted at the company I wanted without it. 

But I think my general advice is still valuable.

Ultmently an ABET accredited degree is an ABET accredited degree. Paying for school prestige for undergrad just is not that valuable for engineers arguably even at the level of a MIT or Stanford it does not make Mutch of a difference for hiring for admitting to masters programs it may make a bit more difference but probably not as Mutch as you would think. 

What you do need and can't get everywhere is solid project based clubs or lab work. And this is really a quality over quantity thing. Your going to do 3 tops more likely just 1 or 2 but that better get enough to get your resumay build up. There are a lot of schools with dozens of aerospace projects clubs that have done nothing in the 5-10 years they existed. Finding a school with a solid club or two that makes consistent progress is important. 

As for lab work in my experience a bit less preteges unvcity can be more valuable. For that somewhere like Penn it's likely they have enough grad students kicking around that any undergrad research amounts to washing bolts or doing meneal tasks assisting grad students. 

I ended up going to a smaller state school where there is a small lab where I was able to find a role as a lead mechanical designer on several starlight projects during undergrad.

It's also worth noting that even if you do make it where your hoping to 100k of debut burdin is not fun to deal with even if by salary you can. But what really sucks is getting a few semesters in and coming out without the degree or with a lesser degree and 50K in debut.

They include stuff like Rusted Muzzle which is basicaly Talisman Bundle but for bleed, Standard-duty Battery and Mid-winter Nightmare, which are pretty universal.

Later I would invest in cost economy (more starting cost, more gifts sold at shops, chance for free refreshes/upgrades, more cost from selling EGO) and higher rarity gifts appearing in shops. It will make getting more appropriate gifts for your comps and overall getting fusion gifts more consistant + more resources for upgrading gifts/refreshing shops/buying more universal gifts. Most of the time you'll want the gifts that are only accesible from fusion, they are very good with exceptions of charge and tremor ""ultimate gifts"". And without Seize the Opportunity your odds of encountering tier IV gifts are slim to none. Or just seeing tier III gifts more then once every 2 runs. 

Fame and Feats, The Spoils of War and most of the Perseverance are pretty expensive so skipping them for now might not be a bad idea, just get the one that makes so there is 20% chance of free upgrade on all of the gifts.

Then I would consider getting stuff that imporves your choices for starting gifts. Just to not go insane from rerolling for best gifts or both fusion materials. Of course investing in max speed or starting sin resources is not bad either.

Physical Training is a joke, you're probably not going to see the difference when you're getting your ass whooped and you don't want to get hit anyways.

Maybe I could make a case for +10% dmg but there are gifts that do pretty much that after and before upgrade, if not better.

I don't even use skill replacements and if you don't either, I don't see a point in lowering those prices early and I don't think I had to heal in a shop/rest stop once since the release of MD3 during my grind. Seems like a waste of cost if you have a healing EGO and/or Lithograph/Phlebotomy Bag.

Being frogs for most of the movie and their major love scenes really hurts the romance part.

Glad I’m not the only one. Lady and the Tramp animal love thing just isn’t as relatable. 

If we had even had just *one* more fully-fledged scene of them as humans in love - maybe a transition scene of them making their way out of the bayou to return to their human lives where they’re talking/flirting, stopping to take an impromptu dance in the starlight again - that would have been *amaaaaazing*. 

But all we really get is a couple brief words + kiss at their wedding, then a short montage put to a song at the end, with no more dialogue :(

It wasn't the only idea going through my mind. Just the only one I was able to focus on. I wanted to focus on *her*. To commit every part of her to memory. To try to immortalize her in my mind for the last time. The beeping of the monitor attached to her felt like a timer. Every *beep* was like the ticking of a clock, counting each of her last seconds. Sometimes, they were slower, and I worried that her time was running out. Sometimes, they were faster, and I worried that the clock was speeding towards her end. 

Sally looked at me. I had to force myself to look back. I knew it was her. The name tag on the door and the birthmark beneath her eye proved it to me beyond all doubt. But I couldn't believe it was her. Her skin was tired and pallid, hugging tight against her bones and making her look weary and exhausted. Her hair was thin and fragile like straw, and her lips were thin and cracked. This *wasn't* my sister. This was some fake perversion of her. My sister was always jubilant and full of life. She took care of herself with an almostt religious fervor because she'd been obsessed with her looks since we were children. She always had the latest shampoo from Korea to make her hair shine like starlight. She always had face cream to make sure her face was smooth and unblemished.  She did *not* look like a corpse waiting in its grave. She did *not* look so tired that she couldn't even speak. 

My sister was alive. My sister was strong and energetic and funny. My sister did *not* have cancer. And she was *not* about to die. 

""What with the face, lil bro?"" she asked. She wasn't looking at me. We weren't sure whether she could still see or not. Her eyes were glued to the ceiling because she didn't have the energy left to even look at me. And yet, somehow, she knew that my face had fallen. ""I'm going to a better place soon. I won't be suffering in this stupid little hospital anymore."" 

I winced. That wasn't what she was supposed to sound like, either. My sister spoke loud enough to let everyone know where she was, everywhere she went. I remember that I used to admonish her for it, but she would always laugh it off. Right now? Even her voice sounded brittle and tired. I wanted to say something. I wanted to let her know what I was feeling. The fear, the anxiety. The absolute *anger* at the circumstances of the world that would take such a wonderful person away from me. But I couldn't. The air in the room felt too tense, too fragile. It felt like anything I did would break the invisible balance and I would lose it all. 

""Oh, don't go silent on me now, kid,"" she said. That was her name for me since we were young. Since when she would look after me and show me so many new things. ""This ain't the end."" 

""But it is,"" I said, finally forcing the words out. ""When you're gone... what will I do?"" 

""You've been doing pretty well in college on your own, kid."" 

""Because I knew that you were waiting somewhere! If anything happened to me I knew that I could come to you for help! What am I going to do when you're gone?"" 

The tears were flowing again. They wet my face. I thought they had all dried up the couple hours after the nurse came to deliver us the news. Apparently, I was wrong. I cried for a few seconds, feeling bad that I was wasting what little time she had left on myself, when something touched my hand. 

It was hard to see through the tears, but I managed. Her deep green eyes were staring into my own. The rest of her body had withered away, eaten up by the cancer, but her eyes? They were still strong. There was still that unyielding resilience there that allowed her to stand up to my parents when they found out I had a boyfriend despite being a boy. There was the strength that allowed her to make the decision to move out and take me with her at only fourteen years old.

the txv makes the pressure differential happen. it's what backs up the liquid refrigerant and makes pressure. so in the act of squeezing, it concentrates heat, which then gets blown into your house. the liquid trailing off from that process now needs more heat before it can be used again. so it's routed outside your house, and a fan blows over it, blowing even cold winter air over it-- that's fine, cold winter air has lots of heat in it, shit tons of it. everything has heat in the universe all the way down to absolute zero. only then is there no heat. starlight alone from 40 light years away is still lots of heat, measurable energy.

anyways, that warms the liquid back up, but it will condense water from outside and that water will immediately freeze. in 15-20 minutes, the unit outside will be a solid mass of ice. the system works around this, it switches the refrigerant back to AC mode and briefly uses some heat in your house to thaw those lines outside. once they're thawwed, the fan kicks back on and the process repeats.

Snow can reflect light, It's why people wear snow goggles and the Eskimos used to use a piece of wood across their eyes with slits cut into them, as there is such a thing as ""snow blindness"" where it reflects the rays of the sun and can damage your eyes.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow\_goggles

Obviously NV are used at night and I guess a really bright light could work in the same way, reflected from the snow into the tube, so he's not completely wrong, just slightly off the right track. 

The most important thing for a good astronomy NV tube is low EBI, if he'd mentioned that, then it would have been correct, but all he mentions is clarity of the tube he uses, and tbh most tubes are not great when focussing at infinity, as you would if you used the NV unaided without a telescope in front of it.

As for tubes being toxic inside, well that's mostly correct, as there are chemicals inside them that you wouldn't want to breathe in.

The Gallium Arsenide for just one. 

[https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference\_id/1346076](https://hero.epa.gov/hero/index.cfm/reference/details/reference_id/1346076)

Also, he's not really incorrect about the moon either, it's the brightest light in the night sky (even if it is reflected sunlight)  and prolonged observation with a non-auto-gated tube could damage the tube, or leave shadowing/streaking etc, it's just the way he's phrased it that's incorrect, there's zero context to his wording, if he'd explained why its bad, then that would be different, but he hasn't. 

Also, in regard to the 100x starlight damaging the NV, well that could be partly correct if you hooked up the NV to a telescope and pointed it at a really bright star, it might leave streaking or worse on the tube's MCP. 

&amp;#x200B;

So in essence, the guy's not completely wrong, he's just phrased it all, in the wrong way, with very little context to how he's explained it. 

Of course, a Gen 3 with auto-gating would negate about 99% of what he stated could be an issue.

Without auto-gating, well that's a different matter. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've sort of seen this myself, had a Gen 2+ XR5 tube with auto-gating and upgraded my housing to a newer one and put in it a F9800P Gen 3 without auto-gating and tbh when I use my IR laser illuminator or flashlight etc, I certainly know it, in any recorded footage, the image view is almost completely washed out with the Gen 3, whereas the Gen 2+ with AG would have compensated and the image would look fine.

Galaxy rotation curves are what provided the impetus to consider dark matter, because galaxies behave as though there is more matter in them than what we can see in terms of starlight.

Dark matter is a possible explanation, MOND is another possible explanation. Both have attractive premises; dark matter suggests there is something that interacts with gravity, but not with light, while MOND suggests that acceleration is quantized. The big issue with MOND is that proponents haven't been able to predict anything. When something is observed that we haven't seen before, it usually doesn't fit MOND's models, so the models have to be adjusted to fit the data. These sorts of *ad hoc* fixes don't show that MOND is wrong, but it's why most physicists who have an opinion prefer dark matter.

In terms of the debate about proving a negative, we've done searches for dark matter, and we've even ruled out candidates. For instance, dark matter is probably not just black holes. However, we haven't made any ""direct"" detections of dark matter. This is an example, however, of an absence of evidence *not* being evidence of absence, yet. We expect dark matter to be difficult to detect, because gravity is overall fairly weak, and most of our tools for detection rely on the electromagnetic force. As we collect more data, the chances of not making a direct detection are smaller and smaller, so if we still don't make a direct detection it will eventually rule out current models.

You’re engaged, and he’s on his bachelors trip. Speaking from my own experience, he might just feel secure enough in the relationship to not have to stay in constant contact when away. That’s not a bad thing. 

When I’d have to be away for weeks at a time working, my boyfriend would want to FaceTime every morning and every night and text multiple times throughout the day while I was working 12 hours each day with no days off for weeks on end. It was really exhausting and it took up any free time I had to actually relax. My time instead was spent trying to walk around in the pitch black in a remote area with tons of bears trying to get a signal from the stupid starlight internet to call him. It sucked and it made me feel resentful because I had zero down time. When I tried to communicate how it was affecting me, he took it personally and then I felt I had to overextend myself even more because he just wasn’t understanding how exhausting it was to work that job all day, and have to spend every second of my free time contacting him. 

I think in his mind he got all worked up because of some of the stories about remote worksites, he became really anxious and put those anxieties onto me.

Can’t see anything. The service sucks. Internet sucks. And there’s tons of bears and wolves)

Footnotes:

# Image 1

^(12) 'Elwing’ means ‘star-spray’. In Tàrhama, that would be *Énuswos* /eːˈnuswos/

^(13) 'Simaril’ means something akin to “radiance of pure light”. In Tàrhama, ‘radiance’ and ‘light’ are the same word, *énugasha* /eːnuˈgaʃa/. I would translate ‘Silmaril’ as either *énugasha tabosh* /ˈt̪aboʃ/, “pure light” or *énugashane* /eːnugaˈʃane/, “great light”.

^(14) More properly, *E’arendilnu* /Eʔarenˈd̪ilnu/, but Tàrhama usually drops the GEN.INAL suffix. Had I stuck with “their head”, it would have been either the proper *khor* *änhaw* or *änhawkho*, which is the 3rd person nominative pronoun treated as a suffix. The same process happens in the name of the language, which consists of *tarha* ‘language’ and the ‘suffix’ *-ama* ‘we’, so ‘our language’.

^(15) ’Tarmenel’ means ‘high \[as in royal or noble\] ‘sky’. In Tàrhama, that would be *khál iyan* /ˈxaːl ˈijan/.

^(16) lit. “their boat used biting breath”

^(17) If the speaker is one of the sea-nomads of the southeast, they would use *te’adadind* /t̪eʔad̪aˈd̪ind̪/ “east” and *idutulshiri* /id̪uˈt̪ulʃiri/ “west” instead.

# Image 2

^(18) lit. “the black waves caused, they were carried back through Evernight”

^(19) lit. “distances”. The units the séräng use for distances/length are based on the body and range of vision. Anything beyond the distance they could run in an hour, would just be ‘distant’, hence *jeygasha*.

^(20) If the speaker is one of the sea-nomads of the southeast, they would use *te’aydu* \[t̪eˈʔai̯d̪u\] instead. If they are from the mountain-dwellers of the east, the people living underground in caves, or from the dragon-worshippers of the northeast, they would use *te’adáhabe* \[t̪eʔad̪aːˈhabe\].

^(21) If the speaker is from the southern jungles, they would use *énu te’a*, lit. “water gem” instead. If they belong to any of the eastern peoples, they would use *äkhlu* ‘heart’ (in the third noun class, connected with water) instead.

^(22) Literally “sun metal”.

^(23) *ubwe-* encompasses the colours of everything that grows, so green, yellow, and brown. A more fiery yellow would be *has-*.

^(24) 'Valinor’ translates to ‘land of the Valar’. Using the term *Àkhiray* /ˈaxirai̯/ (the Great Spirits in service of the supreme god Udan) instead of Valar, that would be *Akhiraynähn* /axiˈrai̯næhn/.

^(25) Referring specifically to physical beauty and literally meaning ‘it (Elvenhome) stands in beauty’. Inner beauty would be *äkhluhwen* /æxˈluʍen/.

^(26) lit. “where they echo glass in regards to clearness”

^(27) Ilmarin means ‘mansion of high airs’. According to Eldamo, it probably derives from *ilma* ‘Starlight’ and is related to *Ilmen* ‘Place of (Star)light’. In Quenya, the dwelling of Manwë and Varda is called *Oromardi* ‘lofty halls’ and that’s what I’m going with. In my translation of *Namarië* I translated that as *gashtul khálushosh* /ˈgaʃt̪ul xaːˈluʃoʃ/

^(28) If the speaker is one of the eastern peoples, they would use *onhawi* /onˈhawi/ instead

^(29) Tirion translates to ‘watch-tower, tower’, which is more or less what *khálushangi* means. It consists of *khálush* meaning ‘high’ and *angi* ‘watch, see’ (literally ‘eye’).

^(30) lit. “the torches cause, they \[the towers\] are lit”

^(31) lit. “they are echoed”

# Image 3

^(32) Meaning “knowledgeable people”, lit. “knowledge-full”

^(33) More accurately, “miracle, wonder”, lit. “holy happening”

^(34) lit. “they caused, Eärendil donned elven-white”

^(35) Derived from *Calaciryandë*, of which *-andë* is a toponymic suffix. So *Kalakiryanähn* with *-nähn* being a suffix meaning ‘land of’. *Calcirya* itself means ‘pass/cleft of the light’, which would be *énugashatsulhu* /eːnugaʃa t͡sulhu/ in Tàrhama

^(36) lit. “they stood in sadness”

^(37) The different peoples have different words for year. Other words would be: oːhosja /oːhosja/ \[savanna and desert people\]; d͡ʒuguŋʷæd͡ʒu d͡ʒuguŋʷæd͡ʒu lit. “great cycle”; d͡ʒuguŋʷæja d͡ʒuguŋʷæja \[peoples of the east\]

^(38) lit. “these are forbidden for them, they (who) dwell in the world”",[],,0,,False,False,[],True,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/conlangs/comments/18bgvwt/first_three_stanzas_of_tolkiens_song_of_e%C3%A4rendil/""&gt;Following this post, in which I translated the first three stanzas.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In video format: https://youtu.be/FJjYo7h1Y1g 

This is primarily for the blessing % for 500~750 to get stats based on those percentages, even when the summon blessing is not selected as your primary blessing.

----

For smithy materials, use the Ancient Chaos Shrine: Wanderer with Mission Level+ 180 trials enabled. Defeat the metal cactuars, preferably the one on the left. If you miss the opening attack and they get out of range, reset their positions at the cubes instead of chasing one down. Ignore the second unless you have a surefire way to get both of them in one go (e.g., 10,000 Needles).

In video format using the Paladin's Holy Fang and Flee command for reference: https://youtu.be/XkONghFc1f8

But could also use Flee with Cactuar Needle's 1000 Needles. Or Gigantuar Needle's 10,000 Needles with some preparation. Void Knight 600% for the Haste may be preferable if you think you'll be here for more than a few minutes.

The manikin materials they drop do not show up on the UI during the mission. When you're at the smithy, these materials will get used to substitute anima crystals, job crests, rat tails, and other crafting materials once you run out of them (would recommend spending your anima crystals to unlock missions first and using any rat tails to fill out your preferred Evocation/Ultima class trees.)

The above will be sufficient to gear up and prep for the remaining DLC story missions. But to remember to turn off Dragon Trials before aiming to clear the story missions.

As a bonus, for gear effects, if you're just looking for some to get started, consider boss rushes, but turning the Mission Level+ trials down and trying to get trials around VI to IX for now. Roman numeral effects I to VIII will still be a leg up compared to using the regular smithy to change effects. Or in some slots, anything instead of nothing. 

BUT if your goal is to climb the Rift past achievements and story, then would say to use the Rift to keep an eye out for gear effects - maybe checking every 15~30 floors to see what you got.

The 12 Quillin were fighting Shrth, the 13th and most corrupted one of them all. For centuries they had fought on Earth, and used the humans in their armies to besiege Shrth's legions, (armies made up of his own creations and in his mind, the pure and correct versions of the creatures created by the the other 12 Quillin).  


It took all 12 Quillin to subdue Shrth, as his strength was greater than theirs individually, thus over the centuries, his strongholds fell and he was forced to flee to Antúílaqlith (The realm where no starlight shines), his last land which was still standing.  


The Quillar sieged Shrth and reduced his legions to almost nothing. However, this was all going according to his plan, as in Minhurlith and Amharlith, the two realms of the Quillar (Basically just an afterlife for humans, where humans were granted immortality), the souls were rallying to Shrth's side as for centuries, while the Quillin were on Earth, their realms were unguarded, and Shrth began to slowly corrupt the minds of the souls living there, and made them doubt the ability of the Quillin and side with Shrth.  


Thus Minhurlith erupted into civil war, with the uncorrupted people fighting the corrupted, in the end, the corrupted humans won and destroyed Minhurestauth, the chief city of Minhutlith.   


They then sailed to Amharlith and forced the people to join them in their conquest, and so they did.  


But when they returned to Earth, they appeared as corpses, rising from their grave, their  rotting flesh held together by Shrth's will, and nothing else.  


These legions lay siege to the Quillin who were sieging Shrth in Antúílaqlith, resulting in a double siege, in which the Quillin armies were massacred by the hordes on both sides.  


The 12 managed to escape only due to their immortality, but when they looked upon Minhurlith and Amharlith, they saw that the lands were emptied, and they realised what had happened, and that the soldiers who were attacking them were corrupted versions of the souls in their lands.  
They knew that they were defeated by the Dark Lord and took a lot of measures to ensure that Mihurlith and Amharlith could never be accessed by the living, not even the most powerful sorcerer could influence the realm after the Quillin had rebuilt it and fortified it.  


They took several centuries to recover from this defeat, and to replenish their population with departed souls from Earth, and all the while, Earth was under the thumb of Shrth.  
The humans who were loyal to the Quillin also lost faith in them, due to their 'cowardly' escape and leaving their creation of Earth defenseless against Shrth's hordes.  


So yeah, this was a huge event in the 1st War of Tilyarlith, and as an extension, the entire world, this shaped how the Quillin would act from now, how they would wage wars, govern their realms, and also how humans would view their creators for millenia, until the 2nd War of Tilyarlith, when they returned to liberate Earth.",[],,0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Emptying&lt;/p&gt;

Corporations hoarding homes thank Canadians for enthusiastically blaming immigration  
August 21, 2023 by Ian MacIntyre ( u/mrianmacintyre )

MARKHAM, ON – As housing unaffordability rages out of control, the loose coalition of corporate landlords, investment property flippers, Airbnb moguls, REITs, and foreign real estate money launderers held a brief press conference thanking Canadians for training their public outrage solely on immigration.  
“We understand that everyday Canadians are feeling squeezed by the cost of housing,” said William Jensen, spokesperson for Starlight Investments, Canada’s largest corporate landlord. “That is why we appreciate them not taking it out on us, the people absolutely responsible for the problem.”  
Jensen added, “You keep blaming people coming to this country for a better life, and we’ll keep making sure they will absolutely never afford it.”  
As message boards and Reddit threads fill with everyday Canadians citing increased immigration targets as the sole reason most Canadians cannot afford to buy or even rent a home, Jensen and his diverse coterie are quick to share credit. “We wish that this immigrant scapegoating was all our doing, but the truth is we’ve had a ton of help.”  
“Shoutout to the boys in Canada’s overwhelmingly Conservative media who consistently blame immigrants in order to shield our country’s investment class,” Jensen added, pointing toward the assembled crowd of reporters. “Speaking of the money men, big ups to the banks for decades of low interest rates that let us parlay owning some of Canada’s rental properties and starter homes, into owning most of them!”  
The group of profit-driven property hoarders were also eager to credit their good fortune to “The Big Three” — namely Prime Ministers Chretien, Harper, and Trudeau.  
“Special thanks to Jean for downloading housing onto the provinces, to Steve for letting prices skyrocket, and finally to Justin for realizing the problem was too big to solve and instead just tweeting about the Barbie movie,” Jensen added. “If not for these guys, folks might start blaming housing policy, instead of people who speak English as a second language.”  
Following the statement, several members of the corporate group expressed their thanks for Canadians’ blaming of unwitting immigrants.  
Jimmy Vanzik of Vancouver added, “If people stopped fixating on immigrants, they might notice how assholes like me own and operate dozens of Airbnbs that not only stay off the longterm rental market, but also create nuisances for neighbouring units. Thanks immigrants!”  
Doug Ford, of Etobicoke, Ontario noted, “I love immigrants. I can name 5 hard working immigrant families, and they were all at my daughter’s wedding telling me which Greenbelt land to rezone for them.”  
Meanwhile, Canadian citizens shared their opinions.  
Martin Graves of Victoria, BC notes, “I got renovicted from my apartment of 30 years by the landlord who said his nephew was moving in, and now I see him listing it for double the price. Pretty sneaky scheme by immigrants if you ask me.”  
Shelley Whilkins of Brampton, ON added, “Having this immigration policy to blame housing affordability on is also a handy means to launder my existing prejudices through. What a time saver!”  
“We’re not criticizing immigrants,” wrote Twitter user u/BonerPatrol420, “We’re criticizing immigration policy. For example, Trudeau’s immigration policy allows too many people into the country who all drive terribly and smell weird.”  
Back at the press conference, the event was cut short, as the offices where it was held will be bulldozed to build multiple single unit detached homes after being hastily rezoned, likely by immigrants.

Cursa is the second incarnation of the Megabug, an unnatural blight upon the Mario universe that came close to destroying it, and Cursa also wants to destroy everything **by draining the worlds of energy with Darkmess**, so she's got the scope for sure. Cursa's constant need for more energy and the power to drain it from living beings would make targetting the Crystal Heart or the magic of Equestria's population an easy reason for her to come to Equestria in the first place, ~~her energy draining powers allow her to not get murked by Discord off the bat,~~ her power to create minions by fusing Rabbid DNA with objects could make a diverse cast of soldiers from varying locales and turn a mystical item into a boss (maybe Cursa even raids a place storing magical treasures to make a new wave of Spark Hunters), and she's such a horrible boss that some of her minions or allies could be turned against her. 

Hell, looking at the two who did, Edge and Kanya, they'd fit very well into this. Edge is turning good on her own and would totally be buds with Rainbow Dash and her being the Element of Loyalty could convince Edge to reveal her past of her own volition because Rainbow would still stick by her even knowing how she used to be Cursa's right hand, and Pinkie Pie could teach her to have fun and be more than just a warrior. Kanya is a terrifying villain comparable to Cursa herself but only became so out of *anger* against her creator instead of her own vileness, the Mane 6 (and Starlight) could absolutely convince her to change. I can Twilight doing it just by appealing to Kanya's ego, *begging* for her help taking Cursa down, saying she's never seen technology like hers in Equestria before and they're going to FAIL without her. As time goes on and Kanya has positive relationships, actual *friends* who care about her, her talents are validated, and she's loved by the people. . . she just likes being good more than being evil.

I'd wager that Fluttershy might even be able to turn Daphne against Cursa in a shocking turn of events where her affinity with animals trumps Cursa's control over Daphne's mind to tame the most evil of Cursa's minions. And that fucking psychopath trying to hold back her savage instincts for her new friends and Edge would be an interesting dynamic, especially if there are times where Daphne's worst instincts get the better of her and she thinks she'll always be a monster because of it. Discord could help Daphne through that existential crisis, both because he's struggled with his chaotic nature being at odds with his friends too and because he's seen a monster worse than Daphne could ever be even if she tried: Cosmo. When the shit Cosmo did terrifies Daphne, Discord uses it to show her that she's not a monster. Even if she was raised in an environment devoid of morals and it's taking time to learn them, deep down she always had standards.

Cursa's Darkmess Dimension limiting everyone to only a single power would be very interesting in MLP. Both because it allows a weakened Discord to remain useful because EVERYONE has lost the vast majority of their magic, and because to succeed the Mane 6 and Starlight are going to have to rely on eachother. The best weapon they have in there truly is their friendship, they'll only get anything done in there as a team.",[],,0,,False,False,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Bowser vs Eggman Fan'}]",False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cursa (Mario + Rabbids)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cursa is the second incarnation of the Megabug, an unnatural blight upon the Mario universe that came close to destroying it, and Cursa also wants to destroy everything &lt;strong&gt;by draining the worlds of energy with Darkmess&lt;/strong&gt;, so she&amp;#39;s got the scope for sure. Cursa&amp;#39;s constant need for more energy and the power to drain it from living beings would make targetting the Crystal Heart or the magic of Equestria&amp;#39;s population an easy reason for her to come to Equestria in the first place, &lt;del&gt;her energy draining powers allow her to not get murked by Discord off the bat,&lt;/del&gt; her power to create minions by fusing Rabbid DNA with objects could make a diverse cast of soldiers from varying locales and turn a mystical item into a boss (maybe Cursa even raids a place storing magical treasures to make a new wave of Spark Hunters), and she&amp;#39;s such a horrible boss that some of her minions or allies could be turned against her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hell, looking at the two who did, Edge and Kanya, they&amp;#39;d fit very well into this. Edge is turning good on her own and would totally be buds with Rainbow Dash and her being the Element of Loyalty could convince Edge to reveal her past of her own volition because Rainbow would still stick by her even knowing how she used to be Cursa&amp;#39;s right hand, and Pinkie Pie could teach her to have fun and be more than just a warrior.

*Backstory*

I was born in a small village on the outskirts of Astrazalian, the City of Starlight, in the Feywild.  My mother, father and two uncles were historians and librarians, so I grew up in a very academic and studious environment.  I studied an amazing variety of subjects, but one stuck with me.  I picked up a book when I was about 13 and learned about the Crimson General, the female deity of battle tactics and strategy.  I was fascinated and couldn't get enough information about her.  After a couple years of nursing my passion, I left home, to my family's great dismay, and joined a band of Red Knight worshipers that was passing through town.  I swore an oath to Her and started my life as a warrior, battle commander, and acolyte of the Crimson General.  My compatriots and I get paid to take fighters, mercenaries and warriors, train them, and turn them into highly-cohesive effective combat units.

He wasn't an entity bound by time or space, nor was he confined to the physical existence. Epherion was a being of pure dreams, a whisper in the cosmic winds, a shadow in the realm of thoughts.

His domain was a labyrinthine bazaar, hidden within the collective dreamscape of a thousand slumbering souls. Here, dreams shimmered like mirages, each a vivid tapestry of hopes, fears, and fantasies. But unlike other merchants of dreams, Epherion never bartered with mere currency. His price? A quest through the boundless realms of dreams, a journey of self-discovery, of facing one's deepest fears and desires.

For those daring enough to seek him, the path was not simple. It required traversing through the dreams of others, a kaleidoscope of worlds within worlds, each more surreal and wondrous than the last. There were dreams as delicate as spider webs, glittering with morning dew, and nightmares as tumultuous as storms, thundering with unspeakable fears.

Epherion's abode was a palace of dreams, an ever-changing mirage that danced at the edge of consciousness. Its walls whispered secrets of ancient times, its halls echoed with the laughter and cries of countless dreamers. In this palace, reality and fantasy blurred, time looped in endless circles, and the impossible became possible.

Epherion himself was a figure of awe, cloaked in a nebula of stardust, his eyes galaxies of unspoken wisdom. He never dreamed, for he might have been a dream himself, an idea birthed from the collective subconscious of every dreaming being.

Those who found him were asked to live out a dream, not their own but one that Epherion chose. These dreams were epic sagas, where ordinary beings transformed into heroes, villains, sages, and fools. They battled dragons made of starlight, delved into oceans of liquid thoughts, and soared across skies painted with the auroras of imagination.

But why did Epherion do this? Some said it was for his amusement, others whispered it was a test, a way to teach the dreamers about themselves. The truth remained locked within Epherion's timeless gaze.

And so, like a rose that effortlessly spreads its scent, Epherion offered dreams to those who sought them. To gain a dream from the master was to embark on a journey not just through the dreamscape, but through one's soul. It was to touch the very essence of existence, to grasp the ungraspable, to understand that in this vast, mysterious universe, we are all but dreams dreaming dreams.

In the end, as dreamers awoke, they carried with them more than just echoes of fantastical adventures.

The rest of that series is:

* *The Parched Sea* by Troy Denning
* *Elfshadow* by Elaine Cunningham
* *Red Magic* by Jean Rabe
* *The Night Parade* by Scott Ciencin
* *The Ring of Winter* by James Lowder
* *Crypt of the Shadow King* by Mark Anthony

* *The Veiled Dragon* by Troy Denning
* *Silver Shadows* by Elaine Cunningham
* *Stormlight* by Ed Greenwood
* *Finder's Bane* by Jeff Grubb &amp; Kate Novak
* *Thornhold* by Elaine Cunningham

*Elfsong*, *Elfshadow*, *Silver Shadows*, and *Thornhold* are also the first four books in the ""Songs and Swords"" series by Cunningham. The last one is:

* *The Dream Spheres*

The two ""The Harpers"" books by Grubb and Novak, *Masquerades* and *Finder's Bane* are both sequels to the ""Finder's Stone"" series:

* *Azure Bonds*
* *The Wyvern's Spur*
* *Song of the Sauriels*

*Finder's Bane* itself is the first book in the ""The Lost Gods"" crossover series that also features installments set in other worlds than the Forgotten Realms. The other two books are:

* *Fistandantilus Reborn* by Douglas Niles
* *Tymora's Luck* by Jeff Grubb &amp; Kate Novak

*Fistandantilus Reborn* is the middle entry in the thematically-linked ""Lost Legends"" series of books set in the world of Dragonlance, the others being:

* *Vinas Solamnus* by J. Robert King
* *Tales of Uncle Trapspringer* by Dixie Lee McKeone

A wee bit sidetracked there, but finally, the big one! The ""The Sundering"" series installment *The Companion* is part of the ""Legend of Drizzt Do'Urdan"" by R.A. Salvatore, and this one's a doozy:

* *The Crystal Shard*
* *Streams of Silver*
* *The Halfling's Gem*
* *Homeland*
* *Exile*
* *Sojourn*
* *The Legacy*
* *Starless Night*
* *Siege of Darkness*
* *Passage to Dawn*
* *The Silent Blade*
* *The Spine of the World*
* *Servant of the Shard*
* *Sea of Swords*
* *The Thousand Orcs*
* *The Lone Drow*
* *The Two Swords*
* *The Orc King*
* *The Pirate King*
* *The Ghost King*
* *Gauntlgrym*
* *Neverwinter*
* *Charon's Claw*
* *The Last Threshold*

(*The Companions* goes here.)

* *Night of the Hunter*
* *Rise of the King*
* *Vengeance of the Iron Dwarf*
* *Archmage*
* *Maestro*
* *Hero*
* *Timeless*
* *Boundless*
* *Relentless*
* *Starlight Enclave*
* *Glacier's Edge*
* *Lolth's Warrior*

*Servant of the Shard* is also the first book in the ""Sellswords"" series by Salvatore, the rest being:

* *Promise of the Witch-King*
* *Road of the Patriarch*

Finally, the ""Cleric Quintet"" series by Salvatore started out as a separate thing, but many characters from it end up appearing in the ""Legend of Drizzt"" series later. These books are:

* *Canticle*
* *In Sylvan Shadows*
* *Night Masks*
* *The Fallen Fortress*
* *The Chaos Curse*

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Masquerades&lt;/em&gt; by Jeff Grubb &amp;amp; Kate Novak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Curse of the Shadowmage&lt;/em&gt; by Mark Anthony&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Veiled Dragon&lt;/em&gt; by Troy Denning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Silver Shadows&lt;/em&gt; by Elaine Cunningham&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stormlight&lt;/em&gt; by Ed Greenwood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finder&amp;#39;s Bane&lt;/em&gt; by Jeff Grubb &amp;amp; Kate Novak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thornhold&lt;/em&gt; by Elaine Cunningham&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elfsong&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Elfshadow&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Silver Shadows&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Thornhold&lt;/em&gt; are also the first four books in the &amp;quot;Songs and Swords&amp;quot; series by Cunningham. The last one is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dream Spheres&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two &amp;quot;The Harpers&amp;quot; books by Grubb and Novak, &lt;em&gt;Masquerades&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Finder&amp;#39;s Bane&lt;/em&gt; are both sequels to the &amp;quot;Finder&amp;#39;s Stone&amp;quot; series:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Azure Bonds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wyvern&amp;#39;s Spur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Song of the Sauriels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finder&amp;#39;s Bane&lt;/em&gt; itself is the first book in the &amp;quot;The Lost Gods&amp;quot; crossover series that also features installments set in other worlds than the Forgotten Realms. The other two books are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fistandantilus Reborn&lt;/em&gt; by Douglas Niles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tymora&amp;#39;s Luck&lt;/em&gt; by Jeff Grubb &amp;amp; Kate Novak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fistandantilus Reborn&lt;/em&gt; is the middle entry in the thematically-linked &amp;quot;Lost Legends&amp;quot; series of books set in the world of Dragonlance, the others being:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vinas Solamnus&lt;/em&gt; by J. Robert King&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tales of Uncle Trapspringer&lt;/em&gt; by Dixie Lee McKeone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wee bit sidetracked there, but finally, the big one! The &amp;quot;The Sundering&amp;quot; series installment &lt;em&gt;The Companion&lt;/em&gt; is part of the &amp;quot;Legend of Drizzt Do&amp;#39;Urdan&amp;quot; by R.A. Salvatore, and this one&amp;#39;s a doozy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Crystal Shard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Streams of Silver&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Halfling&amp;#39;s Gem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homeland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sojourn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legacy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starless Night&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Siege of Darkness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Passage to Dawn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Silent Blade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Spine of the World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Servant of the Shard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sea of Swords&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Thousand Orcs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lone Drow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Two Swords&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Orc King&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pirate King&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ghost King&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gauntlgrym&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neverwinter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charon&amp;#39;s Claw&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last Threshold&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;The Companions&lt;/em&gt; goes here.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Night of the Hunter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rise of the King&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vengeance of the Iron Dwarf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Archmage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maestro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Timeless&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boundless&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Relentless&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starlight Enclave&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glacier&amp;#39;s Edge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lolth&amp;#39;s Warrior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Servant of the Shard&lt;/em&gt; is also the first book in the &amp;quot;Sellswords&amp;quot; series by Salvatore, the rest being:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Promise of the Witch-King&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Road of the Patriarch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the &amp;quot;Cleric Quintet&amp;quot; series by Salvatore started out as a separate thing, but many characters from it end up appearing in the &amp;quot;Legend of Drizzt&amp;quot; series later. These books are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Canticle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Sylvan Shadows&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Night Masks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fallen Fortress&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chaos Curse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is... I think everything I can connect. I &lt;em&gt;did not&lt;/em&gt; anticipate the length of that thread when I began pulling on it. Honestly, at a certain point I just kept going to see if I could find the end more than anything else. After naming almost half the novels in the Forgotten Realms line, I think I&amp;#39;ve just about found it!&lt;/p&gt;

In my imagination, my imaginary show will appear on the same day.

Then on 11/9/2010, I’ll put in some characters as fandmade(Button Mash, Cream Heart, Elaina{Male}, Gibsen Shortcut, Shady Raze, Rumble, Thunderlane, Cloudchaser and Flitter, Strike, and Pinney Lane)

And on 1/7/2011, which will also be fan based with alternative scenes, I’ll make Diamond and Silver evil villains including their families in the others season. Why? Here’s an example. I’m still using Diamond Tiara as a villain from seasons 1-4. Imagine that she has a secret hide out under her house, and her family a robots as themselves. Also, imagine Silver Spoon’s parents that are in creepy robes, plus they should have robots as themselves too. So if they’re faking to be reformed, the mane 6 will turn them into stone too.

&lt;p&gt;List of Reform Villains: Trixie, Gilda, Discord, Ahuizotl, Garble plus his crew, Sunset, Starlight Glimmer, and Stygian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;List of Villains: Manny Roar, Shadowbolts, Diamond Tiara plus her parents and Sliverspoon, Flim and Flam, Chyrsalis, Sombra, Dust, Mane-iac, Suri, Tirek, Wind Rider, The Storm plus his army, Svengallop, Gladmare, Grogar, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my imagination, my imaginary show will appear on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then on 11/9/2010, I’ll put in some characters as fandmade(Button Mash, Cream Heart, Elaina{Male}, Gibsen Shortcut, Shady Raze, Rumble, Thunderlane, Cloudchaser and Flitter, Strike, and Pinney Lane)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on 1/7/2011, which will also be fan based with alternative scenes, I’ll make Diamond and Silver evil villains including their families in the others season. Why? Here’s an example. I’m still using Diamond Tiara as a villain from seasons 1-4. Imagine that she has a secret hide out under her house, and her family a robots as themselves. Also, imagine Silver Spoon’s parents that are in creepy robes, plus they should have robots as themselves too. So if they’re faking to be reformed, the mane 6 will turn them into stone too.&lt;/p&gt;

I think they should have better training not necessarily in just restraint but in effective ways to overcome resistance without substantial injury.  People freak out about chokeholds but I honestly feel like for a drugged up highly resistant person it's probably a better option than just beating the shit out of him.  Police should be better trained in grappling and submission techniques, it looks bad but you can forcefully detain a violent suspect with less chance of injury by either isolating the limbs effectively or choking them out of their capacity to resist. 

  But honestly I don't think there is any way officers can restrain a violent and resistive suspect without getting blasted on the internet.

Gacha games just work on luck and you have to accept the game is made that way especially when a 5star character is on standard banner, you have to assume you are never gonna get it. In Genshin its been 3 years and I haven't got Jean yet, got Keqing last month after almost 3 years, when I lost pity.  Don't have some weapons that I wish I could have but you got to make do with what you got.

Most HSR content can be completed using the free characters but still if you want to make it easy, we need to keep an eye on upcoming character banners and save premium currency because on limited banners at least we have a guarantee that after specific pulls (ie 160 pulls worth of jades/pass) you gonna get it. Trying to spend premium currency on something that has no guarantee is not the way to go with gacha games, it's a hard lesson for those who don't understand this.

In HSR, pulling for Silverwolf,Seele, DHIL, Kafka, Fu Xuan, Ruan Mei, etc These are some OP characters that will help you clear most of the content with ease, along with some 4star buffers that you can mostly get with previous banners so far like Pela, Asta, Tingyun, Gunafien.

We can easily clear most of the content.

Again, as I said it is easier to preach than to practice. Gacha games are just like that you can't expect to get something unless it's on limited banner.

After getting Seele, I have been just after Quantum Characters. So, I didn't pull on any other banners and got what I want with even 160 pulls if necessary.

* Seele after almost 160 pulls, lost pity to Bronya
* Silverwolf after almost 80 pulls.
* Fu Xuan after almost 160 pulls, lost pity to Gepard
* Ruan Mei after almost 80 pulls

I now have 11 tickets + 160 pulls worth jades (25943) + 46 Emergency Pulls from Starlight Exchange(this i am saving for LC's). Total 217 pulls. I think I am content.

My next pull is indeed Sparkle been waiting for Harmony Quantum character.  
But I might do few pulls on DHIL to get the new 4star if possible.  
After Quantum, I am thinking of going after Imaginary characters or DoT characters.

Also, as a F2P I avoid going after LC's/weapons they need too much of jades/warps in which I can pull multiple characters.",[],,0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well I am currently playing Genshin Impact (my first gacha game) as well as Honkai Star Rail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gacha games just work on luck and you have to accept the game is made that way especially when a 5star character is on standard banner, you have to assume you are never gonna get it. In Genshin its been 3 years and I haven&amp;#39;t got Jean yet, got Keqing last month after almost 3 years, when I lost pity.  Don&amp;#39;t have some weapons that I wish I could have but you got to make do with what you got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most HSR content can be completed using the free characters but still if you want to make it easy, we need to keep an eye on upcoming character banners and save premium currency because on limited banners at least we have a guarantee that after specific pulls (ie 160 pulls worth of jades/pass) you gonna get it. Trying to spend premium currency on something that has no guarantee is not the way to go with gacha games, it&amp;#39;s a hard lesson for those who don&amp;#39;t understand this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In HSR, pulling for Silverwolf,Seele, DHIL, Kafka, Fu Xuan, Ruan Mei, etc These are some OP characters that will help you clear most of the content with ease, along with some 4star buffers that you can mostly get with previous banners so far like Pela, Asta, Tingyun, Gunafien.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can easily clear most of the content.&lt;/p&gt;

The more you can fit basic functions into colored and multicolored sources, the more your commander functions.  Also, you have green.  You have very little need of colorless ramp.

You seem to have tooled this as a humans matter deck for... very little reason.  Only a couple payoffs, most of which are enabled by your commander anyways, and in exchange you are running some cards your commander really doesn't care about.  And some I'm not entirely sure why they're in the list at all, like Humble Defector; you are not that hard up for card draw and don't have a way to benefit from giving it to your opponents.

Your curve is not as lean as you seem to think it is, and the multiple colors make getting the correct mana as much an issue as getting enough of it.

Let's talk ramp.  \[\[Atalan Jackal\]\] is one of the best cards you can possibly put in the deck.  Repeatable ramp that fixes you and one of the best carriers for Aragorn's green pump you can ask for.  \[\[Bloom Tender\]\] will usually tap for four.  \[\[Faeburrow Elder\]\] does the same for one more mana, but that one more mana is a white mana for your commander's best trigger.  \[\[Katilda Dawnhart Prime\]\] turns all of your humans into mana dorks, including herself, for two mana and gives you two Aragorn triggers.  \[\[Dryad of the Ilysian Grove\]\] is perfect fixing from your lands and extra land drops.  \[\[Prosperous Partnership\]\] can tap your 1/1 humans for treasure.  \[\[Trace of Abundance\]\] is a ramp enchantment that gives you three triggers.   
 Then we have more rank and file options, as two drops who tap for 1.  \[\[Kiora's Follower\]\], \[\[Black Market Tycoon\]\], \[\[Zhur-Taa Druid\]\] and \[\[Steward of Valeron\]\] all give you two triggers.  \[\[Maraleaf Pixie\]\] does that and is also a flier, making it a good carrier for Aragorn's green pump; even if you discount the other two drops who tap for 1, do not underestimate the value of a flier with incidental utility.  If you have your commander out, Maraleaf Pixie and Manamorphose is 8 damage to somebody's face.

\[\[Tome of the Guildpact\]\] is a replacement for Vanquisher's Banner that does what the deck wants, and is a rock besides.  This is a commander who asks for more multicolored spells than human spells.

\[\[Safewright Quest\]\] is not ramp, but it is fixing if you have duals with basic land typing.  Even taplands are okay as long as you go overboard.  And they're preferable to the gain/scry lands.  If you draw it late, it's two Aragorn triggers off on mana.

And on the topic of not ramp but fixing, the LotR one mana land type cyclers are all good.  Especially \[\[Lorien Revealed\]\] and \[\[Eagles of the North\]\] because they're pretty decent to just cast, but just being able to cycle to get whatever colors you need if you have duals with basic land typings is very good, especially in such a color intensive deck.  Even if you never cast them, \[\[Oliphant\]\] and \[\[Generous Ent\]\] are good just to cycle.  Shocks seem out of the price range, which is fine; you have access to three different battle lands, which are all pretty cheap and have an okay untap condition, and the common typed duals from Dominaria that are all dirt cheap; having typing is more valuable than scry 1 or gain 1 life.

Board wipes!  Do not run Supreme Verdict.  DO NOT RUN SUPREME VERDICT.  You are the creature based deck.  You do not play the no-questions-asked nuke-all-creatures board wipe.  You demand it.  Never slot in a board wipe without a plan to come out ahead from it.  Consider instead \[\[Incandescent Aria\]\].  It's less universal in its coverage, but you generate far more value from it, your commander survives it, and every green trigger will be able to pump a key nontoken creature above its damage threshold, including the green trigger you get off casting Aria itself.

\[\[Manamorphose\]\] is one of the freest spells ever printed.  Just a bad idea of a card.  It replaces itself both in terms of card advantage and mana, fixes the mana you put into it, and gives you two Aragorn triggers.

Other cards to look at.

Your Aragorn tokens are not just humans.  They are humans.  \[\[Harbin Vanguard Aviator\]\] gives your entire board flying if you swing with a bunch of soldiers.

Your Aragorn tokens are not just soldiers.  They are humans.  \[\[Goldbug, Humanity's Ally\]\] will draw you cards and protect your attacking humans.  Though he may die in the process.

Your Aragorn tokens are not just humans.  They're 1 power creatures.  \[\[Rigo, Streetwise Mentor\]\] draws you cards when you send them off to die a horrible pointless death.  Note that he says when you attack a player with one or more tokens, so if you send one 1/1 at each of 3 opponents, you draw for each individual player.  Very pedantic.  Such card draw.

This deck can go unreasonably wide.  The \[\[Starlight Spectacular\]\] It's one of the few monocolored cards I recommend for this commander.  If your deck is working correctly and you cast this, somebody is probably going to die this turn.

One of the only cards to rival the Starlight Spectacular is \[\[Jetmir, Nexus of Revels\]\], which you should have little difficulty getting online.  Shitty little 1/1s are one thing, but shitty little 4/1 vigilance trample double strikers are horrifying.

\[\[Reborn Hope\]\] is a good recursion spell for most of the cards that should be in your deck and two commander triggers.

\[\[Sundering Growth\]\] is a competent removal spell that gives you two commander triggers.

\[\[Endless Detour\]\] is a very flexible removal spell that gives you three triggers.

\[\[Halana and Alena\]\], Lesbians can get you permanent stats from your Aragorn buffs and haste up a fresh attacker.

\[\[Optimus Prime, Hero\]\] is... not a good idea, but close enough to functional that he can be included for the sheer glory of Optimus riding to Gondor's aid.",[],,0,,False,False,[],False,"&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your commander cares about casting colored spells.

Sparkle will be a good pickup for you, but she's much less universal than Ruan Mei. Considering the fact that you don't have a Bronya she should be a fairly worthwhile unit and should work very well with your Seele. 

DHIL synergizes well with Sparkle, but if you don't care for his kit/playstyle and already have imaginary coverage you might want to wait for a Jingliu rerun and or wait and see how powerful Acheron is.

Current estimates for 2.0 jade income seem to be around 110-120 pulls with all of MOC/PF. 

I wouldn't pull Kafka unless you specifically want to play DoT teams. Black Swan is in a similar position though I believe she'll perform perfectly fine as a wind dps even without Kafka. DoT teams are not particularly powerful and for most people require building units they don't normally use. It does however seem like we're getting a DoT buffing Pure Fiction in 2.0.

When building teams you ideally will match the weakness of the enemy for every character i.e mono quantum against quantum weak enemies. Enemies have an inherent resistance to attacks from elements they're not weak to and can have resistances that make it impossible to inflict freeze, burn, etc.

Because of the inherent damage resist you want to try and make sure your DPS character(s) are of the correct typing as your enemies. Type matters far less for supports and sustains because you generally only care about the buffs/debuffs/heals/shields they give your team.

Brute forcing is doable but requires a lot of investment and diminishing returns get quite bad.

Path coverage is generally pointless outside of function/role.

A few thoughts:

&gt;
What if the whimsical world-building of Neverland collided with the sizzling romance of A Court of Thorns and Roses? Enter [Title], an 85,000-word NA romantic fantasy steeped in Scottish folklore.

&gt;Title] is perfect for fans of The Cruel Prince seeking more spice or those who champion damaged heroines reclaiming power, as seen in The Plated Prisoner series. As a Scottish journalist, my debut is a love letter to my homeland. I'm querying you as [specific reason]

try to leave out the rethoric questions!! And maybe narrow it down to one info section and two comps. (possible comps that aren't as huge as cruel prince or Acotar: the very secret society of irregular witches, once upon a broken heart for whimsical, I think plated prisoner is good on the spice front)

&gt;Alyth, a foundling abandoned at birth, yearns for more beyond her life on a remote Scottish isle. Yet she’s trapped by a sense of duty to her alcoholic foster mother. On Halloween, a fateful encounter with a blood-thirsty pirate sends Alyth falling into a pool of starlight, transporting her to Caella—a magical world where creatures like kelpies, selkies, and unicorns exist beyond the pages of a storybook.

I really like this first paragraph! It sets the tone and introduces us to the world and character. I'm just wondering WHEN we are... And if we're in present day scottland how a pirate gets there?

&gt;She's rescued from the pirate by Evander, a jaded heir of the realm's ruling bloodline turned exile. He whisks her to the Hollow, an enchanting forest sanctuary where fairies sprout from within flowers and spring blooms eternally. While the allure of adventure tempts Alyth, guilt ultimately drives her to return home, as she's likely presumed dead after her disappearance. However, Evander delivers a crushing blow: the portal only opens once each year, leaving her stranded in a strange new world.

&gt;Alyth and Evander work together to unravel why the ruthless pirate captain, Atlas Bones, seeks to capture her, while she also confronts her ties to a magical Caellean bloodline. Yet as she unlocks her past, Evander's remains shrouded in shadows, and her budding desire for the enigmatic outcast wars with distrust. Can she believe his claims that danger lurks beyond the Hollow, or is it merely a ploy to keep her caged? Regardless, his presence is a bandage for her wounded soul, and sparks fly when he saves her from the jaws of a malevolent water horse.

There's a lot of greatness here and more of that unique atmosphere and world building! (maybe a bit too much) This section reads a lot like a synopsis instead of a query. Make sure you try to follow the basic query format.
- Paragraph 1: character
- Paragraph 2: conflict
- Paragraph 3: consequences/stakes
I think you can find a way to combine these two paragraphs into a compelling conflict section. Make sure it reads a bit voicy instead of that dry summary tone listing events.

&gt;With the clock ticking down on the portal reopening, each passing moment brings Alyth closer to safety. However, a summons from Calla's tyrannical rulers and the relentless pursuit of Atlas Bones and his crew force Alyth to sharpen both her wits and her sword to survive. And, as she’s about to learn, danger wears many charming disguises.

With the last paragraph it's all about stakes stakes stakes! I think you're already doing a great job at mixing hooking premises with vagueness, but maybe try to be just a tiny bit clearer here? (is there a love triangle going on? Hint at it. Are Atlas and Evander the same person or related? Hint at it. What is at stake? What is the world shattering consequence if Alyth doesn't succeed? Why does this story need to happen and be told? What is the EMOTIONAL conflict for Alyth? Has she never loved before? Trust issues because of her parents abandoning her?

It also takes .LCP files, and can also import characters and NPC's made in compcon.  If you're not playing in a VTT, compcon.app is still really good for actually running combats for IRL play.

retrogrademinis dot com, click mechs in the top left corner, and make sure all your players make their own mech tokens there for a sickass consistent look.  really fun to kitbash with if you're handy with gimp or photoshop.  chop shop has a bunch of stuff other people kitbashed or edited if you want something pretty right away, and the factions tab inside that is a fantastic resource for getting a ton of NPC token artwork realy to kill players with.

starlight-furnace dot itch dot io is sick if you want to be extra and do isometric maps to match the tokens, it really *adds* something if the big stompy mechs players are piloting actually look tall relative to buildings and stuff on the map, but it is quite a bit more effort and i don't know any resource of premade isometric lancer maps.

If you&amp;#39;re wanting to play in a VTT, Foundry has a Lancer module that&amp;#39;s top tier, significantly better than the 5e system in terms of automating the important stuff.  It also takes .LCP files, and can also import characters and NPC&amp;#39;s made in compcon.  If you&amp;#39;re not playing in a VTT, compcon.app is still really good for actually running combats for IRL play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;retrogrademinis dot com, click mechs in the top left corner, and make sure all your players make their own mech tokens there for a sickass consistent look.  really fun to kitbash with if you&amp;#39;re handy with gimp or photoshop.  chop shop has a bunch of stuff other people kitbashed or edited if you want something pretty right away, and the factions tab inside that is a fantastic resource for getting a ton of NPC token artwork realy to kill players with.&lt;/p&gt;
