series

* Saga Norén in The Bridge (original Scandinavian version). It has also had multiple remakes, though not all the remakes retain the autistic main character. I know The Bridge (American-Mexican) and The Tunnel (British-French) do, but Der Pass doesn't. 4 seasons of glorious Scandinoir so it's on the heavier side. Goes pretty deep into relationships as well.
* Rebecca Blithely in Strange Empire. The only period piece I've been able to find. Canadian western set in the late 19th century. The main cast are all women.
* Woo Young-woo in Extraordinary Attorney Woo. Korean law procedural with an autistic main character.
* Birgit in Clan (2012 Belgian series). She and her sisters conspire to kill their brother-in-law, dark comedy kinda vibes. It's a bit difficult to find online. There is an Irish remake on Apple TV+ (titled Bad Sisters), though the remade version is not said to be autistic. It's a pretty close adaptation though, and they retain a lot of the autistic traits of the original character—so if you squint, you can definitely see the autism seeping through.
* the indie series What's the Rule? has only produced one episode and they're waiting for more funding before making the rest. but the cast and crew are majority neurodivergent and the episode is free to watch on youtube ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZE0LnYEKIOQ))
* Quinni in Heartbreak High (2022 version). I have not watched it yet but word of mouth says it's good. Autistic actress who also fought with Sia on Twitter when Music came out.
* Sara Eriksson in Young Royals. Again, didn't watch it but word of mouth. Also an autistic actress.
* Juliette Destoop in The Twelve (2019 Belgian series). Side character but pretty nice arc nonetheless. &gt;!she gets diagnosed with autism as a teenager, which her dad struggles to accept. her dad is undiagnosed autistic and is one of the main characters!&lt;
* Astrid Nielsen in Astrid et Raphaëlle. I've only watched one episode but I get the vibe that they're really trying to do good. Police type of series, though Astrid is not a detective.
* Fiona Helbron in Elementary. Only appears in a couple of episodes.

movies

* Lola in Cha Cha Real Smooth. Personally not a huge fan but it got a lot of praise and has an autistic actress. Coming of age type of thing.
* Katy in Acceptable Damage. British indie drama about bullying. Autistic actress.
* Laura Yip in For Izzy. Indie coming of age type of thing. Haven't heard a lot about it. I liked it.
* Wendy in Please Stand By. Coming of age, I think it is also classified as a road trip movie? One of my favourites.
* Lily in The Rider. Contemporary western. The cast are all non-professional actors who play fictionalized versions of themselves, so Lily is portrayed by an autistic person.
* Isabelle Sorensen in Mozart and the Whale. It's a bit of a controversial movie because it helped popularize the autistic savant stereotype, but it's also based on a real-life autistic couple and they liked it so I can't really hate it.

books and comics

* Denise Lichtveld in On the Edge of Gone. Autistic author. YA science fiction.
* Saitou Megumi in That's My Atypical Girl. Ongoing manga series. Pretty heavy stuff but it's the first major manga series about autism since With the Light.
* Rosa Reyes in FBP: Federal Bureau of Physics. American science-fiction comic. Don't remember much of it but I didn't hate it.

(there are a lot more books but I don't know a lot of them)

other stuff

* Luna in the Iceland short film Rules of the Game (Reglur Leiksins). The writer/actor is also autistic.
* River Wyles in the game To the Moon. It's a lot of story and not a whole lot of actual gameplay so you can also just watch a playthrough.
* I've always been partial to Simone Cole in the video game Clive Barker's Jericho, though I can't quite put my finger on why",,,,May2020bb,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_z3rqt4,,dark,False,/r/aspergirls/comments/z3rqt4/any_recommendation_for_aspiegirl_representation/ixnbev1/,public,False,t1_ixnbev1,,,[],1669318132,r/aspergirls,0,,,,,,1551455699.0,1671082541.0,,,

Goo? More life Goo(f)  

11. **Flood (4/10)**   

I get the love, it’s lyrically highly intelligent and witty. I adore songs like Birdhouse In your Soul and “Istanbul” but the rest just either bored me (We Want a Rock) or irritated me to no end (They might be Giants! BOY!)  

10. **Fear of a Black Planet (5/10)**  

FBP contains some of the most fearless and iconic bars (Elvis was a hero to most but he never meant shit to me…) and the beats in 911 and Terror Dome and a few others are still awesome. Flav’s hype shit never gets old. Unfortunately, it’s 20 tracks and over an hour long and there’s quite a bit of filler especially towards the end. Wish it was much more consistent.  

9. **Reading, Writing, and Arithmetic (6/10)**  

I love how Smiths sounding this is. Songs like I Kicked a Boy immediately reminded me of Johnny Marr (my favorite guitarist of all time!) This is a lovely album and I adore this jangle pop sound. I don’t really see myself coming back to this one though, as a whole it was just nice but not too many standout tracks. I also don’t think the vocalist is that strong. Lead guitar is definitely the highlight.  

8. **Rust In Peace (7/10)**  

Gotta respect Megadeth, the solos on here absolutely shred and the first two tracks go HARD, Just a big dumb fun album, being somewhat of a metalhead myself, this was a fun listen. Um but also Dawn Patrol sucks :(  

7. **Bossanova (7/10)**  

Pixies are one my all time favorite bands. Come On Pilgrim, Surfer Rosa, and Doolittle are all 10s for me, no question. Their third LP, Bossanova, couldn’t quite reach the highs of their first two but it’s still lots of fun. From the throwback surf music to the beautiful outro to The Happening, there’s some good shit here.  

6. **Repeater (8/10)**  

Being born and raised in the DC area you think I would already be a big Fugazi fan but nope, just never really listened to them. Until this survivor. Damn, this album kicks major ass! You can just hear how many bands were influenced by this band and specifically this historic debut. Solid shit, makes me want to break stuff.  

5. **PITATPR (8/10)**  

The coolest of the cool. The vibe of this record is just so smooth and cool and Q-Tip’s flow is just so effortlessly suave. Even when they’re talking about how they do not like ham and eggs, I’m still on board because shit’s just fun.   

4. **Violator (8/10)**   

Enjoy the Silence is one of the most beautiful and most perfect songs ever created. BY HUMANS.  

3. **Nowhere (9/10)**  

More beautiful and lush shoe gaze, lots of noise and dreaminess. Guitar sound so good that I honestly wasn’t even paying attention to the lyrics. Vapor Trail is one of the most perfect songs ever written, my god.   

2. **Twin Peaks (10/10)**  

The opening sequence to twin Peaks is the most perfect opening to any show ever made. The idyllic Twin Peaks set to the most beautiful piece of music, here in two forms: The instrumental theme to the series and then Julee Cruise’s stunning Falling. What was so brilliant about Badalmenti’s dreamy soundtrack were the dark undertones, how can someone make something sound so beautiful and yet so sinister? Just listen to Laura palmer’s Theme, half of the song sounds like a 70s horror flick while the other sounds like the ending to the most romantic movie you’ve ever seen. In addition to the classic dreamier tracks you also get the jazzy bass-prominent songs like Audrey’s Theme. Like a damn fine cup of coffee, this album is stellar perfection. Just need a slice of cherry pie.  

1. **Heaven or Las Vegas (10/10)**  

As far as shoegaze goes I think this is one of the greats. Up there with Loveless and Souvlaki. The title track is honestly one of the most perfect songs I’ve ever heard. Probably Top 50 song of all time for me. I love the last track too. Lyrics? I have no gosh darn clue, can’t comprehend a word of this 9or any Cocteau Twins song for that matter).

ARTWORK DISCLAIMER: head in the art has come across as blackface, this was unintentional and will be changed to grey.

Long time lurker, first time poster here... i think (don't check my history).

I'm a Kiwi Producer/Songwriter living in New Zealand. I've begun working on an EP that i'm looking to finish up by end of Jan and release in February. I was wondering if there were any instrumentalists/vocalists/producers who'd like to collaborate on any of these tracks.

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MMW6T8BVt-Tw3hSETvIIkJlpKP35iVhF

I'll be adding more tracks in here as time goes on.

an outline of the tracks so far:

Vacant - a song about loss and breaking someones heart over keeping secrets.

Unititled Record 40442069 - A track that started as an i-phone recording with myself playing and humming a guitar. I then added some Bass, Drums and got a friend Pavel to record some saxophone. I then layered some initial Guitar. This track is meant to be an intermission of sorts.

Pang - A song about depression/losing friends, and standing up for who'll you'll ride for in the long run.

New York City - a song about seeing the world, making new experiences. A sort of Juxtaposition between places i'd go/have gone years ago vs today. (had verses recorded which I've now removed) Also, saxophone by Pavel.

Bed of Roses - a song about depression, reaching out for your friends when times are tough, leaning on others if you can.

Case Closed - a cheesy pop song about a break up

I'm not unlucky in love (fuck it up) - a song about finding love and always managing to screw it up. Vocal melodies etc not final.

Weird Bass Beat - a cool beat. thats it. so far...

Disclaimer: Not all songs will make it on the EP but i'm trying to make as much music as possible and refine. All this music is subject to change on a whim haha everything is only at very early demo stages at this point. Get in quick if your keen.

No other gacha games gives as much as Sdorica do. And I’m not complaining the low SSR chars percentage in the infuse section. There were a lot more gacha games with astronomically lower rate of SSR percentage. It’s just that I kinda feel the games need a fresh new updates and overhaul in the guild system. 70 replays of the same stage finding FBP were dull af and frankly took the enjoyment of Sdorica imo. 

Older events were planned better and gives you challenge (Balzac Heritage, the Deemo event) while the MZ just shoves you with a repetitive quest. On the older events (I forgot the name, probably lunar event) you can convert your crystallines to crystals, which is an incentive to trade a free resource to a paid resource, while MZ would punish you if you did not have crystallines available to buy the ice cream. Don’t have 1700+ crystallines? Then you wont get Naya MZ.

The old exploration quest were pretty pointless imo and did not give you a major benefit for your chars. You’re just grinding for crystals and crystallines. 

It’s not that I’m hating them for being reasonable, I just lose interest with the game after that much grinding, like when you are told to listen to your favorite music on repeat for 100 times.

So, you can read the game [here](http://schirduans.com/david/2015/04/200-word-rpg-challenge.html/force-blade-punk-2),  but I'll probably end up writing up the whole thing here as I go through it sentence by sentence and tell you why it's great. 

&gt;You are a FORCE-BLADE PUNK, a teenage murderpop superstar with a mono-edged flick knife and a cracked porcelain mask. 

Straight out of that gate, sets up a world and the characters and what they do, who they are. It doesn't need to tell you what any of these words mean, because they're evocative enough that you fill in your own blanks. 

&gt;You no dangerous criminals on TV for money in a neon futurescape and compete with other punks for love, honour and sponsorship deals. 

So, sets up what the main conflicts in the game are: killing criminals and competing with the other punks for sponsorship deals. All the games I've played of FBP have been about punks competing to get a lucrative sponsorship deal. Usually Versace. Often, they start sponsored by someone already (Disney, subway, skittles, etc) 

Character creation is just a couple of completely non-mechanical questions. What do you look like? What's your signature weapon? Who do you love, who do you hate? Reinforces that player driven conflict and drama is encouraged, but also quickly gives everyone a little something to be invested about. 

Conflict resolution is the most basic Otherkind dice style resolution, but that single word ""ashamed"" changes the game. Now, since you're competing for brand sponsors as well, and presumably you have fans, each time to roll it's not just about doing well, it's about looking good. Bad rolls mean you have to determine if doing well is more important than your personal brand? Maybe you'll become a sellout. Maybe someone will see you fuck up and get an advantage over you.

This game always plays out like a music video, for me. There's always music playing and i imagine a cross between the videos for Bad Blood by T Swift and Kill V. Maim by Grimes. I think what this game drives home about microgames like this is that, more than anything, they need to be evocative.

And I actually do dig your style no joke, and that you're super enthused, I just don't wanna promise I can work on something with you and then be the guy to flake myself. I just finished that collab and now I plan on studying for like a solid month so I can pass my Real Estate exam and start making some cash. Then I can spend money on more equipment, focus on music, and really get down with it. I wish I were able to focus on and post music regularly but I gotta focus on getting paid first before I can do that at the moment.

How about I hit you up or you hit me up again in like 2 months? Maybe 3.
