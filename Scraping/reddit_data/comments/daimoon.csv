The percolating not being as good is either people not caring about their water levels or not having a bowl with enough airflow, seriously the one I use is basically just a straight 14mm hole with a few catches in it (i also am using a 14mm to 18mm adaptor), might be worth to just go to a headshop and pay a bit extra for a bowl with the biggest hole you can find, i use screens with mine got em for like $12 for 500, ultimately that is personal preference tho.",[],,,,False,False,[],False,,{},,,False,False,True,t3_fjjjc3,,,,/r/chinaglass/comments/fjjjc3/function_video/fkr3p7t/,public,False,,,,[],1584461232,r/chinaglass,0,,,,,,1414373566.0,1591955844.0,,False,

I've got a big bowl with tons of airflow, absolutely drains the flower when I hit it. Honestly taking a big rip off it is comparable to taking a gravity bong hit but much smoother. Getting the right water level takes a bit of practice, if you have friends have them watch you hit it so you can see what level it bubbles at the most. Also pick up some alcohol free cranberry extract and put 3-5 drops in both chambers, keeps the bong so much cleaner, i just run water through it and the shit comes right off and the cranberry extract prevents resin from sticking where the water touches. The top perc still builds some resin but 99% isopropyl helps with that, people were saying salt is bad on this bong but eh i might just do that anyway and run water through it. 

If you want a function vid i can provide one, but theres been others in the thread so far that get the idea across. Ultimately i'd say this bong is great for both taking big milky rips of flower (be sure to get a bowl with good airflow to accommodate) and for showing off a nice looking bong to your friends and saying you paid under $100 for the whole thing. I got mine from daimoon btw

Here is a photo of the bong clean, with downstem i had from my very first silicone bong and an ash-catcher that I’ve had for a few years. This downstem is 18mm and holds an 18mm bowl.

Keeping a dog is recognized in the quran. It is not prohibited. 


&gt; Currently I dont even pray 5x a day except for friday prayers, what are your thoughts on this?

Having a dog is nothing compared to this. Protecting your prayer is one of the most important things that separates those who go to heaven.

http://quran.com/70/22-23
&gt; إلا المصلين

&gt; الذين هم على صلاتهم دائمون

&gt; Except the observers of prayer -

&gt; Those who are constant in their prayer

http://quran.com/70/34-35

&gt; والذين هم على صلاتهم يحافظون


&gt; أولئك في جنات مكرمون

&gt; And those who are protecting of their prayer:

&gt; They will be in gardens, honored.


The first word used here is daimoon, which has the sense of never missing prayers. 



My suggestion is don't worry about the dog. Keep it. But don't miss prayer. Ever.
