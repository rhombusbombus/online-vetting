###3. Fanart/cosplay must directly link to the source
* If the art in question is **original content (OC)** re-hosting on reddit/imgur etc. is fine. Please reply to this comment if you are the original artist.
* This means you must submit the fanart as a link post. With the original source of the image on the artists website, as the url. Including the artist's name in the title is polite.
* The original source is almost always on pixiv.net, deviantart.com, twitter, instagram, tumblr or artstation.
* **Here are some tools to help you find the original artist:** | [saucenao.com](http://saucenao.com/) | [Google Images](https://images.google.com/) |
* The following websites are not valid sources:
weheartit.com, pinterest.com, zerochan.net, dailyanimeart.com, alphacoders.com, any website with ""wallpaper"" or ""booru"" in it, etc... these are aggregate sites which only have re posted artwork.
 * **If the website with the art is hard to view on any occasion** (such is often the case with twitter), please post an imgur mirror within the body of a text post along side the source to the artists page. [Observe this post on /r/anime as an example of what it would look like.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/343209378737946625/383725450347937795/Screen_Shot_2017-11-24_at_21.07.26.png)
* **If you edited someone else's work, If you took inspiration from someone else's work, if you copied someone else's work, you still need to give the original artist credit.** This is required for anything other than official anime/manga/game art.
* Limit yourself to **one fanart submission within approximately 24 hours.** A little flexibility will be allowed, especially with original content or official art unless it's been posted in a noticeably spam-like way.
* **Do not post art from the same user multiple days in a row.** Your account could be viewed as a promotional account under the self promotion rule and possibly banned. If you'd like to show people someone's art, post an album either as a link post or in the comments.

So long story cut short. I am a manager of a residential building and we have 2 parking spaces out front. One of the managers of another residential building nearby (same company but different client) wants to park in one of the two spaces out front.

This means that when contractors come to do works in our building, they have to park in a car park over 15 minute walk away and lug all their tools/equipment to my building.

So everyday when I arrived at work, he was parked in the 2nd space. He wasn't asking or notifying me - just parking and then walking to his building. 

So after 4 occasions, I told the other manager he can't park there anymore because I need the space for contractors. However I said that when contractors are not on site, he can park there. I also asked him to just check with me first before parking there. 

So a week goes by and I send some reports over to him that I need him to submit and he doesn't reply to my emails or do the work. (He usually would within 24-48hrs).

Then today, I get a call from our boss saying that he is very upset because he now has to pay for parking and that I shouldn't prioritise contractors over him. He has made an official complaint about me because of this. Bear in mind our contractors are doing maintenance and there are no places to park outside (we are on a main road). Also bear in mind our buildings are not owned by the same client and essentially nothing to do with him. She says that I need to let him park there and tell contractors to park in the car park 15min away and carry their tools. She says I need to apologise and get respect him as he has worked there for 10 years.

I counteracted this with the fact he has been giving me silent treatment for a week and he actually hasn't spoken to me about this. I also made sure she was aware I had offered him to park there but he must ask for permission first. 

AITA???

[],False,,evmd,1400852017.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_gonnb,False,False,"A 2012 SCOTUS ruling made it possible for Jones, the guy on trial, to get a hearing. He was granted an evidentiary hearing that could lead to a retrial or an acquittal, and part of that hearing involved presenting the evidence that shows that his previous legal counsel failed him spectacularly and that the whole police investigation was basically a sham. 

At the end of it all, the evidence was so strong that the judge concluded that no jury would've convicted Jones of any crime at all if he'd had adequate representation, because the evidence for his innocence was so strong (and there was literally no police case, they didn't do, like, any investigation at all).

And then the state argued that, no, he should still be executed for this crime, because it wasn't right that the judge took all this evidence and testimony that hadn't been heard in the original trial - when the WHOLE POINT of the hearing was that the defendant's representation HADN'T DONE THIS. That was literally why he was granted the hearing. 

So, the conclusion now is that if your lawyers are so extremely bad that they leave out literally all evidence supporting your innocence, and you're granted a hearing on that basis, the only evidence you're allowed is the evidence submitted in your original trial. You know, the one where your lawyer didn't submit the evidence that would have cleared your name, which is the entire reason for this hearing? 

You had unconstitutionally bad lawyers, and you are because of that granted a hearing. In that hearing, you have to prove that your defense was this bad, and here's the evidence for that. Except now you can't present any new evidence, so your hearing for potentially clearing your name (and saving your life) still hinges on the incompetent, unconstitutionally bad defense from the original trial. But you're having the hearing because that defense was so bad and part of that defense being so bad is that they didn't submit the evidence that would've cleared you! 

It's fucked up.

Hey there, your submission was removed from /r/listentothis because your account does not yet meet our minimum karma requirements to post links. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just listen and enjoy the music. Please read this entire reply because we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and [the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq). Next, read the [listentothis introduction](/r/listentothis/wiki/reddiquette) to learn how the sub operates. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment but not submit music to listentothis. Earning downvotes will block your comments, so comment wisely. New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit music links in listentothis. We can't divulge this score, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you are planning to submit your own music or the music of someone with whom you have a personal association** (e.g. friend, neighbor, colleague, etc.), you may do so [only as a comment in our weekly Melting Pot thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/search?q=self%3Ayes+%22melting+pot%22+-flair%3Amodpost&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week) after your account is at least one day old. Additionally, we recommend reading the [guidelines for self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) as violating these rules can result in a site-wide shadowban - that's simply the way reddit operates and is outside of our control. 

**If you wish to advertise your music in listentothis**, you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* without the need to earn upvotes. 

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician**, listentothis is not the place for your first musical creations. This sub is for *finished* tracks, and even then, you may post [only as a comment in our weekly Melting Pot thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/search?q=self%3Ayes+%22melting+pot%22+-flair%3Amodpost&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week).

It was a joke and I wish I hadn’t. Sighting singing for me comes very naturally as it’s been a part of my music lessons since I was 3. In the class there are 2 melodies due per class that you sing for a recording and submit them. Pretty easy. There’s a few tests where it’s just you and the instructor. 

Aural skills also came very naturally for me, but I had been doing it for awhile. This is dictation. They play melodies/chord progressions over the speakers and you have to right it down. For me, chord progressions were a lot harder in AS 2. It’s not like AP theory where it’s on the piano and you have to pick out notes, it’s like the background track to real songs. There is typically 7-8 melodies due each class period that you are expected to transcribe on your own. 

Theory is more relatable to AP Theory. It’s the theory of music. You’re learning to identify things, work them into your own compositions, and identify them in others. I find it very enjoyable and would retake them in a heartbeat, but some people really struggle with the concepts.

You will be met with titles that are not exact to our search, or what we went to college for.  I have had recruiters and one psychologist tell me that its a very specific market. Sometimes we can get to focused on the title &amp; salary where we really want to be and not settling.

Getting back on the track.  You came out of college HCA in 2017 so the job market is always evolving.  Congrats on the Family.  Covid definitely made things different. But! Right now is the perfect time to get what you want as a job.  People are dropping jobs when they don't fit their desire. Everyone has more or less gave up on working and the pickings are slim for the actual employers. People want that traditional feel and want employers to know that their time is valuable outside of the role.  No one wants to work for companies that do not care about them.

Take a look at your resume.  Is it outdated?  5-10 years ago and does it need a refresh?  Possibly?  I constantly refresh and get tips on my resume.  You want to set your resume to compete with algorithms and HR staff that have six seconds to look for the meat of your resume.  Does your resume say ""I am a HCA""? Have someone else read your resume and ask them what does it say.   Tips!!

1. Use clean font:  Use a front that is clean and stay away from a curl font. It has to be easy to read within six seconds.
2. Don't put your BA/MBA/MS educational credentialing after your name. The market is just over saturated with MBA or some other title.  Leave all that to people the Doctor, PHD or Accountant. Designate this for people with specific degrees.  Save this for the education section. Reason: Algorithm will exclude you from opportunities. Companies HR will see this and think you are over qualified and your only looking for this one job.
3. Passing the six seconds! That long winded objective paragraph at the top of your resume that says ""self importance to you and your objective"". This is a turn off and we skip right over it and we look right at your work history.  This was a tactic used 10 years ago and dated! Replace this area with your key skill sets, a couple of columns will do.  What really resonates what your goals should be in these columns. Should reflect the core skills for the job in which you are applying to. This will say hey I got the skills to pay the bills! Its a check list that says to the hiring manager or review I got the set skills you want.
4. Bullet points - You want to quantify your accomplishments with numbering 1,2,3 ect because numbers are easy to understand to the reader.  This will reflect to the reader the depth and scope of your work and it allows for fewer words. Add anything that will allow quantify, or maximizing you and allow the reader to access you faster. Greater chances you will be passed along to the hiring manager.
5. Limit the number of bullet points!  I have had some people submit resumes with an absurd amount of bullet points, 3-5 pages long. Don't do this.  Think of this as a self marketing and you don't need to put every single thing down on the resume.  If a hiring manager sees skills that is not needed then you run a greater risk of making it to the NO pile. Simplify the text and tease the reader. Get them excited about you. You want to get them to pick up the phone and set the interview or the caller will ask can you tell me little more. Save the extra for the in person talk.  Good sign is when they are calling you and asking ""can you tell me more!"" Then this is where you sell yourself.   Rule 3-5, no more than 7 bullet points for every employer that really market the meat of your skills and tease the reader. Keep your resume to no more than 2 pages.
6. One page resume.  Tons of these and they hold about as much important information as a screen door holding water! 10 years ago these worked when jobs weren't available. 2 pages!
7. When you get the call!! Hello?    Example: ""I applied, and will have interview today, but the lady mentioned about Pharmacy Research program so not sure how it works.""   Any time you get a interview.  Pull this job description that you have applied to.  Read over it.  If there is something you do not understand research it.   Todays interview require you to do your homework.  Don't go into this blind. You want to understand what you are getting into and don't waste your time on opportunities that steer you away from your career goals. You might get into something that is not a good fit.

Is is certainly superior to relying only on one's own sagacity.  That said, the problem still remains - man alone is incapable of proper interpretation of scripture.  There is such hubris in it.  Even relying on 'experts' - which ones?  There are many experts and few of them agree.  Only through the Magisterium, which has been guided by the Holy Spirit since Pentecost, can one begin to understand the Bible.  We lay our hubris aside, as well as our reliance solely on the intellects of man, and trust in the Holy Spirit to guide our church.

&gt;challenged some hard lined views I had in defending Catholicism

Because I care about the truth, and expect you do too, please tell me what some of these views were, how they were challenged.

&gt;and in the end, I found that whilst I agreed with many conservative areas of the church, some required a more egalitarian approach for my liking

Which required this approach?

&gt;It’s my home country and I’m very proud of the theologians and the church in and of itself

It's important to frame your faith in your homeland.  I'm Irish, and there's a lot there for a Catholic.  England too has a long Catholic tradition, far longer than Henry's C of E.  There are many saints to be proud of, Catholics who - despite any focus the C of E gives them - were thoroughly Roman Catholic.  Even recently here, St John Henry Newman, and at the time of the start of the C of E, all the English martyrs.

&gt;the C of E has been incredibly conservative in all the right areas for me personally.

I hope you don't feel I'm being too gruff here, but this is a very protestant statement.  ""For me.""  ""It's good for me.""  ""I agree with this or that.""  The emphasis on the self, and on one's own personal opinions and tastes and preferences as higher in priority than perhaps all else.  I submit to Rome, and am better for it.  When I disagree with the holy Roman Catholic Magisterium, I assume - rightly so - that I am wrong and they are right.  If I seek *why* I'm wrong and they're right, the answers are there.  It may not always suit my palate, but neither does medicine or healthy food.

&gt;The C of E does not need “power”,

I do not mean the power of man.  The power of the holy Mass, the power of our sacraments, sacramentals, holy relics and devotions.  You may say the C of E doesn't need power...that's all very well, because it has none.

&gt;it is a house of the lord and we worship Christ just as you do.

Where is Christ in your church?  Do you have the Eucharist as we do?  When I go to mass, Christ is there.  Present.  Not in the way that he's present in my house, which he certainly is, but fully and uniquely present in the Mass.

&gt;I accept your kind intentions if you wish for me to return to the church, and send my blessings to you also

And the same to you.  May the road rise up to meet you. May the wind be always at your back. May the sun shine warm upon your face, The rains fall soft upon your fields, Until we meet again, May God hold you in the palm of His hand.  Your anscestors groan with desire for you to return to your roots, I assure you.  Do not abandon the good, true, and beautiful for what you prefer.
